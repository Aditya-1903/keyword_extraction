Exercise and other non-pharmaceutical interventions for cancer-related fatigue in patients during or after cancer treatment: a systematic review incorporating an indirect-comparisons meta-analysis.,"To assess the relative effects of different types of exercise and other non-pharmaceutical interventions on cancer-related fatigue (CRF) in patients during and after cancer treatment.Systematic review and indirect-comparisons meta-analysis.Articles were searched in PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL and published meta-analyses.Randomised studies published up to January 2017 evaluating different types of exercise or other non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce CRF in any cancer type during or after treatment.Risk of bias assessment with PEDro criteria and random effects Bayesian network meta-analysis.We included 245 studies. Comparing the treatments with usual care during cancer treatment, relaxation exercise was the highest ranked intervention with a standardisedmean difference (SMD) of -0.77 (95% Credible Interval (CrI) -1.22 to -0.31), while massage (-0.78; -1.55 to -0.01), cognitive-behavioural therapy combined with physical activity (combined CBT, -0.72; -1.34 to -0.09), combined aerobic and resistance training (-0.67; -1.01 to -0.34), resistance training (-0.53; -1.02 to -0.03), aerobic (-0.53; -0.80 to -0.26) and yoga (-0.51; -1.01 to 0.00) all had moderate-to-large SMDs. After cancer treatment, yoga showed the highest effect (-0.68; -0.93 to -0.43). Combined aerobic and resistance training (-0.50; -0.66 to -0.34), combined CBT (-0.45; -0.70 to -0.21), Tai-Chi (-0.45; -0.84 to -0.06), CBT (-0.42; -0.58 to -0.25), resistance training (-0.35; -0.62 to -0.08) and aerobic (-0.33; -0.51 to -0.16) showed all small-to-moderate SMDs.Patients can choose among different effective types of exercise and non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce CRF.","['cancer related fatigue', 'exercise', 'indirect comparison metaanalysis', 'network metaanalysis', 'nonpharmaceutical interventions']"
"Effectiveness of conservative interventions including exercise, manual therapy and medical management in adults with shoulder impingement: a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs.","To investigate the effectiveness of conservative interventions for pain, function and range of motion in adults with shoulder impingement.Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised trials.Medline, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Embase and PEDro were searched from inception to January 2017.Randomised controlled trials including participants with shoulder impingement and evaluating at least one conservative intervention against sham or other treatments.For pain, exercise was superior to non-exercise control interventions (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.94, 95% CI -1.69 to -0.19). Specific exercises were superior to generic exercises (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.99 to -0.32). Corticosteroid injections were superior to no treatment (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.26), and ultrasound guided injections were superior to non-guided injections (SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.89 to -0.13). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) had a small to moderate SMD of -0.29 (95% CI -0.53 to -0.05) compared with placebo. Manual therapy was superior to placebo (SMD -0.35, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.01). When combined with exercise, manual therapy was superior to exercise alone, but only at the shortest follow-up (SMD -0.32, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.01). Laser was superior to sham laser (SMD -0.88, 95% CI -1.48 to -0.27). Extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ECSWT) was superior to sham (-0.39, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.01) and tape was superior to sham (-0.64, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.12), with small to moderate SMDs.Although there was only very low quality evidence, exercise should be considered for patients with shoulder impingement symptoms and tape, ECSWT, laser or manual therapy might be added. NSAIDS and corticosteroids are superior to placebo, but it is unclear how these treatments compare to exercise.","['Conservative', 'MetaAnalysis', 'Pain', 'Shoulder Impingement', 'Systematic Review']"
Effectiveness of myopia control interventions: A systematic review of 12 randomized control trials published between 2019 and 2021.,"This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of interventions to control myopia progression. In this systematic review, the primary outcomes were mean differences (MD) between treatment and control groups in myopia progression (D) and axial length (AL) elongation (mm).The following interventions were found to be effective (<i>p</i> < 0.001): highly aspherical lenslets (HAL, 0.80 D, 95% CI, 0.77-0.83; -0.35 mm, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.34), MiSight contact lenses (0.66 D, 95% CI, 0.63-0.69; -0.28 mm, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.27), low dose atropine 0.05% (0.54 D, 95% CI, 0.38-0.70; -0.21 mm, 95% CI-0.28 to -0.14), Biofinity +2.50 D (0.45 D, 95% CI, 0.29, 0.61; -0.24 mm, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.15), defocus incorporated multiple segments [DIMS] (0.44 D, 95% CI, 0.42-0.46; -0.34 mm, 95% CI -0.35 to -0.33) and ortho-k lenses (-0.24 mm, 95% CI -0.33 to -01.5).Low-dose atropine 0.01% was not effective in reducing AL progression in two studies. Treatment efficacy with low-dose atropine of 0.05% showed good efficacy. Spectacles (HAL and DIMS) and contact lenses (MiSight and Biofinity) may confer a comparable treatment benefit compared to atropine, to slow myopia progression.","['axial length', 'efficacy', 'elongation', 'myopia', 'progression', 'systematic review', 'treatment']"
Causal relationships between gut microbiota and programmed cell death protein 1/programmed cell death-ligand 1: A bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.,"Multiple clinical studies have indicated that the gut microbiota influences the effects of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy comprising PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, but the causal relationship is unclear. Because of numerous confounders, many microbes related to PD-1/PD-L1 have not been identified. This study aimed to determine the causal relationship between the microbiota and PD-1/PD-L1 and identify possible biomarkers for ICB therapy.We used bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization with two different thresholds to explore the potential causal relationship between the microbiota and PD-1/PD-L1 and species-level microbiota GWAS to verify the result.In the primary forward analysis, genus_Holdemanella showed a negative correlation with PD-1 [βIVW = -0.25; 95% CI (-0.43 to -0.07); P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.028] and genus_Prevotella9 showed a positive correlation with PD-1 [βIVW = 0.2; 95% CI (0.1 to 0.4); P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.027]; order_Rhodospirillales [βIVW = 0.2; 95% CI (0.1 to 0.4); P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.044], family_Rhodospirillaceae [βIVW = 0.2; 95% CI (0 to 0.4); P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.032], genus_Ruminococcaceae_UCG005 [βIVW = 0.29; 95% CI (0.08 to 0.5); P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.028], genus_Ruminococcus_gnavus_group [βIVW = 0.22; 95% CI (0.05 to 0.4); P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.029], and genus_Coprococcus_2 [βIVW = 0.4; 95% CI (0.1 to 0.6); P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.018] were positively correlated with PD-L1; and phylum_Firmicutes [βIVW = -0.3; 95% CI (-0.4 to -0.1); P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.031], family_ClostridialesvadinBB60group [βIVW = -0.31; 95% CI (-0.5 to -0.11), P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.008], family_Ruminococcaceae [βIVW = -0.33; 95% CI (-0.58 to -0.07); P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.049], and genus_Ruminococcaceae_UCG014 [βIVW = -0.35; 95% CI (-0.57 to -0.13); P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.006] were negatively correlated with PD-L1. The one significant species in further analysis was species_Parabacteroides_unclassified [βIVW = 0.2; 95% CI (0-0.4); P<sub>FDR</sub> = 0.029]. Heterogeneity (P > 0.05) and pleiotropy (P > 0.05) analyses confirmed the robustness of the MR results.","['PD1PDL1', 'bidirectional Mendelian randomization', 'causality', 'gut microbiota', 'pQTL']"
Prevention of hypotension after spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section: a systematic review and network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,"Spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section commonly causes maternal hypotension. This systematic review and network meta-analysis compared methods to prevent hypotension in women receiving spinal anaesthesia for caesarean section. We selected randomised controlled trials that compared an intervention to prevent hypotension with another intervention or inactive control by searching MEDLINE and Embase, Web of Science to December 2018. There was no language restriction. Two reviewers extracted data on trial characteristics, methods and outcomes. We assessed risk of bias for individual trials (Cochrane tool) and quality of evidence (GRADE checklist). We assessed 109 trials (8561 women) and 12 different methods that resulted in 30 direct comparisons. Methods ranked by OR (95%CI) from most effective to least effective were: metaraminol 0.11 (0.04-0.26); norepinephrine 0.13 (0.06-0.28); phenylephrine 0.18 (0.11-0.29); leg compression 0.25 (0.14-0.43); ephedrine 0.28 (0.18-0.43); colloid given before induction of anaesthesia 0.38 (0.24-0.61); angiotensin 2, 0.12 (0.02-0.75); colloid given after induction of anaesthesia 0.52 (0.30-0.90); mephentermine 0.09 (0.01-1.30); crystalloid given after induction of anaesthesia 0.78 (0.46-1.31); and crystalloid given before induction of anaesthesia 1.16 (0.76-1.79). Phenylephrine caused maternal bradycardia compared with control, OR (95%CI) 0.23 (0.07-0.79). Ephedrine lowered umbilical artery pH more than phenylephrine, standardised mean difference (95%CI) 0.78 (0.47-1.49). We conclude that vasopressors should be given to healthy women to prevent hypotension during caesarean section with spinal anaesthesia.","['anaesthesia', 'spinal', 'caesarean section', 'hypotension', 'prevention']"
Comparative efficacy and acceptability of licensed dose intranasal corticosteroids for moderate-to-severe allergic rhinitis: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"No evidence shows that one intranasal corticosteroid (INCS) is better than another for treating moderate-to-severe allergic rhinitis (AR). This network meta-analysis assessed the comparative efficacy and acceptability of licensed dose aqueous INCSs. PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched until 31 March 2022. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials comparing INCSs with placebo or other types of INCSs in patients with moderate-to-severe allergic rhinitis. Two reviewers independently screened and extracted data following the Preferred Reporting Items in Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis guideline. A random-effects model was used for data pooling. Continuous outcomes were expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD). The primary outcomes were the efficacy in improving total nasal symptom score (TNSS) and treatment acceptability (the study dropout). We included 26 studies, 13 with 5,134 seasonal AR patients and 13 with 4,393 perennial AR patients. Most placebo-controlled studies had a moderate quality of evidence. In seasonal AR, mometasone furoate (MF) was ranked the highest efficacy, followed by fluticasone furoate (FF), ciclesonide (CIC), fluticasone propionate and triamcinolone acetonide (TAA) (SMD -0.47, 95% CI: -0.63 to -0.31; -0.46, 95% CI: -0.59 to -0.33; -0.44, 95% CI: -0.75 to -0.13; -0.42, 95% CI: -0.67 to -0.17 and -0.41, 95% CI: -0.81 to -0.00), In perennial AR, budesonide was ranked the highest efficacy, followed by FF, TAA, CIC, and MF (SMD -0.43, 95% CI: -0.75 to -0.11; -0.36, 95% CI: -0.53 to -0.19; -0.32, 95% CI: -0.54 to -0.10; -0.29, 95% CI: -0.48 to -0.11; and -0.28, 95% CI: -0.55 to -0.01). The acceptability of all included INCSs was not inferior to the placebo. According to our indirect comparison, some INCSs have superior efficacy to others with moderate quality of evidence in most placebo-controlled studies for treating moderate-to-severe AR.","['acceptability', 'allergic rhinitis', 'efficacy', 'intranasal corticosteroid', 'metaanalysis', 'systematic review', 'total nasal symptom score', 'total ocular symptom score']"
Balneotherapy for Fibromyalgia Syndrome: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"(1) Background: The efficiency of balneotherapy (BT) for fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) remains elusive. (2) Methods: Cochrane Library, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PubMed, Clinicaltrials.gov, and PsycINFO were searched from inception to 31 May 2020. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with at least one indicator were included, i.e., pain, Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ), Tender Points Count (TPC), and Beck's Depression Index (BDI). The outcome was reported as a standardized mean difference (SMD), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), and <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> for heterogeneity at three observational time points. GRADE was used to evaluate the strength of evidence. (3) Results: Amongst 884 citations, 11 RCTs were included (<i>n</i> = 672). Various BT regimens were reported (water types, duration, temperature, and ingredients). BT can benefit FMS with statistically significant improvement at different time points (pain of two weeks, three and six months: SMD = -0.92, -0.45, -0.70; 95% CI (-1.31 to -0.53, -0.73 to -0.16, -1.34 to -0.05); <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 54%, 51%, 87%; GRADE: very low, moderate, low; FIQ: SMD = -1.04, -0.64, -0.94; 95% CI (-1.51 to -0.57, -0.95 to -0.33, -1.55 to -0.34); <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 76%, 62%, 85%; GRADE: low, low, very low; TPC at two weeks and three months: SMD = -0.94, -0.47; 95% CI (-1.69 to -0.18, -0.71 to -0.22); <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 81%, 0; GRADE: very low, moderate; BDI at six months: SMD = -0.45; 95% CI (-0.73 to -0.17); <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0; GRADE: moderate). There was no statistically significant effect for the TPC and BDI at the remaining time points (TPC at six months: SMD = -0.89; 95% CI (-1.85 to 0.07); <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 91%; GRADE: very low; BDI at two weeks and three months: SMD = -0.35, -0.23; 95% CI (-0.73 to 0.04, -0.64 to 0.17); <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 24%, 60%; GRADE: moderate, low). (4) Conclusions: Very low to moderate evidence indicates that BT can benefit FMS in pain and quality-of-life improvement, whereas tenderness and depression improvement varies at time phases. Established BT regimens with a large sample size and longer observation are needed.","['balneotherapy', 'fibromyalgia', 'metaanalysis', 'musculoskeletal disease', 'systematic review']"
Putative causal inference for the relationship between obesity and sex hormones in males: a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study.,"Obesity is a chronic disease with a high prevalence rate and is an established risk factor for human health. Body mass index (BMI) is a common and primary indicator used in assessing obesity. This work aims to investigate the putative causal relationship among BMI, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), bioavailable testosterone (BioT), and estradiol levels.We conducted a bidirectional Mendelian randomization study, using single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) strongly associated with BMI, SHBG, BioT, and estradiol as instrumental variables. All SNPs were identified from the genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary data of large sample studies recruiting more than 150,000 European adult male individuals. The inverse-variance-weighted (IVW) approach was used as a primary algorithm for putative causal estimation.Genetically predicted elevated BMI was associated with decreased SHBG (IVW, β = -0.103, 95% confidence interval [CI] [-0.113 to -0.092], <i>P</i> = 1.50 × 10<sup>-77</sup>) and BioT levels (IVW, β = -0.139, 95% CI [-0.165 to -0.113], <i>P</i> = 9.54 × 10<sup>-26</sup>) and high estradiol levels (IVW, β = 0.014, 95% CI [0.009-0.019], <i>P</i> = 2.19 × 10<sup>-7</sup>). Increased SHBG levels were causally associated with low BMI (IVW, β = -0.051, 95% CI [-0.098 to -0.005], <i>P</i> = 0.030) and BioT (IVW, β = -0.126, 95% CI [-0.175 to -0.077], <i>P</i> = 5.97 × 10<sup>-7</sup>) and high estradiol levels (IVW, β = 0.046, 95% CI [0.035-0.056], <i>P</i> = 6.51 × 10<sup>-17</sup>). Conversely, no evidence of an effect of estradiol imbalance on SHBG levels (IVW, β = 1.035, 95% CI [-0.854 to 2.926], <i>P</i> = 0.283) and BMI (IVW, β = 0.091, 95% CI [-0.094 to 0.276], <i>P</i> = 0.336) was obtained. However, increased BioT levels were causally associated with lower SHBG levels (IVW, β = -0.044, 95% CI [-0.061 to -0.026], <i>P</i> = 8.76 × 10<sup>-7</sup>), not BMI (IVW, β = -0.006, 95% CI [-0.035 to 0.023], <i>P</i> = 0.679).The findings support a network putative causal relationship among BMI, SHBG, BioT, and estradiol. SHBG, BioT, and estradiol may partly mediate the effect of obesity on male health. Reasonably modulating BioT and estradiol, especially SHBG, facilitated the attenuation of the harmful effects of obesity on male health.","['Bioavailable testosterone', 'Body mass index', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Sex hormonebinding globulin', 'Singlenucleotide polymorphism']"
Effect of exercise intervention on depression in children and adolescents: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"To evaluate the effect of different exercise interventions on depressive symptoms in children and adolescents.Randomized controlled trials (RCT) published until May 2023 were screened in four databases. The Cochrane collaboration tool was used to assess the risk of bias for quality evaluation. Stata 16.0 software was used for both a pairwise meta-analysis and a series of frequentist network meta-analyses (NMA).A total of 35 RCTs and 5393 participants were included. Aerobic exercise had the most significant effect on depressive symptoms (66.2%), followed by group training (62.5%), resistance exercise (59.0%), and aerobic combined with resistance exercise (57.9%). Furthermore, children and adolescents younger than 15 years showed significant improvement in depressive symptoms (SMD=-0.41, 95% CI (-0.63, -0.19), P < 0.01). The study also found a significant improvement in depression among healthy, obesity, and depressed populations (SMD=-0.25, 95% CI (-0.41, -0.08), P < 0.01); SMD=-0.15, 95% CI (-0.31, -0.00), P < 0.01; SMD=-0.75, 95% CI (-1.32, -0.19), P < 0.01). Additionally, 30 min of exercise had a significant effect (SMD=-0.14, 95% CI (-0,81, -0.01), P < 0.01), and 40-50 min of exercise had the best effect (SMD=-0.17, 95% CI (-0,33, -0.02), P < 0.01). Lastly, exercise frequency of three times per week was significant in children and adolescents (SMD=-0.42, 95% CI (-0,66, -0.18), P < 0.01).Exercise significantly improves depressive symptoms in children and adolescents, with aerobic exercise having the most significant effect. A 12-week, three-times-a-week, 40-50-minute exercise intervention was found to be more effective in younger children and adolescents.","['Child and adolescent', 'Depression', 'Exercise intervention', 'Network metaanalysis']"
"Single-leg disuse decreases skeletal muscle strength, size, and power in uninjured adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","We aimed to quantify declines from baseline in lower limb skeletal muscle size and strength of uninjured adults following single-leg disuse. We searched EMBASE, Medline, CINAHL, and CCRCT up to 30 January 2022. Studies were included in the systematic review if they (1) recruited uninjured participants; (2) were an original experimental study; (3) employed a single-leg disuse model; and (4) reported muscle strength, size, or power data following a period of single-leg disuse for at least one group without a countermeasure. Studies were excluded if they (1) did not meet all inclusion criteria; (2) were not in English; (3) reported previously published muscle strength, size, or power data; or (4) could not be sourced from two different libraries, repeated online searches, and the authors. We used the Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool to assess risk of bias. We then performed random-effects meta-analyses on studies reporting measures of leg extension strength and extensor size. Our search revealed 6548 studies, and 86 were included in our systematic review. Data from 35 and 20 studies were then included in the meta-analyses for measures of leg extensor strength and size, respectively (40 different studies). No meta-analysis for muscle power was performed due to insufficient homogenous data. Effect sizes (Hedges' g<sub>av</sub> ) with 95% confidence intervals for leg extensor strength were all durations = -0.80 [-0.92, -0.68] (n = 429 participants; n = 68 aged 40 years or older; n ≥ 78 females); ≤7 days of disuse = -0.57 [-0.75, -0.40] (n = 151); >7 days and ≤14 days = -0.93 [-1.12, -0.74] (n = 206); and >14 days = -0.95 [-1.20, -0.70] (n = 72). Effect sizes for measures of leg extensor size were all durations = -0.41 [-0.51, -0.31] (n = 233; n = 32 aged 40 years or older; n ≥ 42 females); ≤7 days = -0.26 [-0.36, -0.16] (n = 84); >7 days and ≤14 days = -0.49 [-0.67, -0.30] (n = 102); and >14 days = -0.52 [-0.74, -0.30] (n = 47). Decreases in leg extensor strength (cast: -0.94 [-1.30, -0.59] (n = 73); brace: -0.90 [-1.18, -0.63] (n = 106)) and size (cast: -0.61[-0.87, -0.35] (n = 41); brace: (-0.48 [-1.04, 0.07] (n = 41)) following 14 days of disuse did not differ for cast and brace disuse models. Single-leg disuse in adults resulted in a decline in leg extensor strength and size that reached a nadir beyond 14 days. Bracing and casting led to similar declines in leg extensor strength and size following 14 days of disuse. Studies including females and males and adults over 40 years of age are lacking.","['Atrophy', 'Immobilization', 'Muscle disuse', 'Singleleg disuse', 'Skeletal muscle', 'Unloading']"
Ursodeoxycholic Acid and S-adenosylmethionine for the Treatment of Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy: A Meta-analysis.,"An optimal therapeutic strategy has not yet been identified for the pharmacological treatment of intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) and S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) in the treatment of ICP, both individually and in combination.A meta-analysis of all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing UDCA, SAMe, and combination therapy was performed. We carried out a literature search using pubmed, embase, the cochrane register of controlled trials, and the science citation index of web of science. The maternal clinical and biochemical responses, including pruritus scores, total bilirubin, total bile acids, alanine aminotransferase, and aspartate transaminase, were evaluated. Safety assessments, including preterm delivery, cesarean section, and meconium-stained amniotic fluid, were also analyzed.Five RCTs including 311 patients were evaluated. In comparison to SAMe, UDCA significantly reduced the pruritus score (OR = -0.45, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.66 to -0.25, P < 0.0001) and improved the levels of total bile acids (TBAs; OR = -0.59, 95% CI: -0.99 to -0.30, P < 0.0001) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT; OR = -0.38, 95% CI: -0.66 to -0.09, P = 0.01). UDCA was associated with significantly lower preterm delivery rates than SAMe (RR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.32-0.72, P = 0.0004). Interestingly, combination therapy significantly reduced total bilirubin (TB; vs. SAMe, OR = -0.41, 95% CI, -0.74 to -0.08, P = 0.02), aspartate transaminase (AST; vs. UDCA, OR = -0.40, 95% CI, -0.74 to -0.06, P = 0.02), and the rate of preterm delivery (vs. SAMe, OR = 0.62, 95% CI, 0.42 - 0.91, P = 0.02), in comparison with either drug administered alone.UDCA decreased the pruritus score, TBA, and ALT levels more effectively than SAMe, reducing the rate of preterm delivery for ICP.","['Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy', 'SAdenosylmethionine', 'Ursodeoxycholic Acid']"
Telemedicine Curriculum in an Ophthalmology Residency Program.,"<b>Background</b>  The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the adoption of telemedicine in the field of ophthalmology. Despite the increasing utilization of telemedicine, there is a lack of formal training in ophthalmology residency programs to ensure ophthalmologists are prepared to conduct virtual eye exams. <b>Objective</b>  This article aims to assess the impact of an ophthalmic telemedicine curriculum on ophthalmology residents' self-reported knowledge acquisition in conducting telemedicine eye exams, perceived ability to diagnose, manage, and triage common eye diseases, and evaluate their attitudes toward the current and future use of teleophthalmology. <b>Methods</b>  This single-center study at Massachusetts Eye and Ear used a nonvalidated pre- and postcurriculum survey conducted during the 2020 to 2021 academic year among ophthalmology residents. Participants engaged in an ophthalmic telemedicine curriculum that consisted of interactive didactic lectures and electronic postdidactic assessments. <b>Results</b>  Twenty-four residents (100%) completed a precurriculum survey, while 23 of 24 (95.8%) residents completed both the telemedicine curriculum and a postcurriculum survey. On a five-point Likert scale, the median interquartile range (IQR) scores for confidence with setup/logistics, history taking, examination, documentation, and education increased from 2.5 (2.0-4.0) to 4.0 (3.5-4.5) ( <i>p</i>  = 0.001), 3.0 (3.0-4.0) to 5.0 (4.0-5.0) ( <i>p</i>  < 0.001), 2.0 (1.8-2.0) to 4.0 (3.5-4.0) ( <i>p</i>  < 0.001), 2.0 (1.0-2.0) to 4.0 (3.0-4.0) ( <i>p</i>  < 0.001), and 2.5 (2.0-3.0) to 4.0 (4.0-4.0) ( <i>p</i>  < 0.001), respectively. The median (IQR) scores for comfort with ethics/professionalism, disparities and conducting patient triage, diagnosis, and management increased from 2.0 (2.0-2.3) to 4.0 (3.0-4.0) ( <i>p</i>  < 0.001), 2.0 (2.0-2.0) to 3.0 (3.0-4.0) ( <i>p</i>  < 0.001) and 3.0 (2.0-3.0) to 4.0 (3.0-4.0) ( <i>p</i>  = 0.001), 2.0 (2.0-3.0) to 3.0 (3.0-4.0) ( <i>p</i>  < 0.001), and 3.0 (2.0-3.0) to 3.0 (3.0-4.0) ( <i>p</i>  = 0.008), respectively. <b>Conclusion</b>  The implementation of an ophthalmic telemedicine curriculum increased resident confidence and self-reported knowledge across all logistical and clinical components of virtual ophthalmic care. Formal telehealth curricula can address an unmet educational need of resident trainees in an era of rapid uptake and utilization of telehealth services.","['curriculum development', 'graduate medical education', 'ophthalmology', 'resident education', 'telemedicine']"
Specific alterations of gut microbiota in diabetic microvascular complications: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The role of gut microbiota in diabetes mellitus (DM) and its complications has been widely accepted. However, the alternation of gut microbiota in diabetic microvascular complications (DC) remains to be determined.Publications (till August 20<sup>th</sup>, 2022) on gut microbiota in patients with DC were retrieved from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane. Review Manager 5.3 was performed to estimate the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) and calculate alpha diversity indices and the relative abundance of gut microbiota between patients in DC v.s. DM and DC v.s. healthy controls (HC).We included 13 studies assessing 329 patients with DC, 232 DM patients without DC, and 241 HC. Compared to DM, patients with DC shared a significantly lower Simpson index (SMD = -0.59, 95% CI [-0.82, -0.36], p < 0.00001), but a higher ACE index (SMD = 0.42, 95% CI[0.11, 0.74], p = 0.009). Compared to HC, DC patients held a lower ACE index (SMD = -0.61, 95% CI[-1.20, -0.02], p = 0.04). The relative abundances of phylum Proteobacteria (SMD = 0.03, 95% CI[0.01, 0.04], p = 0.003, v.s. HC) and genus <i>Klebsiella</i> (SMD = 0.00, 95% CI[0.00, 0.00], p < 0.00001, v.s. HC) were enriched, accompanying with depleted abundances of phylum Firmicutes (SMD = -0.06, 95% CI[-0.11, -0.01], p = 0.02, v.s. HC), genera <i>Bifidobacterium</i> (SMD = -0.01, 95% CI[-0.02,-0.01], p < 0.0001, v.s. DM), <i>Faecalibacterium</i> (SMD = -0.01, 95% CI[-0.02, -0.00], p = 0.009, v.s. DM; SMD = -0.02, 95% CI[-0.02, -0.01], p < 0.00001, v.s. HC) and <i>Lactobacillus</i> (SMD = 0.00, 95% CI[-0.00, -0.00], p < 0.00001, v.s. HC) in DC.Gut microbiota perturbations with the depletion of alpha diversity and certain short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs)-producing bacteria were associated with the pathology of DC. Therefore, gut microbiota might serve as a promising approach for the diagnosis and treatment of DC. Further investigations are required to study the mechanisms by which gut dysbiosis acts on the onset and progression of DC.","['diabetic kidney disease DKD', 'diabetic microvascular complication', 'diabetic peripheral neuropathy DPN', 'diabetic retinopathy DR', 'gut microbiota GM']"
Subscapularis tendon tear classification and diagnosis: A systemic review and meta-analysis.,"In the current study, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis regarding the comparison of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the techniques in diagnosing SSC tendon tears. Also, we performed a systematic review of the classification of SSC tendon tears.English language, peer-reviewed journal publications from the first date available to March 2022 were extracted by searching PubMed and Web of Science databases. A forest plot was used to graphically show the results of pooled sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of different diagnostic modalities.There were six studies on using MRI to diagnose subscapularis tendon tears, five studies on MRI, four studies on clinical examination, one on ultrasonography, and one on CT arthrography. Pooled sensitivity values for MRI, MRA, clinical examination, ultrasonography, and CT arthrography were 0.71 (CI: 0.54; 0.87), 0.83 (0.77; 0.88), 0.49 (0.31; 0.67), 0.39 (0.29; 0.51), and 0.90 (0.72-0.97), respectively. The pooled specificity values for MRI, MRA, clinical examination, ultrasonography, and CT arthrography were 0.93 (CI: 0.89; 0.96), 0.86 (0.75; 0.93), 0.89 (0.73; 0.96), 0.93 (0.88; 0.96), and 0.90 (0.69; 0.98), respectively. The pooled diagnostic accuracy values for MRI, MRA, clinical examination, ultrasonography, and CT arthrography were 0.84 (CI: 0.80; 0.88), 0.85 (0.77; 0.90), 0.76 (0.66; 0.84), 0.76 (0.70; 0.81), and 0.90 (0.78; 0.96), respectively.According to our systematic review and meta-analysis, MR arthrography was the most accurate in diagnosing subscapularis tears. MR arthrography was the most sensitive, and MRI and ultrasonography were the most specific in detecting subscapularis tears.","['CT arthrography', 'MR arthrography', 'MRI', 'clinical examination', 'subscapularis tendon tear', 'ultrasonography']"
Phenotypic differences of atopic dermatitis stratified by age.,"Atopic dermatitis (AD) is common across all ages. Understanding heterogeneous age-related phenotypes may improve AD management.To determine age-related clinical phenotypes of AD.A prospective, dermatology practice-based study was performed (<i>n</i> = 380). AD severity was evaluated using questionnaires and full-body examination. Phenotypes were determined using latent class analysis.There were 23 (6.1%) pediatric patients (<18 years), 176 (46.3%) young adults (18-39 years), and 181 (47.6%) older adults (≥ 40 years). Both young and older adults experienced less AD on ankles (adjusted odds ratio [95% confidence interval]: 0.41 [0.19-0.90], 0.43 [0.20-0.94]), moderate-severe AD on flexures (0.47 [0.26-0.87], 0.30 [0.16-0.56]), pityriasis alba (0.24 [0.11-0.52], 0.07 [0.03-0.18]), oozing lesions (0.44 [0.25-0.79], 0.35 [0.20-0.63]), moderate-severe excoriations (0.49 [0.28-0.85], 0.44 [0.26-0.76]), and severe itch (adjusted β [95% confidence interval], -1.46 [-2.63 to -0.29]; -1.79 [-2.94 to -0.65]) compared with pediatric patients. Young adults experienced more AD around the eyes (2.92 [1.21-7.02]). Older adults experienced more AD on elbows (0.34 [0.19-0.64]), nipples (0.40 [0.16-0.99]), knees (0.27 [0.14-0.53]), keratosis pilaris (0.38 [0.15-0.98]), and lichenification (0.47 [0.22-0.98]). Four classes were identified for distribution of AD and associated signs.Distinct phenotypes exist by age with younger patients experiencing more AD signs and symptoms. Clinicians should consider them when managing AD.","['AD', 'atopic dermatitis', 'Atopic dermatitis', 'eczema', 'patientreported outcomes', 'physical activity', 'severity']"
Substitution of animal-based with plant-based foods on cardiometabolic health and all-cause mortality: a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective studies.,"There is growing evidence that substituting animal-based with plant-based foods is associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and all-cause mortality. Our aim was to summarize and evaluate the evidence for the substitution of any animal-based foods with plant-based foods on cardiometabolic health and all-cause mortality in a systematic review and meta-analysis.We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science to March 2023 for prospective studies investigating the substitution of animal-based with plant-based foods on CVD, T2D, and all-cause mortality. We calculated summary hazard ratios (SHRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) using random-effects meta-analyses. We assessed the certainty of evidence (CoE) using the GRADE approach.In total, 37 publications based on 24 cohorts were included. There was moderate CoE for a lower risk of CVD when substituting processed meat with nuts [SHR (95% CI): 0.73 (0.59, 0.91), n = 8 cohorts], legumes [0.77 (0.68, 0.87), n = 8], and whole grains [0.64 (0.54, 0.75), n = 7], as well as eggs with nuts [0.83 (0.78, 0.89), n = 8] and butter with olive oil [0.96 (0.95, 0.98), n = 3]. Furthermore, we found moderate CoE for an inverse association with T2D incidence when substituting red meat with whole grains/cereals [0.90 (0.84, 0.96), n = 6] and red meat or processed meat with nuts [0.92 (0.90, 0.94), n = 6 or 0.78 (0.69, 0.88), n = 6], as well as for replacing poultry with whole grains [0.87 (0.83, 0.90), n = 2] and eggs with nuts or whole grains [0.82 (0.79, 0.86), n = 2 or 0.79 (0.76, 0.83), n = 2]. Moreover, replacing red meat for nuts [0.93 (0.91, 0.95), n = 9] and whole grains [0.96 (0.95, 0.98), n = 3], processed meat with nuts [0.79 (0.71, 0.88), n = 9] and legumes [0.91 (0.85, 0.98), n = 9], dairy with nuts [0.94 (0.91, 0.97), n = 3], and eggs with nuts [0.85 (0.82, 0.89), n = 8] and legumes [0.90 (0.89, 0.91), n = 7] was associated with a reduced risk of all-cause mortality.Our findings indicate that a shift from animal-based (e.g., red and processed meat, eggs, dairy, poultry, butter) to plant-based (e.g., nuts, legumes, whole grains, olive oil) foods is beneficially associated with cardiometabolic health and all-cause mortality.","['Animalbased food', 'Cardiovascular disease', 'Diet', 'Mortality', 'Plantbased food', 'Substitution', 'Type 2 diabetes']"
Ergogenic effects of precooling with cold water immersion and ice ingestion: A meta-analysis.,"This review evaluated the effects of precooling via cold water immersion (CWI) and ingestion of ice slurry/slushy or crushed ice (ICE) on endurance performance measures (e.g. time-to-exhaustion and time trials) and psychophysiological parameters (core [T<sub>core</sub>] and skin [T<sub>skin</sub>] temperatures, whole body sweat [WBS] response, heart rate [HR], thermal sensation [TS], and perceived exertion [RPE]). Twenty-two studies were included in the meta-analysis based on the following criteria: (i) cooling was performed before exercise with ICE or CWI; (ii) exercise longer than 6 min was performed in ambient temperature ≥26°C; and (iii) crossover study design with a non-cooling passive control condition. CWI improved performance measures (weighted average effect size in Hedges' g [95% confidence interval] + 0.53 [0.28; 0.77]) and resulted in greater increase (ΔEX) in T<sub>skin</sub> (+4.15 [3.1; 5.21]) during exercise, while lower peak T<sub>core</sub> (-0.93 [-1.18; -0.67]), WBS (-0.74 [-1.18; -0.3]), and TS (-0.5 [-0.8; -0.19]) were observed without concomitant changes in ΔEX-T<sub>core</sub> (+0.19 [-0.22; 0.6]), peak T<sub>skin</sub> (-0.67 [-1.52; 0.18]), peak HR (-0.14 [-0.38; 0.11]), and RPE (-0.14 [-0.39; 0.12]). ICE had no clear effect on performance measures (+0.2 [-0.07; 0.46]) but resulted in greater ΔEX-T<sub>core</sub> (+1.02 [0.59; 1.45]) and ΔEX-T<sub>skin</sub> (+0.34 [0.02; 0.67]) without concomitant changes in peak T<sub>core</sub> (-0.1 [-0.48; 0.28]), peak T<sub>skin</sub> (+0.1 [-0.22; 0.41]), peak HR (+0.08 [-0.19; 0.35]), WBS (-0.12 [-0.42; 0.18]), TS (-0.2 [-0.49; 0.1]), and RPE (-0.01 [-0.33; 0.31]). From both ergogenic and thermoregulatory perspectives, CWI may be more effective than ICE as a precooling treatment prior to exercise in the heat.","['Cardiovascularcardiorespiratory', 'environmental physiology', 'exercise', 'fatigue', 'performance']"
The effects of physical activity on depression and quality of life in Chinese perimenopausal women.,"Women are more likely to experience depressive symptoms and poor quality of life (QoL) during perimenopause. The effectiveness of physical activity (PA) in perimenopause on mental well-being and health outcomes has been frequently reported. This study aimed to investigate the mediating effect of PA on the relationship between depression and QoL in Chinese perimenopausal women.A cross-sectional study was performed, and participants were recruited through a multistage, stratified, probability proportional to size sampling method. Depression, PA, and QoL were measured by Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, Physical Activity Rating Scale-3, and World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire. The direct and indirect effects of PA on QoL were analyzed by PA in a mediation framework.1100 perimenopausal women participated in the study. PA mainly plays partial mediating roles in the relationship between depression and physical (ab = -0.493, 95 % CI: -0.582 to -0.407; ab = -0.449, 95 % CI: -0.553 to -0.343) and psychological (ab = -0.710, 95 % CI: -0.849 to -0.578; ab = -0.721, 95 % CI: -0.853 to -0.589; ab = -0.670, 95 % CI: -0.821 to -0.508) domains of QoL. Additionally, intensity (ab = -0.496, 95 % CI: -0.602 to -0.396; ab = -0.355, 95 % CI: -0.498 to -0.212) and duration (ab = -0.201, 95 % CI: -0.298 to -0.119; ab = -0.134, 95 % CI: -0.237 to -0.047) intermediated the relationship between moderate-to-severe depression and physical domain; frequency (ab = -0.130, 95 % CI: -0.207 to -0.066) only had a mediation influence between moderate depression and physical domain; intensity (ab = -0.583, 95 % CI: -0.712 to -0.460; ab = -0.709, 95 % CI: -0.854 to -0.561; ab = -0.520, 95 % CI: -0.719 to -0.315), duration (ab = -0.433, 95 % CI: -0.559 to -0.311; ab = -0.389, 95 % CI: -0.547 to -0.228; ab = -0.258, 95 % CI: -0.461 to -0.085), and frequency (ab = -0.365, 95 % CI: -0.493 to -0.247; ab = -0.270, 95 % CI: -0.414 to -0.144) all interceded between the psychological domain and all levels of depression, except for the frequency between severe depression and psychological domain; in terms of social relationship and environment domains, intensity (ab = -0.458, 95 % CI: -0.593 to -0.338; ab = -0.582, 95 % CI: -0.724 to -0.445), duration (ab = -0.397, 95 % CI: -0.526 to -0.282; ab = -0.412, 95 % CI: -0.548 to -0.293), and frequency (ab = -0.231, 95 % CI: -0.353 to -0.123; ab = -0.398, 95 % CI: -0.533 to -0.279) were mediators only on mild depression.The cross-sectional study and self-reported data are major limiting factors.PA and its components partially mediated the association between depression and QoL. Suitable prevention methods and interventions for PA may improve the QoL for perimenopausal women.","['Depression', 'Mediation', 'Perimenopause', 'Physical activity', 'Quality of life']"
Genetic variation frequencies in Wilms' tumor: A meta-analysis and systematic review.,"Over the last few decades, numerous biomarkers in Wilms' tumor have been confirmed and shown variations in prevalence. Most of these studies were based on small sample sizes. We carried out a meta-analysis of the research published from 1992 to 2015 to obtain more precise and comprehensive outcomes for genetic tests. In the present study, 70 out of 5175 published reports were eligible for the meta-analysis, which was carried out using Stata 12.0 software. Pooled prevalence for gene mutations WT1, WTX, CTNNB1, TP53, MYCN, DROSHA, and DGCR8 was 0.141 (0.104, 0.178), 0.147 (0.110, 0.184), 0.140 (0.100, 0.190), 0.410 (0.214, 0.605), 0.071 (0.041, 0.100), 0.082 (0.048, 0.116), and 0.036 (0.026, 0.046), respectively. Pooled prevalence of loss of heterozygosity at 1p, 11p, 11q, 16q, and 22q was 0.109 (0.084, 0.133), 0.334 (0.295, 0.373), 0.199 (0.146, 0.252), 0.151 (0.129, 0.172), and 0.148 (0.108, 0.189), respectively. Pooled prevalence of 1q and chromosome 12 gain was 0.218 (0.161, 0.275) and 0.273 (0.195, 0.350), respectively. The limited prevalence of currently known genetic alterations in Wilms' tumors indicates that significant drivers of initiation and progression remain to be discovered. Subgroup analyses indicated that ethnicity may be one of the sources of heterogeneity. However, in meta-regression analyses, no study-level characteristics of indicators were found to be significant. In addition, the findings of our sensitivity analysis and possible publication bias remind us to interpret results with caution.","['Children', 'Wilms tumor', 'genetic variations', 'metaanalysis', 'prevalence']"
The relationship between cadmium and cognition in the elderly: a systematic review.,"<b>Context:</b> The relationship between cadmium (Cd) and the cognition of the elderly is indistinct.<b>Objective:</b> To summarise the studies on the relationship between the cognition of the elderly and Cd.<b>Methods:</b> Literatures were searched in PubMed, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wan fang database on April 25, 2022. The entries in the STROBE statement were used to evaluate the literature quality; all the quantitative studies that met the requirements were systematically summarised.<b>Results:</b> Blood Cd was negatively correlated with the cognitive ability of the elderly, corresponding to different cognitive ability assessment methods, the regression coefficients were: -0.11 (-0.20, -0.03), -0.46 (-0.71, -0.21), -0.54 (-0.90, -0.17), -0.19 (-0.37, -0.01), and -2.29 (-3.41, -1.16). The regression coefficients between urinary Cd level and cognition score were -1.42 (-2.38, -0.46), and 0.76 (-1.28, -0.23). When dietary Cd increased by 1 μg/kg, the composite z-score decreased by 3.64 (<i>p</i> = 0.001). There was no significant correlation between drinking water Cd, fingernail Cd and cognition (<i>p</i> > 0.05).<b>Conclusion:</b> We concluded that blood Cd (including whole blood and plasma), urine Cd and dietary Cd were negatively correlated with the cognition of the elderly, but the relationship between Cd in drinking water and fingernails and cognition was not statistically significant.","['Cadmium', 'cognition', 'elderly', 'systematic review']"
Association of serum lipids with inflammatory bowel disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Serum lipid levels seem to be abnormal in Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, the specific manifestation of abnormal serum lipid levels in IBD are heterogeneous among studies and have not been sufficiently determined yet.PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched. Serum lipid levels were compared between IBD patients and Health individuals, Crohn's (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), active and inactive, mild and non-mild patients, respectively. Meta-analyses were performed by using a random-effect model. Weight mean difference (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.Overall, 53 studies were included. Compared with healthy controls, IBD patients had significantly lower TC (WMD = -0.506, 95%CI = -0.674 to -0.338, <i>p</i> < 0.001), HDL-c (WMD = -0.122, 95%CI = -0.205 to -0.039, <i>p</i> = 0.004), and LDL-c (WMD = -0.371, 95%CI = -0.547 to -0.194, <i>p</i> < 0.001) levels. CD groups had a significantly lower TC (WMD = -0.349, 95%CI = -0.528 to -0.170, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) level as compared to UC groups. Active IBD and non-mild UC groups had significantly lower TC (WMD = -0.454, 95%CI = -0.722 to -0.187, <i>p</i> = 0.001) (WMD =0.462, 95%CI = 0.176 to 0.748, <i>p</i> = 0.002) and LDL-c (WMD = -0.225, 95%CI = -0.445 to -0.005, <i>p</i> = 0.045) (WMD =0.346, 95%CI = 0.084-0.609, <i>p</i> = 0.010) levels as compared to inactive IBD and mild UC groups, respectively.The overall level of serum lipids in IBD patients is lower than that of healthy individuals and is negatively associated with disease severity.https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier: CRD42022383885.","['Cronh’s disease', 'inflammatory bowel disease', 'metaanalysis', 'serum lipids', 'ulcerative disease']"
Long-term efficacy and adverse effects of cannabidiol in adjuvant treatment of drug-resistant epilepsy: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic brain diseases. Almost one-third of patients have drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE). Cannabidiol is being considered as a potential novel drug for treating DRE.To investigate long-term efficacy and safety of cannabidiol in treatment of DRE and the differences in cannabidiol treatment among patients with different characteristics.Systematic review and meta-analysis.Medline, Embase, and CENTRAL were searched for literature. RevMan5.4 was used for meta-analysis. The Intention-to-treat set and the random effect were used as the main analysis. Subgroup analyses were performed according to age, dose, concomitant antiseizure medications (ASMs), epilepsy syndromes, and study designs.Fifty studies were included in this systematic review. A total of 4791 participants were collected. The responder rates (seizure frequency reduced at least 50%) at 12-, 24-, 48-, 72-, 96-, and 144-week were 0.40 [0.36, 0.45], 0.39 [0.34, 0.44], 0.37 [0.30, 0.44], 0.27 [0.17, 0.37], 0.22 [0.14, 0.30], and 0.38 [0.23, 0.53]. Seizure-free rates were 0.04 [0.03, 0.06], 0.04 [0.03, 0.05], 0.03 [0.02, 0.05], 0.03 [0.02, 0.03], 0.02 [0.01, 0.03], and 0.04 [0.01, 0.06]. Proportion of adverse events were 0.72 [0.61, 0.83], 0.62 [0.42, 0.81], 0.60 [0.41, 0.79], 0.35 [0.14, 0.56], 0.83 [0.75, 0.90], and 0.96 [0.94, 0.99]. The pooled 12-, 24-, 48-, 96-, and 144-week proportion of serious adverse events were 0.15 [0.09, 0.21], 0.23 [0.14, 0.31], 0.10 [0.06, 0.15], 0.31 [0.24, 0.38], and 0.40 [0.35, 0.45]. Subgroup analyses showed that there was no significant difference on efficacy and safety among age subgroups and epilepsy syndromes subgroups. For most periods, there were no significant difference on efficacy among subgroups of dose and concomitant ASMs. However, higher doses and more concomitant ASMs were associated with higher proportion of adverse events.Cannabidiol treatment of DRE has stable efficacy and fewer adverse events in early period. Long-term use may have decreased efficacy and increased adverse events. Dose escalation may not increase efficacy, but may increase adverse events. Furthermore, cannabidiol use may reduce dosage of other ASMs without reducing efficacy, thereby reducing adverse effects. Cannabidiol may have similar effects in various epilepsy syndromes.PROSPERO (CRD42022351250).","['antiseizure medications', 'drug combination', 'intractable epilepsy', 'marijuana']"
Effects of vitamin D supplementation on the regulation of blood lipid levels in prediabetic subjects: A meta-analysis.,"This meta-analysis aimed to systematically investigate whether vitamin D supplementation reduces blood lipid-total cholesterol (TC), LDL cholesterol (LDL-C), HDL cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglyceride (TG)-levels in prediabetic individuals. Pubmed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, CNKI, and WANFANG databases were searched for studies published before 13 February 2022 (including 13 February 2022). Five articles were included. The results showed that vitamin D intervention led to a significant reduction in TG compared with control or placebo treatment (-0.42 [-0.59, -0.25], <i>P</i> < 0.001). Subgroup analyses showed that this effect was particularly significant among the studies that included obese subjects (-0.46 [-0.65, -0.28], <i>P</i> < 0.001), the studies that also included men (not only women) (-0.56 [-0.78, -0.34], <i>P</i> < 0.001), and the studies with intervention durations longer than 1 year (-0.46 [-0.65, -0.28], <i>P</i> < 0.001). Both relatively low doses of 2,857 IU/day (-0.65 [-0.92, -0.38], <i>P</i> < 0.001) and relatively high doses of 8,571 IU/day (-0.28 [-0.54, -0.02] <i>P</i> = 0.04) of vitamin D supplementation reduced TG levels, and the effect was observed both in Northern Europe (-0.65 [-0.92, -0.38], <i>P</i> < 0.001) and Asian (-0.25 [-0.48, -0.03], <i>P</i> = 0.03) country subgroups. No significant effects on TC, HDL-C, and LDL-C were shown. In conclusion, vitamin D supplementation might beneficially affect TG levels in individuals with prediabetes. Particularly longer durations of treatment, more than 1 year, with doses that correct vitamin deficiency/insufficiency, can have a beneficial effect.

New evidence for the effect of type 2 diabetes and glycemic traits on testosterone levels: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is an endocrine-related disease with an increasing incidence worldwide. Male sexual dysfunction is common in diabetic patients. Therefore, we designed a Mendelian randomization (MR) study to investigate the association of type 2 diabetes and 3 glycemic traits with testosterone levels.Uncorrelated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with T2DM (N = 228), fasting insulin (N = 38), fasting glucose (N = 71), and HbA1c (N = 75) at the genome-wide significance were selected as instrument variables. Genetic associations with testosterone levels (total testosterone, TT, bioavailable testosterone, BT, and sex hormone-binding globulin, SHBG) were obtained from the UK Biobank studies and other large consortia. Two-sample MR analysis was used to minimize the bias caused by confounding factors and response causality. Multivariable MR analysis was performed using Body mass index (BMI), Triglycerides (TG), LDL cholesterol (LDL), and adiponectin to adjust for the effects of potential confounders.Type 2 diabetes mellitus was associated with the decrease of total testosterone (β: -0.021,95%CI: -0.032, -0.010, p<0.001) and sex hormone binding globulin (β: -0.048,95%CI: -0.065, -0.031, p<0.001). In males, total testosterone (β: 0.058, 95% CI: 0.088, 0.028, p < 0.001) decreased. In females, it was associated with an increase in bioavailable testosterone (β: 0.077,95%CI: 0.058,0.096, p<0.001). Each unit (pmol/L) increase in fasting insulin was associated with 0.283nmol/L decrease in sex hormone-binding globulin (95%CI: -0.464, -0.102, p=0.002) and 0.260nmol/L increase in bioavailable testosterone (95%CI: -0.464, -0.102, p= 0.002). In males, sex hormone binding globulin decreased by 0.507nmol/L (95%CI: -0.960, -0.054, p= 0.028) and bioavailable testosterone increased by 0.216nmol/L (95%CI: 0.087,0.344, p= 0.001). In females, sex hormone binding globulin decreased by 0.714 nmol/L (95%CI: -1.093, -0.335, p<0.001) and bioavailable testosterone increased by 0.467nmol/L (95%CI: 0.286,0.648, p<0.001). Each unit (%) increase in HbA1c was associated with 0.060nmol/L decrease in sex hormone-binding globulin (95%CI: -0.113, -0.007, p= 0.026). In males, total testosterone decreased by 0.171nmol/L (95%CI: -0.288, -0.053, p=0.005) and sex hormone binding globulin decreased by 0.206nmol/L (95%CI: -0.340, -0.072, p=0.003). Total testosterone increased by 0.122nmol/L (95%CI: 0.012,0.233, p=0.029) and bioavailable testosterone increased by 0.163nmol/L (95%CI: 0.042,0.285, p=0.008) in females.Using MR Analysis, we found independent effects of type 2 diabetes, fasting insulin, and HbA1c on total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin after maximum exclusion of the effects of obesity, BMI, TG, LDL and Adiponectin.","['Mendelian randomization', 'diabetes', 'glycemic traits', 'sexual dysfunction', 'testosterone']"
Lipid profiles in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a systematic literature review and meta-analysis.,"The purpose of this study was to comprehensively evaluate the lipid profiles in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA).The literature and relevant reviews were searched for published clinical studies on the relationship between JIA and blood lipid levels. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale (NOS) was applied to evaluate the risk and methodological value of the included case‒control and cohort studies. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals were derived for all variables with adequate unprocessed data. This meta-analysis followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines.In total, 16 studies were incorporated through screening. The analysis findings revealed that the levels of very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [SMD=-0.411, 95% CI (-0.774~-0.048), P = 0.026], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [SMD=-0.528, 95% CI (-0.976~-0.079), P = 0.021], and apolipoprotein A1 [SMD=-1.050, 95% CI (-1.452~-0.647), P = 0.000] in JIA patients were statistically lower than those observed in healthy controls. The level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [SMD = 0.202, 95% CI (0.003 ~ 0.400), P = 0.046] was significantly higher in JIA patients than in healthy controls. In JIA patients, body mass index [SMD=-0.189, 95% CI (-0.690 ~ 0.311), P = 0.459], high-density lipoprotein [SMD =-1.235, 95% CI (-2.845 ~ 0.374), P = 0.133), low-density lipoprotein [SMD = 0.616, 95% CI (-0.813 ~ 2.046), P = 0.398), triglycerides (SMD = 0.278, 95% CI (-0.182 ~ 0.738), P = 0.236], total cholesterol [SMD=-0.073, 95% CI (-0.438 ~ 0.293), P = 0.696] and apolipoprotein B levels [SMD = 0.226, 95% CI (-0.133 ~ 0.585), P = 0.217] were not significantly different from those in healthy controls.The outcomes of this meta-analysis suggest that dyslipidemia is common in JIA patients compared to healthy controls. Patients with JIA have a significantly increased risk of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease later in life.","['Juvenile idiopathic arthritis', 'Lipid profile', 'Metaanalysis', 'Rheumatology']"
Effectiveness of 0.01% atropine in anisomyopic children.,"To investigate the change in ocular parameters of anisomyopic children treated with 0.01% atropine.This retrospective study analyzed the data of anisomyopic children who underwent comprehensive examination at a tertiary eye center in India. Anisomyopic subjects (difference of ≥1.00 D) of age 6-12 years who were treated with 0.01% atropine or prescribed regular single vision spectacle and had follow-ups of more than 1 year were included.Data from 52 subjects were included. No difference was observed in the mean rate of change of spherical equivalent (SE) of more myopic eyes between 0.01% atropine (-0.56 D; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.82, -0.30) and single vision lens wearers (-0.59 D; 95% CI: -0.80, -0.37; P = 0.88). Similarly, insignificant change in the mean SE of less myopic eyes was noted between the groups (0.01% atropine group, -0.62 D; 95% CI: -0.88, -0.36 vs. single vision spectacle wearer group, -0.76 D; 95% CI: -1.00, -0.52; P = 0.43). None of the ocular biometric parameters showed any difference between the two groups. Though anisomyopic cohort treated with 0.01% atropine revealed a significant correlation between the rate of change of mean SE and axial length in both eyes (more myopic eyes, r = -0.58; P = 0.001 and less myopic eyes, r = -0.82; P < 0.001) compared to single vision spectacle wearer group, the change was not significant.Administration of 0.01% atropine had minimal effect on reducing the rate of myopia progression in anisomyopic eyes.","['001 atropine', 'anisomyopia', 'axial length', 'myopia', 'spherical equivalent']"
Gut microbiota changes in patients with hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Hypertension is a major public health issue worldwide. The imbalance of gut microbiota is thought to play an important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. The authors conducted the systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the relationship between gut microbiota and hypertension through conducting an electronic search in six databases. Our meta-analysis included 19 studies and the results showed that compared with healthy controls, Shannon significantly decreased in hypertension [SMD = -0.13, 95%CI (-0.22, -0.04), p = .007]; however, Simpson [SMD = -0.01, 95%CI (-0.14, 0.12), p = .87], ACE [SMD = 0.18, 95%CI (-0.06, 0.43), p = .14], and Chao1 [SMD = 0.11, 95%CI (-0.01, 0.23), p = .08] did not differ significantly between hypertension and healthy controls. The F/B ratio significantly increased in hypertension [SMD = 0.84, 95%CI (0.10, 1.58), p = .03]. In addition, Shannon index was negatively correlated with hypertension [r = -0.12, 95%CI (-0.19, -0.05)], but had no significant correlation with SBP [r = 0.10, 95%CI (-0.19, 0.37)] and DBP [r = -0.39, 95%CI (-0.73, 0.12)]. At the phylum level, the relative abundance of Firmicutes [SMD = -0.01, 95%CI (-0.37, 0.34), p = .94], Bacteroidetes [SMD = -0.15, 95%CI (-0.44, 0.14), p = .30], Proteobacteria [SMD = 0.25, 95%CI (-0.01, 0.51), p = .06], and Actinobacteria [SMD = 0.21, 95%CI (-0.11, 0.53), p = .21] did not differ significantly between hypertension and healthy controls. At the genus level, compared with healthy controls, the relative abundance of Faecalibacterium decreased significantly [SMD = -0.16, 95%CI (-0.28, -0.04), p = .01], while the Streptococcus [SMD = 0.20, 95%CI (0.08, 0.32), p = .001] and Enterococcus [SMD = 0.20, 95%CI (0.08, 0.33), p = .002] significantly increased in hypertension. Available evidence suggests that hypertensive patients may have an imbalance of gut microbiota. However, it still needs further validation by large sample size studies of high quality.","['gut microbiota', 'high throughput sequencing', 'hypertension', 'metaanalysis', 'systematic review']"
Accelerometer Calibration: The Importance of Considering Functionality.,"To compare the accuracy and precision of a hip-worn accelerometer to predict energy cost during structured activities across motor performance and disease conditions.118 adults self-identifying as healthy (<i>n</i> = 44) and those with arthritis (<i>n</i> = 23), multiple sclerosis (<i>n</i> = 18), Parkinson's disease (<i>n</i> = 17), and stroke (<i>n</i> =18) underwent measures of motor performance and were categorized into groups: Group 1, usual; Group 2, moderate impairment; and Group 3, severe impairment. The participants completed structured activities while wearing an accelerometer and a portable metabolic measurement system. Accelerometer-predicted energy cost (metabolic equivalent of tasks [METs]) were compared with measured METs and evaluated across functional impairment and disease conditions. Statistical significance was assessed using linear mixed effect models and Bayesian information criteria to assess model fit.All activities' accelerometer counts per minute (CPM) were 29.5-72.6% less for those with disease compared with those who were healthy. The predicted MET bias was similar across disease, -0.49 (-0.71, -0.27) for arthritis, -0.38 (-0.53, -0.22) for healthy, -0.44 (-0.68, -0.20) for MS, -0.34 (-0.58, -0.09) for Parkinson's, and -0.30 (-0.54, -0.06) for stroke. For functional impairment, there was a graded reduction in CPM for all activities: Group 1, 1,215 CPM (1,129, 1,301); Group 2, 789 CPM (695, 884); and Group 3, 343 CPM (220, 466). The predicted MET bias revealed similar results across the Group 1, -0.37 METs (-0.52, -0.23); Group 2, -0.44 METs (-0.60, -0.28); and Group 3, -0.33 METs (-0.55, -0.13). The Bayesian information criteria showed a better model fit for functional impairment compared with disease condition.Using functionality to improve accelerometer calibration could decrease variability and warrants further exploration to improve accelerometer prediction of physical activity.","['impaired function', 'impairment', 'motion sensor', 'movement sensor', 'wearable']"
Effects of resistance training on insulin sensitivity in the elderly: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of resistance training in older adults on insulin sensitivity.Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, Web of Science and EBSCO were searched from inception to April 2021. We integrated randomized controlled trials published in English, and participants were non-athletic and aged ≥60 years. The outcome of interest was the change in insulin sensitivity, derived from the homeostatic model of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c).12 RCTs were included in this meta-analysis comparing resistance training (n = 232) with control (n = 209). Resistance exercise significantly reduced HOMA-IR level (d = -0.25, 95% CI, -0.43 to -0.06; P < 0.05) and HbA1c levels of (d = -0.51, 95% CI, -0.84 to -0.18; P < 0.05). Subgroup analysis of HOMA-IR revealed that the variables ""population"", ""training intensity"" and ""period"" had significant effects on HOMA-IR, with the largest effect sizes for high-intensity (d = -0.43, 95%CI, -0.85 to -0.22, P < 0.05) and long-term (more than 12 weeks) (d = -0.43, 95%CI, -0.85 to -0.22, P < 0.05) training programs in older adults without type 2 diabetes (T2D) (d = -0.23, 95%CI, -0.42 to -0.04, P < 0.05). Subgroup analysis of HbA1c suggested that resistance training programs with moderate intensity (d = -0.51, 95%CI, -0.90 to -0.12, P < 0.05) and short term (less than or equal to 12 weeks) (d = -0.49, 95%CI, -0.84 to -0.14, P < 0.05) have greater effects on HbA1c.The findings of this meta-analysis suggest that resistance training is effective for inducing improvement in insulin sensitivity for elderly. Subgroup analysis showed that high intensity and long period of resistance exercise improve HOMA-IR in healthy old adults, and that resistance training with moderate intensity and short period improve HbA1c in T2D old people. More studies with high methodological qualities and large sample sizes need to be done to further confirm our conclusion.","['Insulin sensitivity', 'Older adults', 'Resistance training']"
The effect of forming implementation intentions on alcohol consumption: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Meta-analysis was used to estimate the effect of forming implementation intentions (i.e., if-then plans) on weekly alcohol consumption and heavy episodic drinking (HED). Sample type, mode of delivery, intervention format and timeframe were tested as moderator variables.Cochrane, EThOS, Google Scholar, PsychArticles, PubMed and Web of Science were searched for relevant publications to 31 March 2021. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the effect size difference (d) between individuals forming versus not forming implementation intentions on weekly consumption and HED.Sixteen studies were included in meta-analyses. The effect size difference for forming implementation intentions on weekly alcohol consumption was d<sub>+</sub>  = -0.14 confidence interval (CI) [-0.24; -0.03]. Moderator analyses highlighted stronger effects for: (i) community (d<sub>+</sub>  = -0.38, CI [-0.58; -0.18]) versus university (d<sub>+</sub>  = -0.04, CI [-0.13; 0.05]) samples; (ii) paper (d<sub>+</sub>  = -0.26, CI [-0.43; -0.09]) versus online (d<sub>+</sub>  = -0.04, CI [-0.14; 0.06]) mode of delivery; and (iii) volitional help sheet (d<sub>+</sub>  = -0.34, CI [-0.60; -0.07]) versus implementation intention format (d<sub>+</sub>  = -0.07, CI [-0.16; 0.02]). In addition, effects diminished over time (B = 0.02, SE = 0.01, CI [0.03; 0.01]). Forming implementation intentions had a null effect on HED, d<sub>+</sub>  = -0.01 CI [-0.10; 0.08].Forming implementation intentions reduces weekly consumption but has no effect on HED.This review identifies boundary conditions on the effectiveness of implementation intentions to reduce alcohol consumption. Future research should focus on increasing the effectiveness of online-delivered interventions and integrating implementation intention and motivational interventions.","['alcohol', 'heavy episodic drinking', 'ifthen plans', 'implementation intentions', 'volitional help sheet']"
Diagnostic Accuracy of Circular RNAs in Different Types of Samples for Detecting Hepatocellular Carcinoma: A Meta-Analysis.,"The lack of accurate biomarkers impeded the screening, diagnosis and early treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). As a result of the development of high-throughput transcriptome analysis techniques, circular RNAs, a newly discovered class of noncoding RNAs, were recognized as potential novel biomarkers. This meta-analysis was performed to update the diagnostic roles of circular RNAs for HCC. We acquired 23 articles from PubMed, Web of Science, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases up to September 2021. The overall sensitivity was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.77-0.84), and the specificity was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.79-0.85), with an AUC of 0.88 (0.85-0.91). Considering of the significant heterogeneity, studies were divided into four groups based on the control types. The circular RNAs in exosomes had a sensitivity of 0.69 (95% CI: 0.61-0.75), and a highest specificity of 0.91 (95% CI: 0.83-0.96). The pooled sensitivity of circular RNAs in serum/plasma was 0.84 (95% CI: 0.81-0.87), and the pooled specificity was 0.83 (95% CI: 0.79-0.86). The pooled sensitivity of circular RNAs distinguishing tumor tissue from chronic hepatitis/cirrhosis tissues was 0.56 (95% CI: 0.48-0.64), and specificity was 0.76 (95% CI: 0.67-0.82). When the controls were adjacent tissues, the sensitivity was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.70-0.84), and the specificity was 0.78 (95% CI: 0.71-0.85). Hsa_circ_0001445 with a pooled sensitivity of 0.81, a specificity of 0.76 and an AUC of 0.85 in two studies, might be a suitable diagnostic blood biomarker for HCC. Relying on function in HCC, the AUC of subgroups were 0.88 (95%CI: 0.84-0.90) (function group) and 0.87 (95%CI: 0.84-0.90) (unknown function group). As for only reported in HCC or not, these circular RNAs had an AUC of 0.89 (95%CI: 0.86-0.91) (only in HCC) and 0.85 (95%CI: 0.82-0.88) (not only in HCC). In conclusion, the results suggested that circular RNAs were acceptable biomarkers for detecting HCC, especially those circular RNAs existing in exosomes or serum/plasma.","['circular RNAs', 'diagnosis', 'exosome', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'metaanalysis', 'serumplasma']"
Myopia Control With Multifocal Lens in School-Aged Children: A Meta-Analysis.,"Myopia is one of the most common eye diseases in school-aged children. Multifocal lens (MFL) is one of the interventions that has being widely applied to control the progress of myopia. However, the treatment effects of MFLs in school-aged children require to be systematically evaluated.A systematic analysis on qualified randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which MFLs were prescribed as the intervention and single-vision lenses (SVLs) as the control was conducted. The treatment effects referring to the mean differences in spherical equivalent refraction (SER) and axial length (AL) between MFLs and SVLs groups were analyzed.With annual visit (3-years follow-up), the weighted mean differences (WMDs) in SER between MFLs and SVLs were 0.29 D (95% CI, 0.21 ∼ 0.37, <i>p</i> < 0.00001), 0.46 D (95% CI, 0.32 ∼ 0.60, <i>p</i> < 0.00001), and 0.64 D (95% CI, 0.40 ∼ 0.88, <i>p</i> < 0.00001) at the first, second, and third year; in AL were -0.12 mm (95% CI, -0.14 ∼-0.11, <i>p</i> < 0.00001), -0.19 mm (95% CI, -0.22 ∼-0.16, <i>p</i> < 0.00001), and -0.26 mm (95% CI, -0.31 ∼-0.21, <i>p</i> < 0.00001) at the first, second, and third year. With 6-months interval trials (2-years follow-up), the WMDs in SER from MFLs were 0.14 D (95% CI, 0.08 ∼ 0.20, <i>p</i> < 0.0001), 0.19 D (95% CI, 0.11 ∼ 0.28, <i>p</i> < 0.0001), 0.24 D (95% CI, 0.16 ∼ 0.33, <i>p</i> < 0.0001), 0.31 D (95% CI, 0.18 ∼ 0.44, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and in AL from MFLs were -0.08 mm (95% CI, -0.09 ∼-0.07, <i>p</i> < 0.00001), -0.10 mm (95% CI, -0.12 ∼-0.09, <i>p</i> < 0.00001), -0.14 mm (95% CI, -0.17 ∼-0.11, <i>p</i> < 0.00001), and -0.18 mm (95% CI, -0.22 ∼-0.14, <i>p</i> < 0.00001) slower comparing with SVLs at follow up of 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively.The treatment effects of MFLs to slow down the myopic progress are positive in both 6-months and annual-visit trials and which could be sustained till 36 months. While a slight weaker treatment effect was observed after the first visit in 6-months visit, a slight rebound was observed at the following visit points. Furthermore, the treatment effects in annual visit are more profound than 6-months visit at almost all stages especially in SER. Our analysis encourages the MFLs users to maintain a long-term treatment with annual visit.","['bifocal lens', 'children', 'metaanalysis', 'multifocal lens', 'myopia control', 'peripheral additional lens']"
Effects of Taijiquan and Qigong exercises on depression and anxiety levels in patients with substance use disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Previous studies have shown that Taijiquan and Qigong exercise can effectively reduce depression and anxiety in healthy and clinical populations. At present, only a few reviews have elaborated on the premise of different types of interventions, and there is still a lack of studies that systematically summarize the clinical evidence of patients with substance use disorders. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to assess the impact of the Taijiquan and Qigong exercise on the mood of individuals with substance use disorders (SUD); Articles were searched in Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and CNKI from their inception to the May 24, 2021. All randomized controlled trials (RCT) using Taijiquan and Qigong intervention were included. With the Review Manager software to determine the effect (standardized mean difference, SMD), subgroup analysis was conducted to intervention type, exercise time, and exercise duration. Nine studies totaling 823 participants were included in the study. Overall results indicated that Taijiquan and Qigong exercise had significant benefits in reducing depression (<i>SMD</i> = -0.35, 95% <i>CI</i>: -0.53 to -0.18, <i>Z</i> = 4.00, <i>p</i> < 0.01) and anxiety (<i>SMD</i> = -0.31, 95% <i>CI</i>: -0.50 to -0.11, <i>Z</i> = 3.06, <i>p</i> < 0.01) symptoms in SUD. When depression and anxiety were examined separately, subgroup analysis demonstrated that Taijiquan intervention (<i>SMD</i> = -0.45, 95% <i>CI</i>: -0.71 to -0.19, <i>Z</i> = 3.39, <i>p</i> < 0.01) and Qigong intervention (<i>SMD</i> = -0.28, 95% <i>CI</i> -0.51 to -0.04, <i>Z</i> = 2.33, <i>p</i> = 0.02),30-60 min exercise time (<i>SMD</i> = -0.41, 95% <i>CI</i>: -0.61 to -0.20, <i>Z</i> = 3.82, <i>p</i> < 0.01) and duration of 9-12 weeks (<i>SMD</i> = -0.57, 95% <i>CI</i>: -1.10 to -0.04, <i>Z</i> = 2.10, <i>p</i> = 0.04) more than 12 weeks (<i>SMD</i> = -0.28, 95% <i>CI</i>: -0.50 to -0.07, <i>Z</i> = 2.59, <i>p</i> = 0.01) could effectively alleviate the symptoms of depression. Meanwhile, Qigong intervention (<i>SMD</i> = -0.31, 95% <i>CI</i>: -0.52 to -0.10, <i>Z</i> = 2.85, <i>p</i> < 0.01), 30-60 min exercise time (<i>SMD</i> = -0.29, 95% <i>CI</i>: -0.53 to -0.04, <i>Z</i> = 2.28, <i>p</i> = 0.02), more than 60 min exercise time (<i>SMD</i> = -0.54, 95% <i>CI</i>: -1.06 to -0.02, <i>Z</i> = 2.05, <i>p</i> = 0.04), and duration of less than 9 weeks (<i>SMD</i> = -0.35, 95% <i>CI</i>: -0.68 to -0.02, <i>Z</i> = 2.07, <i>p</i> = 0.04) had positive effects on alleviating anxiety symptoms with SUD.

"Association Between Atopic Dermatitis, Asthma, and Serum Lipids: A UK Biobank Based Observational Study and Mendelian Randomization Analysis.","Both atopic diseases and dysregulation of serum lipids (SLs) add to significant health burden, but evidences about their association are inconsistent.This work is to evaluate the association between asthma/atopic dermatitis (AD) and SLs and investigate the potential causal relationship.A large-scale cross-sectional study based on the UK Biobank (UKB) and then examined the casual relationships between SLs with asthma/AD based on a Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.A total of 502,505 participants were included in analysis. After full adjustment, AD was associated with lower TG (β = -0.006; 95%CI, -0.010 to -0.002; <i>P</i> = 0.006), lower LDL (β = -0.004; 95%CI, -0.006 to -0.002, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and lower TC (β = -0.004; 95%CI, -0.005 to -0.002; <i>P</i> < 0.001) but insignificantly correlated to HDL (<i>P</i> = 0.794). Asthma was also inversely correlated to TG (β = -0.005; 95%CI, = -0.007 to -0.003; < 0.001), LDL (β = -0.003; 95%CI, -0.004 to -0.002; <i>P</i> < 0.001), and TC (β = -0.002; 95%CI, -0.003 to -0.002; <i>P</i> < 0.001), but was positively correlated to HDL (β = 0.004; 95%CI, 0.003 to 0.005; <i>P</i> < 0.001), respectively. In subsequent MR analysis, both allergic diseases and asthma showed a protective effect on TC. Allergic diseases, asthma, and AD all showed a negative effect on LDL.Collectively, we identify a protective causal effect of allergic diseases on serum lipids, as well as a potentially positive association of HDL with asthma. Owing to the largest sample size and the application of IVs in causal inference, this study will provide a robust evidence for the management of asthma and AD and the prevention of dyslipidemia.","['Mendelian randomization', 'UK biobank', 'asthma', 'atopic dermatitis', 'serum lipids']"
Bone Health in Patients With Hematopoietic Disorders of Bone Marrow Origin: Systematic Review and Meta- Analysis.,"Blood cell production and bone homeostasis are physically interlinked systems that exhibit active cross-talk. We examined how bone health is affected in patients with hematopoietic disorders due to abnormal proliferation of bone marrow cells. The electronic databases Medline, Embase, PubMed, BIOSIS Previews, Web of Science, and Cochrane were searched for studies presenting numerical values for trabecular bone volume or bone mineral density in control and patients with hematopoietic disorders. We identified 5 studies for beta-thalassemia, 6 for sickle cell anemia, 2 for polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia, 3 for chronic myelogenous leukemia, 6 for myelofibrosis, 5 for multiple myeloma, and 4 studies each for systemic mastocytosis, lymphocytic leukemia, and hemochromatosis. The effect of the disease state on bone density was significant and negative for beta-thalassemia (r = -2.00; 95% confidence interval [CI] -3.41, -0.58; p < 0.005), sickle cell anemia (-0.91; -1.36, -0.47; p < 0.00005), chronic myelogenous leukemia (-0.55; -0.88, -0.22; p < 0005), mastocytosis (-0.99; -1.16, -0.82; p < 0.00001), lymphoblastic leukemia (-0.69; -0.98, -0.40; p < 0.00001), multiple myeloma (-0.67; -0.99, -0.35; p < 0.00005), and hemochromatosis (-1.15; -1.64, -0.66; p < 0.00001). The changes were negative but not significant for polycythemia vera (-0.16; -0.38, 0.05; p = 0.069) and essential thrombocythemia (-0.33; -0.92, 0.26; p = 0.14). In myelofibrosis, disease state was associated with increased bone density (0.74; 0.12, 1.36; p < 0.05). Bone density change significantly and negatively correlated with the level of ferritin and bone marrow cellularity but not with hemoglobin or erythropoietin. Thus, independent of hematopoietic lineage, abnormal proliferation of bone marrow cells appears to be associated with bone loss. Iron metabolism may independently contribute to bone homeostasis. © 2016 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.","['ANALYSISQUANTIFICATION OF BONE', 'BONE MARROW', 'CHRONIC MYELOPROLIFERATIVE DISORDERS', 'HEMOLYTIC ANEMIAS', 'TUMORINDUCED BONE DISEASE']"
Antimicrobial defined daily dose in neonatal population.,"Antimicrobial defined daily dose (DDD), a standardized metric to assess antimicrobial consumption in adult population, has limitations hampering its use in neonatal patients. This study proposes an alternative DDD design applicable for neonates.Neonates (<1 month-old) from 6 Spanish hospitals during a 12-months period were included. Weight and weeks gestational age of each neonate were the variables collected. DDD (g) for each antimicrobial was calculated by multiplying the obtained weight times the recommended dose (mg/kg) of the antimicrobial for the most common infectious indication selected by the Delphi method.A total of 4820 neonates were included. Mean age was 36.72 weeks of gestational age and Mean weight was 2.687kg. Standardized DDD (intravenous; oral route) for representative antimicrobials were: Amoxicillin (0.08; 0.08), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (0.27; 0.08), ampicillin (0.27; x), cloxacillin (0.13; 0.13), penicillin G sodium (0.12), cefazolin (0.13), cefuroxime (0.27; x), cefotaxime (0.27), ceftazidime (0.27), ceftriaxone (0.13), cefepime (0.27) piperacillin-tazobactam (0.54), aztreonam (0.24), azithromycin (0.03; 0.03), clindamycin (0.04; 0.04), amikacin (0.04), gentamicin (0.01), metronidazole (0.04; 0.08), ciprofloxacin (0.04; 0.05), levofloxacin (x;x), fluconazole (0.02; 0.02), itraconazole (0.01; 0.01), fosfomycin (0.27). Restricted antimicrobials: meropenem (0.11), teicoplanin (0.02), vancomycin (0.08; 0.11), linezolid (0.08; 0.08), daptomycin (x), amphotericin B liposomal (0.01).A useful method for antimicrobial DDD measurement in neonatology has been designed to monitor antimicrobial consumption in hospital settings. It should be validated in further studies and thereby included in the design for neonatal antimicrobial stewardship programs in the future.","['Antimicrobial consumption', 'Consumo de antimicrobianos', 'Neonatal antimicrobial prescription', 'Neonatology', 'Neonatología', 'Prescripción de antimicrobianos en neonatos']"
A meta-analysis of temporal changes of response in the placebo arm of surgical randomized controlled trials: an update.,"Temporal changes in the placebo arm of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have not been thoroughly investigated, despite the fact that results of RCTs depend on the comparison between arms.In this update of our earlier systematic review and meta-analysis, we set out to investigate the effect of assessment time and number of visits on the magnitude of change from baseline in the placebo arm of these trials. We used linear mixed-effects models to account for within-trial correlations.Across all 47 trials the magnitude of response in the placebo arm did not change with time (β = -0.0070, 95% CI -0.024, 0.010) or visit (β = -0.033, 95% CI -0.082, 0.017) and remained significantly different from baseline for at least 12 months or seven follow-up visits. Change in the placebo arm in trials with subjective outcomes was large (β<sub>0</sub> = 0.68, 95% CI 0.53, 0.82) and relatively constant across time (β = -0.0042, 95% CI -0.024, 0.016) and visit (β = -0.029, 95% CI -0.089, 0.031), whereas in trials with objective outcomes the response was smaller (β<sub>0</sub> = 0.28, 95% CI 0.11, 0.46) and diminished with time (β = -0.030, 95% CI -0.050, -0.010), but not with visit (β = -0.099, 95% CI -0.30, 0.11). For trials with assessed outcomes, there was no significant effect of time (β = -0.0071, 95% CI -0.026, 0.011) or visit (β = -0.032, 95% CI -0.33, 0.26); however, these results should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of studies, and high clinical heterogeneity between studies. In trials with pain as an outcome, the improvement was significant (β<sub>0</sub> = 0.91, 95% CI 0.75, 1.07), but there was no effect of time (β = -0.013, 95% CI -0.06, 0.03) or visit (β = -0.045, 95% CI -0.16, 0.069), and pain ratings remained significantly different from baseline for 12 months or seven visits.These results are consistent with our previous findings. In trials with subjective outcomes response in the placebo arm remains large and relatively constant for at least a year, which is interesting considering that this is an effect of a single application of an invasive procedure. The lack of effect of time and visit number on subjective outcomes raises further questions regarding whether the observed response is the result of placebo effect or the result of bias.","['Metaanalysis', 'Placebos', 'Randomized controlled trials', 'Surgery', 'Systematic review']"
Identifying the culprit artery via 12-lead electrocardiogram in inferior wall ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction: A meta-analysis.,"Inferior wall ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is mostly caused by acute occlusion of right coronary artery (RCA) and left circumflex artery (LCX). Several methods and algorithms using 12-lead ECG were developed to localize the lesion in inferior wall STEMI. However, the diagnostic properties of these methods remain under-recognized.The aim of this meta-analysis is to compare the diagnostic properties among the methods of identifying culprit artery in inferior wall STEMI using 12-lead ECG.We performed a meta-analysis to calculate the pooled sensitive, specificity, area under the curve (AUC) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of each method.Thirty-three studies with 4414 participants were included in the analysis. Methods using double leads had better diagnostic properties, especially ST-segment elevation (STE) in III > II [with pooled sensitivity 0.89 (0.84-0.93), specificity 0.68 (0.57-0.79), DOR 17 (9-32), AUC 0.88 (0.85-0.91)], ST-segment depression (STD) in aVL > I [with pooled sensitivity 0.82 (0.72-0.90), specificity 0.69 (0.48-0.86), DOR 11 (4-29), AUC 0.85 (0.81-0.88)], and STD V3/STE III ≤1.2 [with pooled sensitivity 0.88 (0.78-0.95), specificity 0.59 (0.42-0.75), DOR 12 (5-27), AUC 0.82 (0.78-0.85)]. Diagnostic algorithms, including Jim score[pooled sensitivity 0.70 (0.55-0.85), specificity 0.88 (0.75-0.96)], Fiol's algorithm [pooled sensitivity 0.54 (0.44-0.62), specificity 0.92 (0.88-0.96)] and Tierala's algorithm [pooled sensitivity 0.60 (0.49-0.71), specificity 0.91 (0.86-0.96)], were not superior to these simple methods.Our meta-analysis indicated that diagnostic methods using double leads had better properties. STE in III > II together with STD in aVL > I may be the most ideal method, for its accuracy and convenience.","['STsegment elevation myocardial infarction', 'culprit artery', 'electrocardiogram', 'inferior wall']"
The Influence of Running and Dancing on the Occurrence and Progression of Premenstrual Disorders.,"<i>Background</i>: The aim of the study was to assess the influence of both physical activity, such as running and dancing, and the personal characteristics of the studied women on the occurrence and progression of premenstrual disorder (PMD). <i>Methods</i>: We surveyed 414 women aged 22-48 who were experiencing the menstrual cycle but not using hormonal contraception. There were two physically active groups, runners (<i>N</i> = 215) and Argentine tango dancers (<i>N</i> = 94), and there was one group not undertaking any physical activity-the control group (<i>N</i> = 104). The research was conducted using the researchers' own questionnaire. <i>Results</i>: The number of days of PMD symptoms in the tango vs. runner vs. control groups are as follows: pre-bleeding (mean: 4.14 vs. 4.86 vs. 4.85; <i>p</i> = 0.024), after the onset of bleeding (mean: 1.76 vs. 2.39 vs. 2.16; <i>p</i> = 0.001), and in total (mean: 5.94 vs. 7.25 vs. 7.01; <i>p</i> < 0.001). The regression analysis results without grouping results are as follows: the number of days of symptoms before bleeding and menarche (B: -0.16; 95% CIs: from -0.29 to -0.04; <i>p</i> = 0.011), the total duration of symptoms and menarche (B: -0.17; 95% CIs: from -0.32 to -0.01; <i>p</i> = 0.036), lower abdominal pain and age (B: -0.05; 95% CIs: 0.92-0.98; <i>p</i> = 0.002), diarrhoea (B: -0.08; 95% CIs: 0.88-0.97; <i>p</i> < 0.001), tearfulness, depressive states and age (B: -0.06; 95% CIs: 0.91-0.97; <i>p</i> < 0.001), skin problems and age (B: -0.05; 95% CIs: 0.92-0.98; <i>p</i> = 0.004), joint pain and age (B: -0.09; 95% CIs: 0.86-0.96; <i>p</i> = 0.001), pain in the lumbar spine (B: -0.06, 95% CIs: 0.91-0.98; <i>p</i> = 0.001), water retention and BMI (B: 0.09; 95% CIs: 0.92-0.98; <i>p</i> = 0.007), and water retention and menarche (B: -0.19; 95% CIs: 0.73-0.94; <i>p</i> = 0.003). <i>Information</i>: generally there is one regression model, we have several here, we have a bit the description. <i>Conclusions</i>: Physical activity such as dancing (tango) shortens the duration of PMD symptoms but does not completely eliminate them. Running does not have as beneficial an effect on symptom relief as dancing. Current age, age when menstruation began (menarche), and BMI were revealed to be important factors influencing the symptoms of premenstrual disorders.","['dance', 'physical activity', 'premenstrual disorders', 'run']"
Non-pharmacological self-management for people living with migraine or tension-type headache: a systematic review including analysis of intervention components.,"To assess the effect of non-pharmacological self-management interventions against usual care, and to explore diﬀerent components and delivery methods within those interventions PARTICIPANTS: People living with migraine and/or tension-type headache INTERVENTIONS: Non-pharmacological educational or psychological self-management interventions; excluding biofeedback and physical therapy.We assessed the overall effectiveness against usual care on headache frequency, pain intensity, mood, headache-related disability, quality of life and medication consumption in meta-analysis.We also provide preliminary evidence on the effectiveness of intervention components and delivery methods.We found a small overall effect for the superiority of self-management interventions over usual care, with a standardised mean diﬀerence (SMD) of -0.36 (-0.45 to -0.26) for pain intensity; -0.32 (-0.42 to -0.22) for headache-related disability, 0.32 (0.20 to 0.45) for quality of life and a moderate effect on mood (SMD=0.53 (-0.66 to -0.40)). We did not find an effect on headache frequency (SMD=-0.07 (-0.22 to 0.08)).Assessment of components and characteristics suggests a larger effect on pain intensity in interventions that included explicit educational components (-0.51 (-0.68 to -0.34) vs -0.28 (-0.40 to -0.16)); mindfulness components (-0.50 (-0.82 to -0.18) vs 0.34 (-0.44 to -0.24)) and in interventions delivered in groups vs one-to-one delivery (0.56 (-0.72 to -0.40) vs -0.39 (-0.52 to -0.27)) and larger effects on mood in interventions including a cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) component with an SMD of -0.72 (-0.93 to -0.51) compared with those without CBT -0.41 (-0.58 to -0.24).Overall we found that self-management interventions for migraine and tension-type headache are more effective than usual care in reducing pain intensity, mood and headache-related disability, but have no effect on headache frequency. Preliminary findings also suggest that including CBT, mindfulness and educational components in interventions, and delivery in groups may increase effectiveness.PROSPERO 2016:CRD42016041291.","['Migraine', 'Preventive Medicine', 'Selfhelp', 'Selfmanagement Intervention', 'Tensiontype Headache']"
"Features of Plasma Homocysteine, Vitamin B12, and Folate in Parkinson's Disease: An Updated Meta-Analysis.","Many studies have shown that the levels of homocysteine (Hcy), vitamin B12 (Vit B12), and folate (FA) are abnormal in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), but the results have not been consistent. Therefore, we conducted this meta-analysis to summarize the features of Hcy, Vit B12, and FA in PD patients.A systematic literature search was conducted on PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Embase databases.A total of 71 studies were included. The analysis showed the following. (1) PD patients had significantly increased Hcy level (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.80, 95% confidence interval [CI] [0.61, 0.99]; <i>p</i> < 0.001), and decreased Vit B12 (SMD -0.33, 95% CI [-0.43, -0.22]; <i>p</i> <0.001) and FA levels (SMD -0.13, 95% CI [-0.19, -0.06]; <i>p</i> < 0.001) compared to healthy controls. (2) Higher Hcy level (SMD 0.48, 95% CI [0.30, 0.67]; <i>p</i> < 0.001) was found in Dopaminergic medications treated PD patients than in untreated patients. (3) PD patients with cognitive impairment had higher Hcy level (SMD 0.71, 95% CI [0.50, 0.92]; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and lower Vit B12 (SMD -0.22, 95% CI [-0.34, -0.09]; <i>p</i> = 0.001) and FA levels (SMD -0.17, 95% CI [-0.29, -0.04]; <i>p</i> = 0.009) than those with no cognitive impairment. (4) PD patients with neuropathy had significantly increased Hcy level (SMD 0.87, 95% CI [0.43, 1.31]; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and decreased Vit B12 level (SMD -0.40, 95% CI [-0.81, -0.00]; <i>p</i> = 0.049) compared to PD patients with no neuropathy.In conclusion, PD patients may have higher Hcy levels and lower Vit B12 and FA levels than the healthy population. Thus, Hcy, Vit B12, and FA may play a role in cognitive impairment and neuropathy in PD patients.","['Hcy', 'PD', 'Parkinsons disease', 'folate', 'homocysteine', 'vitamin B12']"
Relationship between dietary selenium intake and serum thyroid function measures in U.S. adults: Data from NHANES 2007-2012.,"Although numerous studies have explored the relationship between selenium intake and thyroid diseases, few epidemiological studies have investigated the association between selenium intake and thyroid hormones. Therefore, we conducted this analysis to investigate the association between dietary selenium intake and thyroid hormones. Our sample included 5,575 adults (age ≥ 20) years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2012. Thyroid hormones, including total triiodothyronine (T3), total thyroxine (T4), free T3 (FT3), free T4 (FT4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), were detected. Multivariable linear regression models showed that log10-transformed selenium intake (LogSe) was negatively correlated with TT4 (β = -0.383, 95% CI: -0.695, -0.070) and TT4/TT3 (β = -0.003, 95% CI: -0.006, -0.0004) in U.S. adults. Besides, additional stratified analyses by sex demonstrated that LogSe was negatively associated with TT4 (β = -0.007, 95% CI: -0.013, -0.001) and TT4/TT3 (β = -0.664, 95% CI: -1.182, -0.146) and positively associated with FT4/TT4 (β = 0.031, 95% CI: 0.004, 0.059) in male adults. Meanwhile, subgroup analysis by iodine status showed that LogSe was negatively associated with TT4 (β = -0.006, 95% CI: -0.011, -0.002), FT4/FT3 (β = -0.011, 95% CI: -0.023, -0.00002) and TT4/TT3 (β = -0.456, 95% CI: -0.886, -0.026) in iodine sufficiency but not in iodine deficiency adults. Our results demonstrated that the increased dietary selenium intake was negatively correlated with TT4 and TT4/TT3 in U.S. adults. Furthermore, the association between dietary selenium intake and thyroid hormones was more pronounced in males and iodine sufficiency adults.","['NHANES', 'iodine status', 'selenium', 'sex', 'thyroid hormones']"
Utility of dual-layer spectral-detector CT imaging for predicting pathological tumor stages and histologic grades of colorectal adenocarcinoma.,"To assess the utility of Dual-layer spectral-detector CT (DLCT) in predicting the pT stage and histologic grade for colorectal adenocarcinoma (CRAC).A total of 131 patients (mean 62.7 ± 12.9 years; 72 female, 59 male) with pathologically confirmed CRAC (35 pT1-2, 61 pT3, and 35 pT4; 32 high grade and 99 low grade), who received dual-phase DLCT were enrolled in this retrospective study. Normalized iodine concentration (NIC), slope of the spectral HU curve (λHU), and effective atomic number (Eff-Z) were measured for each lesion by two radiologists independently. Intraobserver reliability and interobserver agreement were assessed. The above values were compared between three pT-stage and two histologic-grade groups. The correlation between the pT stages and above values were assessed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were calculated to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy.Intra-class correlation coefficients were ranged from 0.856 to 0.983 for all measurements. Eff-Z [7.21(0.09) vs 7.31 (0.10) vs 7.35 (0.19)], NIC<sub>AP</sub> [0.11 (0.05) vs 0.15 (0.08) vs 0.15 (0.08)], NIC<sub>VP</sub> [0.27 (0.06) vs 0.34 (0.11) vs 0.35 (0.12)], λHU<sub>AP</sub> [1.20 (0.45) vs 1.93 (1.18) vs 2.37 (0.91)], and λHU<sub>VP</sub> [2.07 (0.68) vs 2.35 (0.62) vs 3.09 (1.07)] were significantly different among pT stage groups (all <i>P</i><0.001) and exhibited a positive correlation with pT stages (<i>r</i>= 0.503, 0.455, 0.394, 0.512, 0.376, respectively, all <i>P</i><0.001). Eff-Z [7.37 (0.10) vs 7.28 (0.08)], NIC<sub>AP</sub>[0.20 (0.10) vs 0.13 (0.08)], NIC<sub>VP</sub>[0.35 (0.07) vs 0.31 (0.11)], and λHU<sub>AP</sub> [2.59 (1.11) vs 1.63 (0.75)] in the high-grade group were markedly higher than those in the low-grade group (all <i>P</i><0.05). For discriminating the advanced- from early-stage CARC, the AUCs of Eff-Z, NIC<sub>AP</sub>, NIC<sub>VP</sub>, λHU<sub>AP</sub>, and λHU<sub>VP</sub> were 0.83, 0.80, 0.79, 0.86, and 0.68, respectively (all <i>P</i><0.001). For discriminating the high- from low-grade CARC, the AUCs of Eff-Z, NIC<sub>AP</sub>, NIC<sub>VP</sub>, and λHU<sub>AP</sub> were 0.81, 0.81, 0.64, and 0.81, respectively (all <i>P</i><0.05).The quantitative parameters derived from DLCT may provide new markers for assessing pT stages and histologic differentiation in patients with CRAC.","['Xray computed', 'colorectal neoplasms', 'neoplasm staging', 'pathology', 'tomography']"
"Intervention Effect of Aerobic Exercise on Physical Fitness, Emotional State and Mental Health of Drug Addicts: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","This study aims to discuss evidence for the efficacy of aerobic exercise in reducing drug addiction and improving the physical and mental health of drug addicts. We systematically searched several online databases as of the end of September 2022, including PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, Science Direct, CNKI, VIP, CBM, and Wanfang. All articles were identified, screened and included according to the inclusion or exclusion criteria. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions was used as a criterion for assessing the methodological quality of included studies. Random and fixed effects models were used for the analysis of standard mean differences (SMD) or mean differences (MD) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI). A total of 27 studies involving 2022 drug addicts were finally included in the analysis. The results of the meta-analysis showed that aerobic exercise could improve the physical fitness [body fat percentage: MD = -0.74, 95%CI (-1.40, -0.08), vital capacity: MD = 213.79, 95%CI (46.28, 381.29), muscle force: MD = 1.21, 95%CI (0.34, 2.08), flexibility: MD = 4.61, 95%CI (2.98, 6.25), balance: MD = 9.95, 95%CI (6.29, 13.62)], regulate the systolic blood pressure: MD = -4.38, 95%CI (-7.08, -1.68), diastolic blood pressure: MD = -2.66, 95% CI (-3.82, -1.51), beats per minute: MD =-1.92, 95%CI (-3.19, -0.65); emotional state [anxiety: MD = -4.56, 95% CI (-5.67, -3.45), depression: MD = -3.28, 95%CI (-5.16, -1.39), drug craving: SMD= -1.68,95% CI(-2.56, -0.80)], and promote the mental health [anxiety: MD = -0.22, 95%CI (-0.33, -0.11), obsessive-compulsive: MD = -0.26, 95%CI (-0.50, -0.03), somatization: MD = -0.21, 95%CI (-0.27, -0.14), depression: MD = -0.21, 95%CI (-0.28, -0.15), psychoticcism: MD = -0.12, 95%CI (-0.18, -0.06), phobic anxiety: MD = -0.11, 95%CI (-0.16, -0.07), paranoid ideation: MD = -0.09, 95%CI (-0.15, -0.02), interpersonal sensitivity: MD = -0.16, 95%CI (-0.22, -0.10), hostility: MD = -0.12, 95%CI (-0.18, -0.05)], with statistically significant differences(<i>p</i> < 0.05)] of drug addicts. Thus, aerobic exercise could effectively improve the physical fitness, emotional state and mental health of drug addicts, and reduce their drug addiction. For clinical practitioners and researchers, this study could provide more reliable evidence for addiction treatment.","['aerobic exercise', 'drug addicts', 'emotional state', 'mental health', 'metaanalysis', 'physical fitness']"
Associations between Hunger and Psychological Outcomes: A Large-Scale Ecological Momentary Assessment Study.,"Studies assessing the association between hunger and psychological states have been conducted in laboratory settings, or limited to persons with eating disorders. In this study, 748 community-dwelling adults (56.4% women, 60.0 ± 9.3 years) completed the Ecological Momentary Assessment four times a day (08:00, 12:00, 16:00 and 20:00) for seven days. At each assessment, respondents indicated their current hunger level, food intake, and psychological states (sad, anxious, active, lively, distracted, anhedonic, angry, slow thinking and restless). Time-lagged associations assessing the effect of hunger on subsequent psychological states 4 h later and vice-versa were assessed. Hunger intensity increased subsequent active feeling (coefficient and 95% confidence interval: 0.029 (0.007; 0.051)) and lively feeling (0.019 (0.004; 0.034)) and decreased later slow thinking (-0.016 (-0.029; -0.003)). Previous eating increased later activity (0.116 (0.025; 0.208)). Feeling active (0.050 (0.036; 0.064)), lively (0.045 (0.023; 0.067)) and restless (0.040 (0.018; 0.063)) increased later hunger intensity, while distraction (-0.039 (-0.058; -0.019)) and slow thinking (-0.057 (-0.080; -0.034)) decreased it. No association was found between hunger, food intake and negative psychological states (sadness, anxiety and anger). Conclusions: Positive psychological states and hunger influence each other, while no association was found between hunger and negative psychological states.","['Ecological Momentary Assessment', 'epidemiology', 'food intake', 'hunger', 'psychology']"
Influence of Swimming Training Session on Selected Saliva Components in Youth Swimmers.,"Exercise may induce many changes in biochemical parameters of the saliva. Thanks to non-invasive access, saliva can be used as a diagnostic material in physical activity monitoring. The aim of the study was comparison of selected salivary components in swimmers before and after training session. 40 male subjects aged 12-15, out of whom 30 were competitive swimmers and 10 control were involved in the study. Salivary samples were collected from all subjects in the morning, and in the afternoon; from the swimmers, they were also collected before and after the workout. Salivary flow rate-V, pH, total protein-P, alpha-amylase-Amy, salivary peroxidase-SPO, cortisol-C, total antioxidant status-TAS, sialic acid (free-FSA, bound-GSA, total-TSA), calcium-Ca, magnesium-Mg were measured. The swimmers assessed the workout intensity of training session using the RPE Foster's scale. The circadian rhythm pattern of some salivary components and differences after training were found. In swimmers after the morning exercise significant increase of P (0.83 ± 0.27 vs. 1.10 ± 0.58 g/L), Amy (64.91 ± 70.86 vs. 87.07 ± 92.46IU/L), Ca (3.83 ± 1.33 vs. 4.99 ± 2.24 mg/L), Mg (0.52 ± 0.32 vs. 0.73 ± 0.34 mg/L), TAS (0.64 ± 0.27 vs. 0.72 ± 0.26 mmol/L) and decrease V (0.47 ± 0.37 vs. 0.36 ± 0.22 mg/min), C (5.86 ± 5.00 vs. 3.54 ± 5.07 μg/ml) were found. After the afternoon training significant increase of pH (7.13 ± 0.33 vs. 7.27 ± 0.24), Amy (111.53 ± 120.13 vs. 130.91 ± 161.14IU/L), Ca (3.72 ± 1.34 vs. 4.61 ± 1.58 mg/L), Mg (0.48 ± 0.28 vs. 0.60 ± 0.39 mg/L), TSA (5.64 ± 3.78 vs. 6.10 ± 3.08 mg/L), GSA (3.00 ± 3.06 vs. 3.38 ± 2.26 mg/L), and decrease of V (0.63 ± 0.63 vs. 0.49 ± 0.39 ml/min) were noticed. Before training in the morning in the swimmers significantly higher of V (0.47 ± 0.37 vs. 0.26 ± 0.15 mg/min), TAS (0.64 ± 0.27 vs. 0.40 ± 0.16 mmol/L), and lower pH (7.01 ± 0.46 vs. 7.53 ± 0.33), P (0.83 ± 0.27 vs. 1.86 ± 1.28 g/L), Amy (64.91 ± 70.86 vs. 146.56 ± 114.45IU/L) compared to the control were found. In the afternoon in swimmers before training session significantly lower pH (7.13 ± 0.33 vs. 7.53 ± 0.49) and Amy (111.53 ± 120.13 vs. 170.98 ± 107.72IU/L) in comparison to the control were noticed. The RPE scores were negatively correlated with V (rho = -0.500, <i>p</i> = 0.05 and pH (rho = -0.382, <i>p</i> = 0.03) measured after the morning session and after the afternoon training with V (rho = -0.570, <i>p</i> = 0.01) and Ca (rho = -0.401, <i>p</i> = 0.08). The levels of salivary flow rate, alpha amylase, cortisol, calcium, magnesium were associated with swimming training session, and showed circadian variation without a significant effect on their responses to exercise.","['RPE scale', 'exercise', 'salivary components', 'swimming training session', 'youth']"
Understanding Cognitive Deficits in People with Arthritis.,"Cognitive deficits are commonly seen in people with arthritis. However, previous studies focused primarily on small-sized clinical samples. There is a need for cohort-based studies, which are characterized by high generalizability. In addition, these studies mainly focused on attention, memory, and executive function. However, cognition is not a single concept, but includes other cognitive domains, such as verbal fluency and arithmetic abilities. Thus, we aim to explore how arthritis can affect cognitive abilities, including episodic memory, semantic verbal fluency, fluid reasoning, and numerical ability by using a large cohort from the United Kingdom. The main findings were that people with arthritis have significantly lower immediate word recall (t(2257) = -6.40, <i>p</i> < 0.001, Cohen's d = -0.12, 95% C.I. = [-0.16, -0.08]), delayed word recall (t(2257) = -5.60, <i>p</i> < 0.001, Cohen's d = -0.11, 95% C.I. = [-0.14, -0.07]), semantic verbal fluency (t(2257) = -3.03, <i>p</i> < 0.01, Cohen's d = -0.06, 95% C.I. = [-0.10, -0.02]), fluid reasoning (t(2257) = -3.96, <i>p</i> < 0.001, Cohen's d = -0.07, 95% C.I. = [-0.11, -0.04]), and numerical ability (t(2257) = -3.85, <i>p</i> < 0.001, Cohen's d = -0.07, 95% C.I. = [-0.10, -0.03]) compared to what they would expect given their demographics. Interventions are needed to improve cognitive abilities in people with arthritis.","['arthritis', 'cognitive deficits', 'episodic memory', 'fluid reasoning', 'numerical ability', 'semantic verbal fluency']"
Meta-Analysis of Vitamin D Receptor Gene Polymorphisms in Childhood Asthma.,"We conducted the systematic review to investigate the potential relationship between the vitamin polymorphisms of D receptor (VDR) gene and childhood asthma. Relevant studies researching on VDR polymorphisms and asthma susceptibility were searched throughout Embase, PubMed, China Science and technology journal database (CQVIP), etc. till 12 April, 2021. We calculated the pooled odds ratios (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) using RevMan 5.3 software and Stata 11.0. FokI (rs2228570) could significantly affect childhood asthma risk across co dominant model (Ff vs. FF: OR (95%CI) = 0.82 (0.65, 1.02), <i>P</i> = 0.071) and dominant model (ff+Ff vs. FF: OR (95%CI) = 0.77 (0.63, 0.95), <i>P</i> = 0.016), especially among Caucasians in additive model (f vs. F: OR (95%CI) = 0.63 (0.43, 0.92), <i>P</i> = 0.015) and dominant model (ff+Ff vs. FF: OR (95%CI) = 0.67 (0.51, 0.88), <i>P</i> = 0.004). TaqI (rs731236) was significantly related with childhood asthma in additive model (t vs. T: OR (95%CI) = 0.45 (0.23, 0.89), <i>P</i> = 0.022), co dominant model (Tt vs. TT: OR (95%CI) = 0.36 (0.17, 0.77), <i>P</i> = 0.009), and dominant model (tt+Tt vs. TT: OR (95%CI) = 0.36 (0.15, 0.87), <i>P</i> = 0.024) among Asian, as well as population-based subgroup in co dominant model (Tt vs. TT: OR (95%CI) = 0.53 (0.31, 0.94), <i>P</i> = 0.029). However, no evidence supported the role of ApaI (rs7975232) and BsmI (rs1544410) polymorphisms in childhood asthma. FokI and TaqI polymorphisms were found to be related with the susceptibility of childhood asthma. However, it seems that ApaI and BsmI polymorphisms are not related with childhood asthma susceptibility.","['childhood asthma', 'polymorphisms', 'susceptibility', 'systematic review', 'vitamin D receptor']"
Effect of Soy and Soy Isoflavones on Obesity-Related Anthropometric Measures: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Clinical Trials.,"Soy may be a suitable food for anti-obesity efforts because of its high protein and isoflavone content. We conducted this meta-analysis to evaluate potential effects of soy and soy isoflavones on weight, waist circumference, and fat mass. PubMed, MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched. Twenty-four trials with soy and 17 trials with isoflavones passed the eligibility stage. According to the results, soy showed no overall statistically significant effect on weight, waist circumference, or fat mass, but a significant increasing effect on weight was observed in some circumstances: for instance, in obese subjects [mean difference (MD): 0.80 kg; 95% CI: 0.15, 1.45 kg; <i>P</i> = 0.02], with ingestions of ≥40 g soy protein/d (MD: 0.94 kg; 95% CI: 0.11, 1.77 kg; <i>P</i> = 0.03), with short-term applications (1-3 mo) (MD: 0.45 kg; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.86 kg; <i>P</i> = 0.03), and when soy was compared with meat (MD: 0.36 kg; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.64 kg; <i>P</i> = 0.03) and whey protein (MD: 1.53 kg; 95% CI: 0.10, 2.96 kg; <i>P</i> = 0.04). In contrast to the effects of soy on weight, soy significantly decreased waist circumference in older ages (MD: -0.36 cm; 95% CI: -0.71, -0.01 cm; <i>P</i> = 0.04), in women (MD: -0.32 cm; 95% CI: -0.57, -0.08 cm; <i>P</i> = 0.01), and at doses of <40 g soy protein/d (MD: -0.31 cm; 95% CI: -0.57, -0.05 cm; <i>P</i> = 0.02). Isoflavone studies, conducted only in women, showed that isoflavones may reduce body mass index (BMI; in kg/m<sup>2</sup>) (MD: -0.26; 95% CI: -0.55, 0.04; <i>P</i> = 0.085), especially in dosages <100 mg/d (MD: -0.48; 95% CI: -0.90, -0.06; <i>P</i> = 0.02) and in intervention periods of 2-6 mo (MD: -0.28; 95% CI: -0.56, 0.00; <i>P</i> = 0.053), but no effect was observed in higher doses or longer intervention periods. Also, a trend for reduced BMI after consumption of isoflavones was observed in Caucasians (MD: -0.35; 95% CI: -0.74, 0.04; <i>P</i> = 0.08). Overall, results showed that, although soy is the major source of isoflavones, soy and isoflavones may have different impacts on weight status.","['fat mass', 'isoflavones', 'soy', 'waist circumference', 'weight']"
Characterization of Maternal Psychosocial Stress During Pregnancy: The Healthy Start Study.,"To capture multidimensional maternal psychosocial stress using responses from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) administered during pregnancy, and to identify sociodemographic, biological, and health behavioral correlates of the stress domains.Using data from 1,079 pregnant women, we implemented principal component analysis on EPDS and PSS responses and retained factors based on the Scree plot and Eigenvalues >1. We then used linear regression to identify perinatal correlates of each domain.We identified three stress domains: ""Feeling Overwhelmed,"" ""Anhedonia,"" and ""Lack of Control,"" which accounted for 10.6% of variance in questionnaire responses. In multivariable analyses, household income ≤$70,000 (<i>β</i> = 0.21 confidence interval [95% CI: 0.05-0.39]), primiparity (0.36 [0.02-0.71]), inadequate (0.21 [0.04-0.39]) or excessive gestational weight gain (0.27 [0.11-0.42]), and Healthy Eating Index (HEI) score ≤57 (0.14 [0.00-0.28]) were associated with Feeling Overwhelmed. Older age (0.02 [0.00-0.03] per 1-year), Hispanic ethnicity (0.19 [0.00-0.38]), and HEI score ≤57 (0.15 [0.02-0.28]) were associated with Anhedonia. Non-Hispanic Black race/ethnicity (0.37 [0.10-0.63]), not having graduated from college (0.16 [-0.02 to 0.35]), having a partner born outside the United States (0.17 [-0.02 to 0.37]), household size of ≥5 persons (0.21 [-0.02 to 0.37]), receiving public assistance (0.18 [-0.02 to 0.37]), and prenatal smoking (0.32 [0.05-0.59]) were associated with Lack of Control.Three domains of maternal psychosocial stress during pregnancy (Feeling Overwhelmed, Anhedonia, and Lack of Control) were differentially related to sociodemographic, biological, and health behavioral characteristics that may be targets for interventions to ameliorate stress in pregnant women.<i>:</i> The Healthy Start study is registered as an observational study at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT #002273297).","['maternal stress', 'principal component analysis', 'psychosocial stress']"
Early Pixel Value Ratios to Assess Bone Healing During Distraction Osteogenesis.,"<b>Background:</b> Distraction osteogenesis (DO) is an approach for bone lengthening and reconstruction. The pixel value ratio (PVR), an indicator calculated from X-ray images, is reported to assess the final timing for the external fixator removal. However, the early PVR and its potential influencing factors and the relationship between the early PVR and clinical outcomes are rarely discussed. Therefore, this study was employed to address these issues. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 125 patients with bone lengthening were investigated retrospectively. The early PVR of regenerated bone was monitored in the first 3 months after osteotomy. The potential effect of sex, chronological age, BMI, lengthening site, and involvement of internal fixation during the consolidation period was analyzed. Moreover, the associations of the healing index (HI) and lengthening index (LI) with early PVR were also investigated. <b>Results:</b> The early PVRs were 0.78 ± 0.10, 0.87 ± 0.06, and 0.93 ± 0.06 in the first 3 months after osteotomy, respectively. Moreover, the PVR in juvenile was significantly higher than that in adults in the first 3 months after osteotomy (0.80 ± 0.09 vs. 0.74 ± 0.10; <i>p</i> = 0.008), (0.89 ± 0.06 vs. 0.83 ± 0.06; <i>p</i> = 0.018), and (0.94 ± 0.05 vs. 0.87 ± 0.05; <i>p</i> = 0.003). In addition, the PVR in males was significantly higher than that in females in the first month after osteotomy (0.80 ± 0.09 vs. 0.76 ± 0.10; <i>p</i> = 0.015), and the PVR in femur site was significantly higher than that in the tibia site in the second and third months after osteotomy (0.88 ± 0.07 vs. 0.87 ± 0.06; <i>p</i> = 0.015) and (0.93 ± 0.06 vs. 0.92 ± 0.06, <i>p</i> = 0.037). However, the BMI and involvement of the internal fixator during the consolidation period seem to not influence the early PVR of regenerated callus during DO. Interestingly, the early PVR seems to be moderately inversely associated with HI (mean = 44.98 ± 49.44, r = -0.211, and <i>p</i> = 0.029) and LI (mean = 0.78 ± 0.77, r = -0.210, and <i>p</i> = 0.029), respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> The early PVR is gradually increasing in the first 3 months after osteotomy, which may be significantly influenced by chronological age, sex, and the lengthening site. Moreover, the early PVR of callus may reflect the potential clinical outcome for DO. Our results may be beneficial to the clinical management of the subjects with bone lengthening.","['Xray', 'bone lengthening', 'distraction osteogenesis', 'external fixator', 'pixel value ratio']"
Doppler ultrasound to assess the pharmacodynamic effects of splanchnic vasoactive compounds.,"In search of noninvasive biomarkers to assess the pharmacodynamic effects of portal pressure-lowering drugs, the reproducibility of flow measurements in the superior mesenteric artery was evaluated using Doppler ultrasound.A reproducibility study was conducted in 15 healthy male volunteers (18-50 y). Eight ultrasound measurements were performed for each subject: 2 observers each conducted 2 measurements during 2 separate visits. The following flow parameters were captured: peak systolic velocity (PSV), end diastolic velocity (EDV), pulsatility index (PI), volume flow (VF) and vessel diameter. Reproducibility was assessed by the intraclass correlation coefficient.Results are presented as intraclass correlation coefficient [95% confidence interval]. The flow parameters PSV, EDV, PI and VF correlated excellently within observer during visit 1 (0.888 [0.748-0.953], 0.910 [0.793-0.962], 0.844 [0.656-0.933] and 0.916 [0.857-0.951], respectively) and visit 2 (0.925 [0.829-0.968], 0.942 [0.863-0.976], 0.883 [0.719-0.954] and 0.915 [0.855-0.951], respectively). Measurements conducted during 2 separate visits by 1 observer correlated well to excellently for PSV, EDV, PI and VF (0.756 [0.552-0.875], 0.836 [0.694-0.916], 0.807 [0.631-0.904] and 0.839 [0.783-0.882], respectively). Measurements conducted by 2 distinct observers correlated well to excellently for PSV, EDV and VF during visit 1 (0.813 [0.584-0.922], 0.884 [0.597-0.945] and 0.786 [0.575-0.899], respectively) and visit 2 (0.779 [0.498-0.912], 0.861 [0.672-0.945], 0.810 [0.553-0.926], respectively). Vessel diameter measurements were poorly reproducible.Doppler ultrasound is a reproducible method for flow measurements in the superior mesenteric artery in a standardized group of healthy volunteers. Therefore, it is a promising technique to assess pharmacodynamic effects of splanchnic vasoactive compounds in early clinical drug development.","['Doppler ultrasound', 'biomarker', 'early clinical drug development', 'pharmacodynamics', 'portal hypertension', 'superior mesenteric artery']"
"Variability and efficacy in treatment effects on manic symptoms with lithium, anticonvulsants, and antipsychotics in acute bipolar mania: A systematic review and meta-analysis.","Acute mania is a psychiatric emergency requiring rapid management. However, randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown considerable individual differences in treatment effects on manic symptoms with antimanic drugs.We searched the MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and ClinicalTrials.gov to identify RCTs without language restrictions from inception to April 19, 2022. We included double-blind RCTs of oral antimanic monotherapy versus placebo in adult patients. The primary outcome was variability in improvement of manic symptoms (assessed using the coefficient of variation ratio [CVR]). The secondary outcomes were overall improvement of manic symptoms and acceptability (i.e., discontinuation for any reason). The pooled effects of outcomes were calculated by random-effects meta-analyses using restricted maximum likelihood methods. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias (ROB) Assessment Tool. This study was registered with OSF (DOI:10.17605/OSF.IO/G4JNY).We included 39 RCTs (N=12150; mean age=39·9 years, interquartile range [IQR]=38·7-41·1; mean proportion of female=48·6%, IQR=42·3%-52·3%) and investigated 14 antimanic drugs. We found that eight antimanic drugs compared to placebo were associated with lower CVRs (95% confidence interval [CI]; I<sup>2</sup>), including risperidone (0·51; 0·37-0·70; 0%), haloperidol (0·54; 0·44-0·67; 4%), olanzapine (0·59; 0·44-0·79; 47%), ziprasidone (0·61; 0·53-0·71; 0%), lithium (0·63; 0·52-0·76; 0%), quetiapine (0·65; 0·48-0·87; 2%), aripiprazole (0·68; 0·56-0·84; 25%), and cariprazine (0·70; 0·49-0·99; 28%). There were nine antimanic drugs associated with greater efficacy than placebo, including risperidone (reported as standardised mean difference; 95% CI; I<sup>2</sup>: 0·64; 0·31-0·97; 15%), haloperidol (0·57; 0·29-0·85; 64%), cariprazine (0·51; 0·24-0·78; 0%), olanzapine (0·44; 0·30-0·58; 0%), lithium (0·42; 0·29-0·55; 0%), ziprasidone (0·42; 0·26-0·58; 0%), quetiapine (0·40; 0·13-0·67; 0%), asenapine (0·40; 0·13-0·67; 0%), and aripiprazole (0·32; 0·14-0·49; 53%). Ziprasidone (reported as risk ratio; 95% CI; I<sup>2</sup>: 0·83; 0·79-0·89; 0%) and olanzapine (0·63; 0·49-0·80; 35%) were associated with better acceptability relative to placebo. Among the 39 RCTs, none had a high ROB.We demonstrated that eight antimanic drugs were associated with lower variability and better efficacy than placebo, suggesting that these antimanic drugs were associated with more homogenous and predictable improvements of manic symptoms in patients with acute mania.The study was supported by from the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST-110-2314-B-016-035, MOST-111-2314-B-016-054), Medical Affairs Bureau (MND-MAB-D-111102), and Tri-service General Hospital (TSGH-E-111229).","['Anticonvulsants', 'Antipsychotics', 'Bipolar mania', 'Metaanalysis', 'Mood stabilisers', 'Variability in improvement of manic symptoms']"
Prolactin is associated with bone mineral density in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Prolactin (PRL) exerts actions in the bone besides lactation and reproduction. This study aimed to investigate whether PRL is related to bone mineral density (BMD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).A total of 642 patients with T2DM were divided into two groups with age and body mass index (BMI) matched: mildly increased PRL (HP group, n = 101) or normal PRL (NP group, n = 541). BMD was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and compared.1) BMD, T score at lumbar spine L1-4, right hip and femur neck, and Z score at the femur neck were significantly higher in the HP than in the NP group (0.96 ± 0.16 vs. 0.92 ± 0.15g/cm<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.019; 0.88 ± 0.15vs. 0.84 ± 0.14 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.007; 0.75 ± 0.17 vs.0.70 ± 0.13 g/cm<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.001; -0.90 (-1.85, -0.20) vs. -1.40 (-2.20, -0.40), p = 0.018; -0.80 (-1.50, -0.30) vs. -1.10 (-1.80, -0.53), p = 0.026; -1.30 (-2.00, -0.60) vs. -1.70 (-2.20, -1.00), p = 0.001; -0.20 (-0.70, 0.30) vs. -0.40 (-0.90, 0.10), p = 0.026). In men, T and Z scores at the right hip and femur neck were significantly higher in the HP than in the NP group (-0.70 (-1.32, 0.20) vs. -0.90 (-1.50, -0.40), p = 0.038; -0.20 (-0.80, 0.20) vs. -0.50 (-0.10, 0.10), p = 0.027; -0.30 (-0.60, -0.30) vs. -0.40 (-0.90, 0.20), p = 0.038) but not in women. Bone turnover markers have no significant difference between groups (all p > 0.05). 2) BMD at the right hip and Z score at the right hip and femur neck were significantly positively associated with PRL (<i>r</i> = 0.087, p = 0.029; <i>r</i> = 0.089, p = 0.024; <i>r</i> = 0.087, p = 0.029). In men, BMD at L1-4 and the right hip; T score at L1-4, the right hip, and the femur neck; and Z score at the right hip and the femur neck were significantly positively associated with PRL (<i>r</i> = 0.122, p = 0.007; <i>r</i> = 0.105, p = 0.041; <i>r</i> = 0.123, p = 0.016; <i>r</i> = 0.110, p = 0.032; <i>r</i> = 0.115, p = 0.025; <i>r</i> = 0.121, p = 0.018; <i>r</i> = 0.138, p = 0.007) but not significant in women. 3) In men divided into two groups according to T score (T score at the right hip>-1 or T score at the right hip≤-1) or the median BMD at L1-4, the right hip or the femur neck, PRL was significantly higher in the higher BMD than in the lower BMD group (16.32 ± 6.12 vs. 14.78 ± 5.68 ng/ml, p = 0.012; 16.20 ± 6.21 vs. 14.73 ± 5.40 ng/ml, p = 0.014; 16.10 ± 6.01 vs. 14.80 ± 5.77 ng/ml, p = 0.032; 16.17 ± 6.04 vs. 14.76 ± 5.77 ng/ml, p = 0.02; 16.48 ± 6.05 vs. 14.98 ± 5.81 ng/ml, p = 0.020; 16.10 ± 5.98 vs. 14.80 ± 5.87 ng/ml, p = 0.035).Increased PRL was associated with better BMD in patients with T2DM, especially in men.

Comparative Study of Relative Peripheral Refraction in Children With Different Degrees of Myopia.,"To investigate the difference in the retinal refraction difference value (RDV) using multispectral refractive topography (MRT).Ninety myopic participants, who met the enrolment requirements, were examined with an automatic optometer after mydriasis. According to the value of the spherical equivalent (SE), the participants were divided into Emmetropia group (E, +0.5D < SE < -0.5D), Low Myopia (LM, -0.5D < SE ≤ -3D), and Moderate and high Myopia (MM, -3D < SE ≤ -10D). The ocular biological parameters were detected by optical biometrics (Lenstar 900, Switzerland), including axial length (AL), lens thickness (LT), and keratometry (K1, K2). Furthermore, the MRT was used to measure the retinal RDV at three concentric areas, with 15-degree intervals from fovea into 45 degrees (RDV-15, RDV 15-30, and RDV 30-45), and four sectors, including RDV-S (RDV-Superior), RDV-I (RDV-Inferior), RDV-T (RDV-Temporal), and RDV-N (RDV-Nasal).In the range of RDV-15, there was a significant difference in the value of RDV-15 between Group E (-0.007 ± 0.148) <i>vs</i>. Group LM (-0.212 ± 0.399), and Group E <i>vs</i>. Group MM (0.019 ± 0.106) (<i>P</i> < 0.05); In the range of RDV 15-30, there was a significant difference in the value of RDV 15-30 between Group E (0.114 ± 0.219) <i>vs</i>. Group LM (-0.106 ± 0.332), and Group LM <i>vs</i>. Group MM (0.177 ± 0.209; <i>P</i> < 0.05); In the range of RDV 30-45, there was a significant difference in the value of RDV 30-45 between Group E (0.366 ± 0.339) <i>vs</i>. Group LM (0.461 ± 0.304), and Group E <i>vs</i>. Group MM (0.845 ± 0.415; <i>P</i> < 0.05); In the RDV-S position, there was a significant difference in the value of RDV-S between Group LM (-0.038 ± 0.636) and Group MM (0.526 ± 0.540) (<i>P</i> < 0.05); In the RDV-I position, there was a significant difference in the value of RDV-I between Group E (0.276 ± 0.530) <i>vs</i>. Group LM (0.594 ± 0.513), and Group E <i>vs</i>. Group MM (0.679 ± 0.589; <i>P</i> < 0.05). In the RDV-T position, there was no significant difference in the value of RDV-T among the three groups. In the RDV-N position, there was a significant difference in the value of RDV-N between Group E (0.352 ± 0.623) <i>vs</i>. Group LM (0.464 ± 0.724), and Group E vs. Group MM (1.078 ± 0.627; <i>P</i> < 0.05). The RDV analysis in all directions among the three groups showed a significant difference between RDV-S and RDV-I in Group LM (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Moreover, the correlation analysis showed that SE negatively correlated with AL, RDV 30-45, RDV-S, RDV-I, and RDV-N.In this study, there was a significant difference in the value of RDV among Group E, Group LM, and Group MM, and the value of RDV in Group MM was the highest on the whole. In the range of RDV 30-45, there was a growing trend with the increase in the degree of myopia among the three groups. Furthermore, the SE negatively correlated with AL, RDV 30-45, RDV-S, RDV-I, and RDV-N.","['children', 'degrees of myopia', 'multispectral refractive topography MRT', 'relative peripheral refraction', 'retinal relative diopter RDV']"
Health-Related Quality of Life in People Across the Spectrum of CKD.,"People with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience reduced quality of life (QoL) because of the high symptom and treatment burden. Limited data exist on the factors associated with overall and domain-specific QoL across all CKD stages.Using data from a prospective, multinational study (Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Spain) in 1696 participants with CKD, we measured overall and domain-specific QoL (pain, self-care, activity, mobility, anxiety/depression) using the EuroQoL, 5 dimension, 3 level. Multivariable linear regression and logistic modeling were used to determine factors associated with overall and domain-specific QoL.QoL for patients with CKD stages 3 to 5 (n = 787; mean, 0.81; SD, 0.20) was higher than in patients on dialysis (n = 415; mean, 0.76; SD, 0.24) but lower than in kidney transplant recipients (n = 494; mean, 0.84; SD, 0.21). Factors associated with reduced overall QoL (β [95% confidence intervals]) included being on dialysis (compared with CKD stages 3-5: -0.06 [-0.08 to -0.03]), female sex (-0.03 [-0.05 to -0.006]), lower educational attainment (- 0.04 [-0.06 to -0.02), lacking a partner (-0.04 [-0.06 to -0.02]), having diabetes (-0.05 [-0.07 to -0.02]), history of stroke (-0.09 [-0.13 to -0.05]), cardiovascular disease (-0.06 [-0.08 to -0.03]), and cancer (-0.03 [-0.06 to -0.009]). Pain (43%) and anxiety/depression (30%) were the most commonly affected domains, with dialysis patients reporting decrements in all 5 domains. Predictors for domain-specific QoL included being on dialysis, presence of comorbidities, lower education, female sex, and lack of a partner.Being on dialysis, women with CKD, those with multiple comorbidities, lack of a partner, and lower educational attainment were associated with lower QoL across all stages of CKD.","['EuroQoL5D3L', 'chronic kidney disease', 'domainspecific QoL', 'quality of life']"
Optimizing Subjective Cognitive Decline to Detect Early Cognitive Dysfunction.,"The utility of subjective cognitive decline (SCD) as an indicator of preclinical AD is overshadowed by its inconsistent association with objective cognition.This study examines if manipulations of SCD measurement affect its association with early cognitive dysfunction characteristic of preclinical AD.Cognitively healthy older adults (n = 110) completed SCD questionnaires that elicited complaints in general, compared to 5 years ago (retrospective SCD) and compared to their peers (age-anchored SCD) in binary and Likert scales. Outcome cognitive tasks included an associative memory task (Face-Name Test), a visual short-term memory binding task (STMB test), and a clinical neuropsychological list learning test (Selective Reminder Test).SCD complaints, when compared to age-matched peers (age-anchored SCD) were endorsed less frequently than complaints compared to 5 years ago (retrospective SCD) (p < 0.01). In demographically adjusted regressions, age-anchored ordinal-rated SCD was associated with short term memory binding (β= -0.22, p = 0.040, CI = -0.45, -0.01), associative memory (β= -0.26, p = 0.018, CI = -0.45, -0.06), and list learning (β= -0.31, p = 0.002, CI = -0.51, -0.12). Retrospective and general ordinal-rated SCD was associated with associative memory (β= -0.25, p = 0.012, CI = -0.44, -0.06; β= -0.29, p = 0.003, CI = -0.47, -0.10) and list learning only (β= -0.25, p = 0.014, CI = -0.45, -0.05; β= -0.28, p = 0.004, CI = -0.48, -0.09).Ordinal age-anchored SCD appears better suited than other SCD measurements to detect early cognitive dysfunction characteristic of preclinical AD.","['Cognitive dysfunction', 'measurement', 'neuropsychological tests', 'preclinical Alzheimer’s disease', 'subjective cognitive decline', 'taskspecific factors']"
Predictive models for musculoskeletal injury risk: why statistical approach makes all the difference.,"Compare performance between an injury prediction model categorising predictors and one that did not and compare a selection of predictors based on univariate significance versus assessing non-linear relationships.Validation and replication of a previously developed injury prediction model in a cohort of 1466 service members followed for 1 year after physical performance, medical history and sociodemographic variables were collected. The original model dichotomised 11 predictors. The second model (M2) kept predictors continuous but assumed linearity and the third model (M3) conducted non-linear transformations. The fourth model (M4) chose predictors the proper way (clinical reasoning and supporting evidence). Model performance was assessed with R<sup>2</sup>, calibration in the large, calibration slope and discrimination. Decision curve analyses were performed with risk thresholds from 0.25 to 0.50.478 personnel sustained an injury. The original model demonstrated poorer R<sup>2</sup> (original:0.07; M2:0.63; M3:0.64; M4:0.08), calibration in the large (original:-0.11 (95% CI -0.22 to 0.00); M2: -0.02 (95% CI -0.17 to 0.13); M3:0.03 (95% CI -0.13 to 0.19); M4: -0.13 (95% CI -0.25 to -0.01)), calibration slope (original:0.84 (95% CI 0.61 to 1.07); M2:0.97 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.08); M3:0.90 (95% CI 0.75 to 1.05); M4: 081 (95% CI 0.59 to 1.03) and discrimination (original:0.63 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.66); M2:0.90 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.92); M3:0.90 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.92); M4: 0.63 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.66)). At 0.25 injury risk, M2 and M3 demonstrated a 0.43 net benefit improvement. At 0.50 injury risk, M2 and M3 demonstrated a 0.33 net benefit improvement compared with the original model.Model performance was substantially worse in the models with dichotomised variables. This highlights the need to follow established recommendations when developing prediction models.","['Injury', 'Neuromuscular', 'Prevention', 'Risk factor']"
Endoscopic treatment of benign biliary stricture using different stents: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Biodegradable biliary stents (BDBSs), fully covered self-expanded metal stents (FCSEMSs) and multiple plastic stents (MPSs) were common stents in endoscopic treatment of benign biliary stricture (BBS).To evaluate the effectiveness of these 3 stents in BBS management.The PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Wiley Library databases were searched for studies that provided data about BBS and stent therapy.We found that BDBSs were associated with the highest clinical success rate (0.76, 95% CI: 0.71-0.80), followed by MPSs (0.69, 95% CI: 0.63-0.74), and FCSEMSs (0.67, 95% CI: 0.63-0.71). BDBSs also had a relatively high probability of technical success, at 1.00 (95% CI: 1.00-1.00), superior to MPSs (0.95, 95% CI: 0.88-0.99) and FCSEMSs (0.90, 95% CI: 0.85-0.94). The treatment success rate for BDBSs (1.00, 95% CI: 1.00-1.00) was also higher than for MPSs (0.88, 95% CI: 0.72-0.98) and FCSMESs (0.82, 95% CI: 0.76-0.87). However, BDBSs had the highest stricture recurrence rate (0.21, 95% CI: 0.16-0.26), compared with FCSEMSs (0.11, 95% CI: 0.08-0.15) and MPSs (0.07, 95% CI: 0.03-0.13).Patients with BBS are likely to receive a satisfied outcome when treated with BDBSs.","['benign biliary stricture', 'endoscopy', 'metaanalyses', 'stents']"
Transepithelial Accelerated Corneal Collagen Cross-Linking: Two-Year Results.,"To report 2-year outcomes of trans-epithelial accelerated corneal collagen crosslinking (TE-ACXL) procedure in the treatment of progressive keratoconus patients.Twenty-four eyes from 24 patients who underwent TE-ACXL (6mW/cm<sup>2</sup> for 15 minutes) were included in this retrospective interventional study. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), keratometry values, thinnest corneal thickness (PachyMin) and topometric indexes were analysed preoperatively and at 6-month, 12-month, 18-month and 24-month postoperative. Progression was assessed by increase ≥1.00D in maximum keratometry (Kmax); increase ≥1.00D in corneal astigmatism; decrease ≥2% in PachyMin; increase ≥0.42 in D-index.There were no complications during or after TE-ACXL. No significant differences (Δ) were observed between baseline and 12-month or 24-month postoperative: ∆BCVA (-0.08 ± 0.25, <i>p</i>=0.190; -0.04 ± 0.17, <i>p</i>=0.588), ∆Kmax (-0.08 ± 1.32, <i>p</i>=0.792; -1.04 ± 1.89, <i>p</i>=0.135), ∆Astigmatism (-0.15 ± 0.89, <i>p</i>=0.485; -0.24 ± 1.38, <i>p</i>=0.609), ∆PachyMin (-0.56 ± 15.70, <i>p</i>=0.882; 0.56 ± 18.74, <i>p</i>=0.931), ∆Index Surface Variation (∆ISV) (-2.11 ± 10.27, <i>p</i>=0.395; -4.67 ± 17.32, <i>p</i>=0.442), ∆Index Vertical Asymmetry (∆IVA) (-0.05 ± 0.17, <i>p</i>=0.208; -0.08 ± 0.26, <i>p</i>=0.397), ∆Index Height Decentration (∆IHD) (0.00 ± 0.02, <i>p</i>=0.368; -0.01 ± 0.04, <i>p</i>=0.484), ∆KI (0.00 ± 0.05, <i>p</i>=0.851; 0.01 ± 0.06, <i>p</i>=0.877) and ∆D-index (0.15 ± 1.14, <i>p</i>=0.572; 0.06 ± 1.36, <i>p</i>=0.892). Eleven to 33% of patients had disease progression at 24-month postoperative according to the parameters used to determine progression.Although some patients maintain disease progression, TE-ACXL seems to be a safe and effective treatment for keratoconus over the 2-year follow-up period. Studies with longer follow-up periods and larger patient cohorts are recommended.","['cornea', 'crosslinking', 'disease progression', 'keratoconus', 'transepithelial']"
Evaluation of the Accuracy of Six Simple Screening Tools for Sarcopenia in Schizophrenic Patients.,"Our objective was to evaluate if SARC-F, SARC-CalF, SARC-F-EBM, calf circumference (CC), mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) and Ishii test can be used to accurately screen for sarcopenia in schizophrenic patients.We enrolled schizophrenic patients aged 50 or older, who were regularly taking antipsychotic medications, at two mental health centres. Bioimpedance-based muscle-mass was analysed with an InBody 770 instrument, while muscle strength was measured with a digital grip-strength dynamometer. The physical performance of the patients was gauged from their gait speed over 6 m. Standard AWGS2019 diagnostic criteria were used, and the accuracies of the six screening methods were indicated by the sensitivity, negative predictive value (NPV), and area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).A total of 339 stable schizophrenic patients were enrolled. The overall prevalence of sarcopenia was 53.1%, and the prevalence was 55.6% and 47.66%, respectively, for males and females. The prevalence of sarcopenia obesity in the total population was 16.22%, and that of males and females was 18.97% and 10.28%, respectively. The SARC-F, SARC-CalF, SARC-F-EBM, CC, MUAC and Ishii test sensitivity/NPV in screening for sarcopenia were 41.86%/0.52, 79.07%/0.7, 28.68%/0.51, 78.3%/0.71, 76.74%/0.7, 89.92%/0.84, respectively, in males and 45.1%/0.59, 94.12%/0.91, 54.9%/0.7, 92.16%/60.91, 74.51%/0.77, 96.08%/0.94, respectively, in females. In males, the AUCs of the SARC-F, SARC-CalF, SARC-F-EBM, CC, MUAC and Ishii test were 0.601 (95%CI, 0.528-0.673), 0.754 (95%CI,0.69-0.817), 0.657 (95%CI,0.588-0.727), 0.8 (95%CI, 0.744-0.856), 0.781 (95%CI, 0.721-0.84) and 0.88 (95%CI, 0.837-0.922), respectively, and in females, they were 0.587(95%CI,0.479-0.696), 0.794 (95%CI,0.709-0.878), 0.799 (95%CI,0.71-0.888), 0.893 (95%CI, 0.833-0.953), 0.843 (95%CI, 0.772-0.915) and 0.855 (95%CI, 0.784-0.926), respectively.The prevalence of sarcopenia in schizophrenic patients is high. Clinical doctors should screen for sarcopenia in schizophrenic patients and provide timely interventions to reduce the occurrence of adverse events. The above six tools can be used as screening tools, and the Ishii test is the most suitable for screening.","['CC', 'Ishii test', 'MUAC', 'SARCF', 'SARCFEBM', 'Schizophrenic', 'sarcopenia']"
Analysis of Asphericity and Corneal Longitudinal Spherical Aberration of 915 Chinese Myopic Adult Eyes.,"To analyze the corneal asphericity, longitudinal spherical aberration (LSA), and related factors in Chinese myopic adult eyes.This was a retrospective study of myopic adult patients. The corneal asphericity and LSA were measured at 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 6.0, and 7.0 mm diameter apertures using corneal tomography. Age and refractive power were recorded for correlation analysis.In total, 531 females and 384 males were included. At the above five diameter settings the corneal asphericity values (Q) of the anterior surface were -0.09±0.21, -0.14±0.16, -0.15±0.13, -0.17±0.11, and -0.20±0.11, and those of the posterior surface were 0.23±0.49, 0.06±0.29, -0.01±0.22, -0.07±0.16, and -0.08±0.15, respectively. The anterior corneal LSA values at these diameters were 0.39±0.19, 0.63±0.27, 0.97±0.36, 0.90±0.30, and 0.83±0.29 D, respectively and the whole corneal values were 0.26±0.20, 0.44±0.27, 0.70±0.36, 0.66±0.30, and 0.59±0.28 D, respectively. Corneal asphericity and peripheral LSA showed no or weak correlation with age or spherical equivalent (all <i>r</i> < 0.2).Corneal anterior and posterior Q values in myopia patients are negatively correlated with corneal diameter. Corneal anterior and whole corneal LSA increased significantly with diameter up to 5 mm, then decreased slightly with diameter. Corneal asphericity and peripheral LSA showed very weak or no correlation with age or spherical equivalent.ChiCTR1800015985.","['asphericity', 'longitudinal spherical aberration', 'myopia', 'wavefront aberration']"
Mediator or moderator? The role of obesity in the association between age at menarche and blood pressure in middle-aged and elderly Chinese: a population-based cross-sectional study.,"We investigated the moderation/mediation between the age of menarche and obesity parameters in predicting blood pressure (BP) in middle-aged and elderly Chinese.Our study is a population-based cross-sectional study.Participants in this study came from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS).The analytical sample included 4513 participants aged 45-96 years.Data were selected from the CHARLS, a cross-sectional study. Between-group differences were evaluated using χ<sup>2</sup>, t-test and one-way analysis of variance. The trend of related variables by characteristics was also tested using contrast analysis, as appropriate. Then, correlations between characteristics, moderator, mediator, and independent and dependent variables were used by Spearman's correlation test and Pearson's correlation test. Finally, the mediation analysis was performed by model 4 in PROCESS V3.3 macro for SSPSS, and moderation analysis was used by model 1 for assessment. All covariates were adjusted in the moderation or mediation models.In the correlation analysis, body mass index (BMI) and waist circle (WC) level were positively correlated with both systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in women (BMI and DBP: r=0.221, p<0.001; WC and DBP: r=0.183, p<0.001; BMI and SBP: r=0.129, p<0.001; WC and SBP: r=0.177, p<0.001). Age of menarche was negatively correlated with DBP (r=-0.060, p<0.001). However, the age of menarche was not significantly correlated with SBP (r=-0.014, p=0.335). In the moderator analysis, after controlling for the potential confounders, the interaction term of obesity parameters×age of menarche was not significant for predicting either DBP (BMI: B=0.0260, SE=0.0229, p=0.2556, 95% CI -0.0189 to 0.071; WC: B=0.0099, SE=0.0074, p=0.1833, 95% CI -0.0047 to 0.0244) or SBP (BMI: B=0.0091, SE=0.0504, p=0.8561, 95% CI -0.0897 to 0.108; WC: B=-0.0032, SE=0.0159, p=0.8427, 95% CI -0.0343 to 0.028). All correlations were significant correlation between age of menarche, obesity parameters and BP except the path of the menarche age→SBP (with the addition of the BMI indicator: β=-0.0004, B=-0.0046, p=0.9797, 95% CI -0.3619 to 0.3526; with the addition of the WC indicator: β=0.0004, B=0.0044, p=0.9804, 95% CI -0.3439 to 0.3526) in crude model. In general, after controlling for potential confounders, BMI (DBP: β=-0.0471, B= -0.2682, p=0.0021, 95% CI -0.4388 to -0.0976; SBP: β=-0.0515, B=-0.6314, p<0.001, 95% CI -0.9889 to -0.2739) and WC (DBP: β=-0.0474, B= -0.2689, p<0.001, 95% CI -0.4395 to -0.0984; SBP: β=-0.0524, B=-0.6320, p<0.001, 95% CI -0.9832 to -0.2807) partly mediated the relationship between age of menarche and BP.The interaction term of obesity parameters×age of menarche was not significant for predicting either DBP or SBP in women. Moreover, obesity parameters partly mediated the relationship between the age of menarche and BP.","['Hypertension', 'Nutrition', 'Risk management']"
Serum calcium levels correlates with coronary artery disease outcomes.,"Effect of serum calcium levels on prognosis of patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) is not well evaluated. We aimed to assess the associations of baseline serum calcium levels with both short-term and long-term outcomes in CAD patients.This study included 3,109 consecutive patients with angiographically confirmed CAD. Patients were categorized into quartiles according to admission serum calcium. Multivariable regression analysis was used to determine the association of serum calcium with mortality.Compared to patients in the lowest quartile of serum calcium, patients in upper quartiles were presented with lower all-cause mortality (Hazard ratios [HRs] were -0.636 [95% CI: -0.424 to -0.954], -0.545 [95% CI: -0.351 to -0.846] and -0.641 [95% CI: -0.450 to -0.913] for three upper quartiles versus lowest quartile respectively), cardiovascular mortality (HRs 0.594 [0.368-0.961], 0.261 [0.124-0.551] and 0.407 [0.229-0.725]), and in-hospital mortality (Odd ratios [ORs] 0.391 [0.188-0.812], 0.231 [0.072-0.501] and 0.223 [0.093-0.534]). Consistent associations between serum calcium and long-term mortality were also obtained in subgroup analysis of ACS patients, stable CAD patients and discharged patients.Serum calcium is inversely associated with CAD and can independently predict both in-hospital and long-term mortality among CAD patients.","['coronary artery disease', 'independent predictor', 'prognosis', 'serum calcium']"
A Potential Research Target for Scleral Remodeling: Effect of MiR-29a on Scleral Fibroblasts.,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether miR-29a regulates cell survival and apoptosis and the expression of phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome 10 (PTEN), MMP-2, and collagen I in scleral fibroblasts.We transfected scleral fibroblasts with the miR-29a mimic and inhibitor. The effects of miR-29a on cell proliferation and apoptosis were determined using the CCK-8 assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was used to determine whether miR-29a regulates the mRNA levels of PTEN, MMP-2, and collagen I. The protein expression of PTEN, MMP-2, and collagen I was also assessed by western blot analysis.The results of CCK-8 showed that, at 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after transfection, the relative optical density values in the mimic group were 0.233 ± 0.005, 0.380 ± 0.008, 0.650 ± 0.040, and 0.906 ± 0.032, and in the inhibitor group were 0.272 ± 0.011, 0.393 ± 0.029, 0.597 ± 0.059, and 0.950 ± 0.101, respectively. The flow cytometry results showed that the apoptosis rates of each group were as follows: the mimic group (0.043 ± 0.007), the NC group (0.040 ± 0.006), the inhibitor group (0.032 ± 0.003), the inhibitor NC group (0.027 ± 0.010), the lipofectamine group (0.027 ± 0.005), and the blank group (0.031 ± 0.009). The qPCR results indicated that in the mimic group, PTEN (0.795 ± 0.182, p = 0.2783), MMP-2 (0.621 ± 0.105, p = 0.0033), and COL1A1 (0.271 ± 0.100, p = 0.0002) expression decreased, whereas in the inhibitor group, PTEN (1.211 ± 0.100, p = 0.2614), MMP-2 (1.161 ± 0.053, p = 0.1190), and COL1A1 (1.7040 ± 0.093, p = 0.0003) increased. Western blot analysis showed that in the mimic group, the expression of PTEN (0.392 ± 0.039, p < 0.0001), MMP-2 (0.577 ± 0.017, p < 0.0001), and COL1A1 (0.072 ± 0.006, p < 0.0001) protein decreased, whereas in the inhibitor group, PTEN (1.043 ± 0.042, p = 0.9413), MMP-2 (1.397 ± 0.075, p = 0.0002), and COL1A1 (1.935 ± 0.081, p < 0.0001) expression increased.MiR-29a inhibits the expression of PTEN, MMP-2, and collagen I on scleral fibroblasts, which may provide a basis studies in sclera.","['Collagen I', 'Myopia', 'PTEN', 'Scleral remodeling', 'miR29a']"
The relationship between smoking frequency and life satisfaction: Mediator of self-rated health (SRH).,"It is well-established that smoking is associated with life satisfaction. However, much less is known about how smoking frequency is related to life satisfaction and if self-rated health (SRH) mediates such a relationship. This is important to understand because life satisfaction is related to a lot of outcomes such as morbidity and mortality. The aim of the current study is to test whether smoking frequency relates to life satisfaction <i>via</i> SRH pathway.Data were extracted from Wave 7 (collected between 2015 and 2016), Understanding Society: the UK Household Longitudinal Study (UKHLS). After removing non-smokers and participants with missing variables of interest, 5, 519 smokers out of 39, 293 participants remained for further analysis. Correlation coefficients were calculated between smoking frequency, SRH, and life satisfaction. Mediation analysis was performed by taking smoking frequency as the predictor, SRH as the mediator, life satisfaction as the outcome variable, and demographics as covariates using the mediation toolbox on MATLAB 2018a with 10000 bootstrap sample significance testing (https://github.com/canlab/MediationToolbox).The current study found a negative correlation between smoking frequency and life satisfaction [r = -0.09, 95% C.I (-0.12, -0.06), <i>p</i> < 0.001] and between smoking frequency and SRH [r = -0.17, 95% C.I (-0.14, -0.19), <i>p</i> < 0.001], and a positive correlation between SRH and life satisfaction [r = 0.44, 95% C.I (0.41, 0.46), <i>p</i> < 0.001]. Results from the mediation analysis revealed that there is a significant effect of Path a [i.e., smoking frequency to SRH; β = -0.02, <i>p</i> < 0.001, 95% C.I. (-0.02, -0.02)], Path b [SRH to life satisfaction; β = 0.68, <i>p</i> < 0.001, 95% C.I. (0.66, 0.69)], Path c' [direct effect; β = -0.01, <i>p</i> < 0.01, 95% C.I. (0.66, 0.69)], Path c [total effect; β =-0.02, <i>p</i> < 0.001, 95% C.I. (-0.02, -0.02)], and Path a<sup>*</sup>b [mediation effect; β = -0.01, <i>p</i> < 0.001, 95% C.I. (-0.01, -0.014)].SRH partially mediated the negative relationship between smoking frequency and life satisfaction. Findings from the current study may imply that antismoking campaigns and pamphlets are needed to counter the promotion of smoking by the tobacco industry. Moreover, interventions are needed for current smokers to reduce their smoking frequency to improve their life satisfaction, which can promote life satisfaction and positive outcomes associated with better life satisfaction.","['cigarette', 'life satisfaction', 'selfrated health', 'smoke', 'smokers', 'smoking frequency', 'tobacco', 'tobacco use']"
A new visual acuity test on touchpad for vision screening in children.,"To validate a visual acuity (VA) test application on touchpad in the screening of pediatric population by comparing VA results obtained with conventional tests.A cohort of 101 patients, 44 girls and 57 boys with a median of 6.5 years old (3-10 years of age), presenting for eye examinations in Ophthalmology Department (Strasbourg, France) between November 1<sup>st</sup>, 2018, and February 1<sup>st</sup>, 2019 were enrolled. Monocular and binocular VA testing was performed on the subject using both a standard test and the touchpad application (Monoyer, ""E"" or, Pigassou depending of children's capacities). Patients were excluded if they were physically or mentally unable to use the touchpad. The duration of each tests, the painfulness, the comprehension, the attention of children during the test and test's preferences were also evaluated.There was a good linear correlation and intra-class correlation coefficient [ICC=0.50 (0.34, 0.64) for binocular acuity, 0.74 (0.64, 0.82) for right eyes and 0.525 (0.37, 0.66) for left eye]. The standard errors of measurement were very low (0.08, 0.05, 0.08 for binocular VA, right eyes VA and left eyes VA, respectively). There was no difference between two tests for right eye (<i>P</i>=0.126), left eye (<i>P</i>=0.098) and binocular acuity (<i>P</i>=0.085). Non inferiority was proved for all binocular [-0.06 (-0.09, -0.03)], right eye [-0.04 (-0.07, -0.01)] and left eye [-0.06 (-0.09, -0.02)] VA. The sensitivity and specificity, which correspond to the ability for our app to detect amblyopia, were 92% and 80% respectively.Our touchpad application represents an efficient and valid test of VA in children with a high specificity to detect visual impairment.","['application', 'children', 'screening', 'visual acuity']"
"Association of Psychopathology Symptoms, Self-Compassion, and Forgiveness in Patients With Pulmonary Embolism.","Background Pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening disease with both physical and psychological impacts. The psychological distress in the early phase of the disease has not been previously studied in the literature.  Methods The study sample included patients with PE with or without deep vein thrombosis. All subjects included in the study prospectively completed the Symptom Checklist-90-R (SCL-90-R) questionnaire, the Heartland Forgiveness Scale (HFS), and the Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) during their hospitalization for PE. Results Forty-four PE patients were included in the study (59.1% males). The mean age was 62.27±15.03 years. The majority (77.3%) had at least one comorbidity with 9.1% previously diagnosed with depression. The Total Global Severity Index (GSI) score for SCL-90-R was 82.42±49.70 while 36.4% of subjects had a high ""Obsessive-compulsive"" score, 22.7% had a high ""Depression"" score, and 22.7% presented a high ""Hostility"" score. The total HFS score was 45.54±40.42 with 54.5% of patients classified as ""usually forgiving."" The mean SCS score was 2.05±0.65 with 59.1% of patients presenting moderate self-compassion while 18.2% had low self-compassion. The total SCS score was correlated with the total GSI score (p=0.005, r=-0.576) and total HFS score (p=0.005, r=0.675). The SCS Self-kindness score correlated with interpersonal sensitivity (p=0.024, r=-0.479), depression (p=0.008, r=-0.551), and GSI score (p=0.049, r=-0.425). Self-judgement correlated with paranoid ideation (p=0.044, r=-0.467), hostility (p=0.007, r=-0.597), and GSI (p=0.027, r=-0.505). Isolation correlated with interpersonal sensitivity (p=0.026, r=-0.509), anxiety (p=0.014, r=-0.553), hostility (p=0.032, r=-0.494), paranoid ideation (p=0.026, r=-0.509), and GSI (p=0.015, r=-0.548). The total SCS score correlated with anxiety (p=0.041, r=-0.438). SCS Self-kindness score correlated significantly with total HFS score (p=0.002, r=0.613), forgiveness of self (p=0.011, r=0.528), forgiveness of others (p=0.008, r=0.550), and forgiveness of situations (p=0.004. r=0.587). Common humanity was significantly correlated with total HFS score (p=0.023, r=0.481), forgiveness of others (p=0.033, r=0.456), and forgiveness of situations (p=0.016, r=0.507). Mindfulness was positively correlated with HFS total score (p=0.009, r=0.544), forgiveness of self (p=0.049, r=0.424), forgiveness of others (p=0.012, r=0.525), and forgiveness of situations (p=0.013, r=0.520). Conclusions We report for the first time that patients acutely hospitalized for PE present symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and hostility and exhibit moderate self-compassion. The marginal majority of PE patients are ""usually forgiving"" during the acute phase of the disease. Self-compassion is positively associated with forgiveness and negatively associated with psychiatric symptoms. Further studies are warranted in order to assess longitudinal differences in psychometric scores and the possible result of targeted mental health interventions at PE-specific clinical outcomes.","['forgiveness', 'mental health', 'pulmonary embolism', 'scl90r', 'selfcompassion', 'venous thromboembolism']"
Deep-learning model associating lateral cervical radiographic features with Cormack-Lehane grade 3 or 4 glottic view.,"Unanticipated difficult laryngoscopy is associated with serious airway-related complications. We aimed to develop and test a convolutional neural network-based deep-learning model that uses lateral cervical spine radiographs to predict Cormack-Lehane grade 3 or 4 direct laryngoscopy views of the glottis. We analysed the radiographs of 5939 thyroid surgery patients at our hospital, 253 (4%) of whom had grade 3 or 4 glottic views. We used 10 randomly sampled datasets to train a model. We compared the new model with six similar models (VGG, ResNet, Xception, ResNext, DenseNet and SENet). The Brier score (95%CI) of the new model, 0.023 (0.021-0.025), was lower ('better') than the other models: VGG, 0.034 (0.034-0.035); ResNet, 0.033 (0.033-0.035); Xception, 0.032 (0.031-0.033); ResNext, 0.033 (0.032-0.033); DenseNet, 0.030 (0.029-0.032); SENet, 0.031 (0.029-0.032), all p < 0.001. We calculated mean (95%CI) of the new model for: R<sup>2</sup> , 0.428 (0.388-0.468); mean squared error, 0.023 (0.021-0.025); mean absolute error, 0.048 (0.046-0.049); balanced accuracy, 0.713 (0.684-0.742); and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.965 (0.962-0.969). Radiographic features around the hyoid bone, pharynx and cervical spine were associated with grade 3 and 4 glottic views.","['airway evaluation', 'artificial intelligence', 'deeplearning', 'difficult laryngoscopy', 'intratracheal', 'intubation']"
"Family aspects, physical fitness, and physical activity associated with mental-health indicators in adolescents.","The objective of the study was to analyze the associations of family aspects, physical fitness, and physical activity with mental-health indicators in a sample of adolescents from Colombia.A cross-sectional study carried out in a sample of 988 adolescents (11-17 years-old) from public schools in Montería. Mental-health indicators were evaluated: Stress, depression, anxiety, happiness, health-related quality of life (HRQL), and subjective wellness. Family aspects included family affluence, functionality, and structure. These variables, along with physical activity and screen time, were measured with questionnaires. A fitness score was established by assessing the components of fitness: Flexibility, cardiorespiratory fitness, grip strength, and lower-limb strength. Associations were analyzed by multivariate linear regression models.Nuclear family structure was associated with lower stress level (- 1.08, CI: - 1.98 - -0.18), and family functionality was associated with all the studied mental-health indicators (Stress: -0.11, CI: - 0.17 - -0.06; depression: -0.20, CI: - 0.25 - -0.16; trait anxiety: -0.13, CI: - 0.18 - -0.09; state anxiety: -0.12, CI: - 0.17 - -0.08; happiness: 0.09, CI: 0.07 - 0.1; HRQL: 1.13, CI: 0.99 - 1.27; subjective wellness: 1.67, CI: 1.39 - 1.95). Physical activity was associated (β, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)) with depression (- 0.27, - 0.57 - -0.02), trait anxiety (- 0.39, CI: - 0.65 - -0.13), state anxiety (- 0.30, CI: - 0.53 - -0.07), happiness (0.14, CI: 0.06 - 0.22), HRQL (3.63, CI: 2.86 - 4.43), and subjective wellness (5.29, CI: 3.75 - 6.83). Physical fitness was associated with stress (- 0.80, CI: - 1.17 - -0.43), state anxiety (- 0.45, CI: - 0.73 - -0.17), and HRQL (1.75, CI: 0.82 - 2.69); screen time was only associated with stress (0.06, CI: 0.02 - 0.11).Family aspects were associated with mental health indicators, especially family functionality which was associated all mental-health indicators. Similarly, fitness, physical activity, and screen time were associated with the studied indicators of mental health. Particularly, physical activity was associated with all the mental-health indicators, except stress, which was only associated with screen time. Physical fitness was associated with stress, anxiety, and HRQL. Future studies could explore the causal relationships of fitness, physical activity and screen time with mental health in adolescents.","['Anxiety', 'Healthrelated quality of life', 'Mental health', 'Physical activity', 'Physical fitness', 'Sedentary behavior', 'Stress']"
Vision Impairment and Participation in Cognitively Stimulating Activities: The Health ABC Study.,"Engagement in cognitively stimulating activities is associated with decreased rates of cognitive decline in older adults. However, most cognitively stimulating tasks require good vision, potentially affecting the ability of visually impaired adults to engage in these activities. We examined the relationship between vision and participation in cognitively stimulating activities.Data from the Health, Aging, and Body Composition study (1999-2005) were analyzed. Associations between visual function (visual acuity [VA], contrast sensitivity [CS], and stereo acuity [SA] impairments) and annual rates of change in number of cognitively stimulating activities (by self-report) performed at least once a month were examined.Analyses included 924 participants aged 75.2 ± 2.8 years. At baseline, impaired CS (27%) and SA (29%) were associated with participation in fewer cognitive activities (β = -0.33, 95% CI = -0.63, -0.03 and β = -0.32, 95% CI = -0.61, -0.03, respectively), while VA (8%) was not (β = -0.34, 95% CI = -0.81, 0.13). In longitudinal models, groups with and without VA, CS, and SA impairments exhibited declines in monthly cognitive activities over time. Annual rates of decline were relatively higher in the VA (β = -0.16, 95% CI = -0.26, -0.05) and CS (β = -0.14, 95% CI = -0.19, -0.09) impaired groups than observed in the respective unimpaired groups (no VA: β = -0.12, 95% CI = -0.15, -0.10; no CS: β = -0.12, 95% CI = -0.15, -0.09), but did not achieve statistical significance. Stereo acuity (β = -0.13, 95% CI = -0.17, -0.09) and no SA (β = -0.13, 95% CI = -0.16, -0.10) groups had similar rates of decline.Visually impaired older adults participate in fewer cognitive activities and although participation decline is similar to the non-impaired, lower overall participation indicates a need to identify cognitively stimulating activities accessible to visually impaired older adults.","['Cognition', 'Cognitive Aging', 'Sensory', 'Vision loss']"
Gut dysbiosis is associated with poorer long-term prognosis in cirrhosis.,"Gut dysbiosis is common in cirrhosis.To study the influence of gut dysbiosis on prognosis in cirrhosis.The case-control study included 48 in-patients with cirrhosis and 21 healthy controls. Stool microbiome was assessed using 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid gene sequencing. We used modified dysbiosis ratio (MDR): [<i>Bacilli</i> (%) + <i>Proteobacteria</i> (%)]/[<i>Clostridia</i> (%) + <i>Bacteroidetes</i> (%)]. Patients with MDR more the median made up the group with severe dysbiosis, others did the group with non-severe dysbiosis. The follow-up period was 4 years.The mortality rate of patients with severe dysbiosis was significantly higher than that of patients with non-severe dysbiosis (54.2% <i>vs</i> 12.5%; <i>P</i> = 0.001). The presence of severe dysbiosis was independent risk factors for death [hazard ratio = 8.6 × (1.9-38.0); <i>P</i> = 0.005]. The abundance of <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.002), <i>Proteobacteria</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.002), and <i>Lactobacillaceae</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.025) was increased and the abundance of <i>Firmicutes</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.025) and <i>Clostridia</i> (<i>P</i> = 0.045) was decreased in the deceased patients compared with the survivors. The deceased patients had a higher MDR value than the survivors [0.131 × (0.069-0.234) <i>vs</i> 0.034 × (0.009-0.096); <i>P</i> = 0.004]. If we applied an MDR value of 0.14 as the cutoff point, then it predicted patient death within the next year with a sensitivity of 71.4% and a specificity of 82.9% [area under the curve = 0.767 × (0.559-0.974)]. MDR was higher in patients with cirrhosis than in health controls [0.064 × (0.017-0.131) <i>vs</i> 0.005 × (0.002-0.007); <i>P</i> < 0.001], and in patients with decompensated cirrhosis than in patients with compensated cirrhosis [0.106 × (0.023-0.211) <i>vs</i> 0.033 × (0.012-0.074); <i>P</i> = 0.031]. MDR correlated negatively with prothrombin (<i>r</i> = -0.295; <i>P</i> = 0.042), cholinesterase (<i>r</i> = -0.466; <i>P</i> = 0.014) and serum albumin (<i>r</i> = -0.449; <i>P</i> = 0.001) level and positively with Child-Turcotte-Pugh scale value (<i>r</i> = 0.360; <i>P</i> = 0.012).Gut dysbiosis is associated with a poorer long-term prognosis in cirrhosis.","['Cirrhosis', 'Dysbiosis', 'Gut', 'Gutliver axis', 'Microbiome', 'Microbiota', 'ROCanalysis']"
Differential Relationship between Tobacco Control Policies and U.S. Adult Current Smoking by Poverty.,"The study's purpose was to identify differences in the relationship between tobacco control policies and smoking by poverty. We matched state smoke-free air law coverage (SFALs), tobacco control funding (TCF), and cigarette taxes with individual current smoking and demographics from supplements to the Current Population Survey (1985-2015). We regressed (logistic) smoking on policy variables, poverty (<138% of poverty line versus ≥138% of poverty line), interactions of policy and poverty, and covariates, presenting beta coefficients instead of odds ratios because it is difficult to interpret interactions using odds ratios (they are ratios of odds ratios). We coded SFALs as (1) proportion of state covered by 100% workplace, restaurant and bar laws (SFAL-All) or (2) proportion of state covered by workplace laws (SFAL-WP) and proportion covered by restaurant or bar laws (SFAL-RB). In the SFAL-All model, SFAL-All (Beta coeff: -0.03, 95% CI: -0.06, -0.002), tax (Coeff: -0.06, 95% CI: -0.07, -0.05), and TCF (Coeff: -0.01, 95% CI: -0.01, -0.001) were associated with less smoking. In this model, the interaction of SFAL-All by poverty was significant (Coeff: 0.08, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.13). In the SFAL-WP/RB model, SFAL-RB (Coeff: -0.05, 95% CI: -0.08, -0.02), tax (Coeff: -0.05, 95% CI: -0.06, -0.04), and TCF (Coeff: -0.01, 95% CI: -0.01, -0.00) were significant. In the same model, SFAL-WP (Coeff: 0.09, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.15), SFAL-RB (Coeff: -0.14, 95% CI: -0.19, -0.09), and TCF (Coeff: 0.01, 95% CI: 0.00, 0.02) interacted with poverty. Tax by poverty was of borderline significance in this model (Coeff = 0.02, 95% CI: -0.00, 0.04, <i>p</i> = 0.050). Among adults, SFALs, TCF, and tax were associated with less current smoking, and SFALs and TCF had differential relationships with smoking by poverty.","['cigarettes', 'clean indoor air laws', 'policy', 'poverty', 'smokefree air laws', 'smoking', 'tax', 'tobacco control funding']"
Correlation of cardiovascular risk predictors with overweight and obesity in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia.,"We aimed to analyze the correlation between overweight and obesity-related indicators and cardiovascular risk predictors in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) and to evaluate their mutual predictive properties.A total of 103 patients with FH included from 2004 to 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. Pearson correlation analysis and multiple linear regression analysis were used to assess the correlation between overweight and obesity-related indicators and cardiovascular risk predictors in FH patients. Subject operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze their reciprocal predictive performance.(1) Atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) (β = 0.020) and ApoB/ApoA1 Ratio (BAR) (β = 0.015) were independently correlated with body mass index (BMI) (<i>P</i> < 0.05); AIP (β = 1.176) was independently correlated with waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (<i>P</i> < 0.01); AIP (β = 1.575), BAR (β = 0.661) and atherogenic coefficient (AC) (β = 0.427) were independently correlated with waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) (<i>P</i> < 0.05). (2) The area under the ROC (AUC) for overweight corresponding to AIP, BAR, and AC were 0.695 (95% <i>CI</i> = 0.593-0.797, <i>P</i> < 0.01), 0.660 (95% <i>CI</i> = 0.555-0.766, <i>P</i> < 0.01), and 0.632 (95% <i>CI</i> = 0.525-0.740, <i>P</i> < 0.05), respectively; and AUCs for central obesity corresponding to AIP, BAR and AC were 0.757 (95% <i>CI</i> = 0.656-0.857, <i>P</i> < 0.001), 0.654 (95% <i>CI</i> = 0.536-0.771, <i>P</i> < 0.05) and 0.651 (95% <i>CI</i> = 0.538-0.764, <i>P</i> < 0.05), respectively. The AUCs for moderate risk of AIP corresponding to BMI, WHR, and WHtR were 0.709 (95% <i>CI</i> = 0.608-0.811, <i>P</i> < 0.001), 0.773 (95% <i>CI</i> = 0.678-0.867, <i>P</i> < 0.001), 0.739 (95% <i>CI</i> = 0.641-0.836, <i>P</i> < 0.001), respectively, and BMI, WHR and WHtR corresponded to an AUC of 0.691 (95% <i>CI</i> = 0.585-0.797, <i>P</i> < 0.01), 0.734 (95% <i>CI</i> = 0.632-0.835, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and 0.706 (95% <i>CI</i> = 0.603-0.810, <i>P</i> < 0.01) for high risk of AIP, respectively.AIP has independent positive linear correlation with indicators related to overweight and obesity in FH patients; AIP has good predictive performance for overweight and obesity in FH patients, and WHR has good performance for identifying moderate and high risk of AIP in FH patients.","['atherogenic', 'cardiovascular', 'correlation', 'hypercholesterolemia', 'obesity']"
Associations between Training Load and Well-Being in Elite Beach Soccer Players: A Case Report.,"The current case study aimed to quantify within-subjects correlations between training load and well-being in elite male beach soccer players. Data were obtained over three consecutive days during the preparation camp for the FIFA Beach Soccer World Cup Russia 2021. The session rating of perceived exertion (s-RPE) and external training load metrics using global positioning system (GPS) were recorded. Eleven players reported perceived well-being (sleep quality, fatigue, muscle soreness and stress) using a Likert scale (Hooper Index) before breakfast. Within-subjects correlation coefficients between workload and well-being were calculated. Workload metrics and perceived well-being indices were significantly lower on day three than on days one and two. The Hooper Index presented a <i>very large</i> positive correlation with s-RPE (<i>r</i> = 0.86 [0.67, 0.94], 95% confidence interval, CI), exposure time (<i>r</i> = 0.88 [0.71, 0.95]), total distance (<i>r</i> = 0.83 [0.60, 0.93]), high-speed distance (<i>r</i> = 0.77 [0.50, 0.91]), and number of sprints (<i>r</i> = 0.75 [0.47, 0.90]). Sleep quality presented a <i>moderate</i> to <i>large</i> positive correlation with s-RPE (<i>r</i> = 0.51 [0.11, 0.77]), exposure time (<i>r</i> = 0.50 [0.10, 0.76]), high-speed distance (<i>r</i> = 0.53 [0.15, 0.78]), number of sprints (<i>r</i> = 0.62 [0.28, 0.83]) and total distance (<i>r</i> = 0.41 [0.18, 0.78]). Fatigue presented a <i>large</i> to <i>very large</i> positive correlation with s-RPE (<i>r</i> = 0.85 [0.66, 0.94]), exposure time (<i>r</i> = 0.90 [0.78, 0.96]), total distance (<i>r</i> = 0.86 [0.68, 0.94]), high-speed distance (<i>r</i> = 0.65 [0.31, 0.84]) and number of sprints (<i>r</i> = 0.56 [0.18, 0.79]). Muscle soreness presented a <i>large</i> to <i>very large</i> positive correlation with s-RPE (<i>r</i> = 0.79 [0.56, 0.91]), exposure time (<i>r</i> = 0.83 [0.62, 0.93]), total distance (<i>r</i> = 0.81 [0.59, 0.92]), high-speed distance (<i>r</i> = 0.75 [0.47, 0.89]) and number of sprints (<i>r</i> = 0.59 [0.22, 0.81]). Overall, workload presented a meaningful correlation with perceived well-being indices in elite male beach soccer players during a training camp. These findings suggest that workload metrics and perceived well-being indices can be implemented into the daily routine of an elite beach soccer team, which may assist coaches, sports scientists, and practitioners in better preparing players for beach soccer competitions.","['football', 'performance', 'team sports', 'training monitoring']"
Perceived Environmental Attributes: Their Impact on Older Adults' Mental Health in Malaysia.,"In Malaysia, the population of older adults will increase in the coming years. In this context, there is a requirement to build an age-friendly environment to enable the elderly to age healthily. Many studies have shown that a built environment that allows older adults to age in place improves their mental health. However, person-environment analysis that considers mental well-being has remained rare for older adults living in Malaysia. This study examines the relationship between Malaysian seniors' perceptions of their surroundings at home and in the neighborhood and their mental health. Using stratified sampling, 510 seniors aged 60 and over were interviewed. The results showed that accessibility (<i>p</i>-value 0.033, 95% CI for coefficients 0.006, 0.146), environmental qualities (0.015, 0.014, 0.129) and neighborhood problems (0.000, -0.299, -0.146) were significant determinants of elderly people's mental health. With respect to respondents' socio-demographic characteristics, female elderly (0.000, 0.616, 0.782), older adults with an elementary education (0.000, 0.263, 0.685) or a college degree (0.026, 0.019, 0.294), being married (0.005, 0.047, 0.259), the ability to drive (0.000, 0.993, 1.315), the number of dependents in the family (0.003, -0.060, -0.012), and homeownership (0.000, -0.602, -0.271) were significantly related to mental well-being.","['Malaysia', 'environmental attributes', 'healthrelated quality of life', 'urban']"
The effects of N-acetylcysteine supplement on metabolic parameters in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disease, often accompanied by metabolic disorders. Metformin, as an insulin sensitizer, is widely used to improve the metabolic function of PCOS, but may have gastrointestinal side effects. Emerging evidence suggests that N-acetylcysteine (NAC) improves metabolic parameters in PCOS and may be a potential alternative to metformin.We searched four online databases, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library, from inception to April 1, 2023. The <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> statistic and Cochrane's Q test were employed to determine heterogeneity between studies, with an <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> value >50% or <i>p</i> < 0.1 considered significant. The data were expressed as standardized mean differences and corresponding 95% confidence intervals.A total of 11 randomized controlled trials were included in the final analysis, including 869 women with PCOS. The results showed that NAC caused more changes in body mass index (SMD: -0.16, 95% CI: -0.40 to 0.08), body weight (SMD: -0.25, 95% CI: -0.50 to 0.00), fasting insulin (SMD: -0.24, 95% CI: -0.53 to 0.06), ratio of fasting blood glucose to fasting insulin (SMD: 0.38, 95% CI: -0.33 to 1.08), total cholesterol (SMD: -0.11, 95% CI: -0.39 to 0.17), triglycerides (SMD: -0.18, 95% CI: -0.63 to 0.28), and low-density lipoprotein (SMD: -0.09, 95% CI: -0.51 to 0.33) compared with metformin. Compared with metformin or placebo, NAC significantly reduced fasting blood-glucose levels (SMD: -0.23, 95% CI: -0.43 to -0.04; SMD: -0.54, 95% CI: -1.03 to -0.05, respectively). In addition, NAC significantly reduced total cholesterol (SMD: -0.74, 95% CI: -1.37 to -0.12), and this effect was observed when NAC was compared with placebo. However, NAC reduced HDL levels in women with PCOS compared with metformin (SMD: -0.14, 95% CI: -0.42 to 0.14).This study suggests that NAC is effective in improving metabolic parameters in PCOS and may be a promising nutritional supplement for the treatment of PCOS.<b>Systematic review registration:</b>https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=415172, identifier CRD42022339171.","['Nacetylcysteine', 'metaanalysis', 'metabolic parameters', 'nutritional supplementation', 'polycystic ovary syndrome']"
"The Legend score synthesizes Wells, PERC, Geneva, D-dimer and predicts acute pulmonary embolism prior to imaging tests.","The prediction rules of acute pulmonary embolism(PE) before imaging tests recommended by the commonly used guidelines have low diagnostic efficiency if not combined with D-dimer, therefore it is necessary to seek for a prediction rule with higher diagnostic efficiency.We designed a new score named Legend by synthesizing the scores of Wells, PERC, and Geneva, as well as D-dimer with patients in the development group(n = 2112), and then validated it in patients of validation group(n = 388). Diagnostic efficiency was also compared between Legend score and Wells+D-dimer (DD), PERC+DD, Geneva+DD, and YEARS+DD(YEAR algorithm).The Legend score comprised active cancer, D-dimer≥1000 ng/mL, DVT symptoms and/or signs, previous venous thromboembolism (VTE) history, and surgery, trauma, or immobilization in the past month. The sensitivity, specificity, Youden index, and area under the curve(AUC) were 0.985, 0.744, 0.729, and (0.861[0.796-0.925], P<0.001), respectively, for original Legend score, whereas were 0.982, 0.778, 0.760, and (0.871[0.823-0.920], P<0.001), respectively, for simplified Legend score. The Kappa coefficient and P value of McNemar test were 0.988 and 1.000, respectively, between the original and simplified Legend scores. In the validation group, the sensitivity, specificity, Youden index, and C-index were 0.971, 0.749, 0.720, and (0.838[0.781-0.896], P<0.001), respectively, for the original Legend score, whereas were 0.986, 0.715, 0.701, and (0.816[0.750-0.880], P = 0.001) respectively, for the simplified Legend score. The Kappa coefficient and P value of McNemar test between original Legend score and Wells+DD, PERC+DD, Geneva+DD, and YEARS+DD were (0.563, 0.001), (0.139, <0.001), (0.631, 0.006), and (0.732, 0.029), respectively. The Kappa coefficient and P value of McNemar test between simplified Legend score and aforementioned scores were (0.675, 0.009), (0.172, <0.001), (0.747, 0.001), and (0.883, 0.012), respectively.In view of the fact the Legend score reserves the efficient predictors and eliminates the inefficient ones in Wells, PERC, and revised Geneva scores, and incorporates D-dimer into it, a more efficient, modified, and user-friendly one has replaced the original ones.The Legend score yields excellent diagnostic efficiency with good safety in the pretest prediction of acute PE prior to imaging tests. It also avoids more unnecessary imaging tests than Wells+DD, PERC+DD, Geneva+DD, or YEARS+DD.","['Diagnosis', 'Prediction rule', 'Pretest probability', 'Pulmonary embolism', 'Score']"
Qualitative and quantitative study of fetal posterior fossa during the first trimester in a Chinese population.,"To establish the normal reference ranges for parameters related to the fetal posterior fossa in the first trimester (11 ~ 13+6 weeks of gestation) and to analyze the relationship between them and crown-rump length (CRL) among the Chinese population.Singleton pregnancies of 11 ~ 13<sup>+6</sup> weeks (CRL:45 ~ 84 mm) with both parents from China were randomly selected from January 2021 to November 2021. The related parameters of the posterior fossa including cisterna magna (CM), intracranial translucency (IT), brain stem (BS), brain stem to the occipital bone (BSOB), and brain stem/brain stem to occipital bone (BS/BSOB) were evaluated and measured in nuchal translucency (NT) mid-sagittal section clearly by an experienced sonographer (operator 1). To assess the reproducibility of the measurements, we randomly selected 50 pregnant women. According to the blind method, operators 1 and 2 respectively screened and measured relevant parameters. In addition, operator 1 examined and measured relevant parameters again 2 h after the first.This study included 1663 fetuses. All fetuses can clearly show the three spaces of the fetal posterior fossa. The ICCs (95% CI) of intra-operator reproducibility of CM, IT, BS, BSOB, BS/BSOB were 0.981 (0.952 ~ 0.991, P < 0.001), 0.929 (0.866 ~ 0.961, P < 0.001), 0.970 (0.946 ~ 0.983, P < 0.001), 0.991 (0.974 ~ 0.996, P < 0.001), 0.939 (0.892 ~ 0.965, P < 0.001), respectively; The ICCs (95% CI) of inter-operator reproducibility 0.926 (0.860 ~ 0.960, P < 0.001), 0.810 (-0.083 ~ 0.940, P < 0.001), 0.820 (0.645 ~ 0.904, P < 0.001), 0.804 (0.656 ~ 0.888, P < 0.001), 0.772 (0.599 ~ 0.871, P < 0.001), respectively. There was a linear correlation between CRL and the parameters related to the posterior fossa (CM, IT, BS, BSOB, BS/BSOB). CM (mm) = -1.698 + 0.532 × CRL (cm) (r = 0.829, P < 0.001); IT (mm) = 0.701 + 0.179 × CRL (cm) (r = 0.548, P < 0.001); BS (mm) = 0.403 + 0.349 × CRL (cm) (r = 0.716, P < 0.001); BSOB (mm) = -0.277 + 0.719 × CRL (cm) (r = 0.829, P < 0.001); BS/BSOB = 0.747-0.021 × CRL (cm) (r = 0.196, P < 0.001).Qualitative and quantitative assessment of the fetal posterior fossa structure was feasible in the first trimester. We constructed the normal reference ranges of CM, IT, BS, BSOB, and BS/BSOB. Furthermore, CM, IT, BS, and BSOB were positively correlated with CRL, but BS/BSOB was negatively correlated with CRL.","['Fetal posterior fossa', 'First trimester', 'Parameters']"
Effects of exercise training on depression in patients with heart failure: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"The aim of this review is to assess the effects of exercise training on the symptoms of depression in heart failure (HF) patients.Randomized controlled trials of exercise training in patients with HF and symptoms of depression were identified. The depression data were pooled using meta-analysis, and 19 studies were identified, with a total of 3447 patients, of which 16 (3226 patients) provided data for the meta-analysis. Exercise training demonstrated significant reductions in the symptoms of depression [standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.38, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.55 to -0.21], and its antidepressive effect was consistent in a number of HF groups, such as in ages under and over 65 years (SMD -0.14, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.07 vs. SMD -0.44, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.27) and EFs of <50% (SMD -0.38, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.20), as well as in a range of interventional strategies, including the aerobic mode (SMD -0.40, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.19), centre, home, or combined setting (SMD -0.61, 95% CI -0.95 to -0.27 vs. SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.44 to -0.07 vs. SMD -0.13, 95% CI -0.21 to -0.05), and short or longer training programmes (≤12 weeks, SMD -0.50, 95% CI -0.73 to -0.27; 12-26 weeks, SMD -0.47, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.11; >26 weeks, SMD -0.12, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.04). The beneficial effects were preserved when blind design trials were considered (SMD -0.14, 95% CI -0.22 to -0.07).Exercise training significantly decreased the symptoms of depression in patients with HF. This benefit remained unclear in cases of HF with a normal EF and combined aerobic and strength training. Random controlled trials are needed to verify the benefit of exercise in these populations, and in very old, asymptomatic, and severe HF patients.","['Exercise training', 'Heart failure', 'Metaanalysis', 'Symptoms of depression']"
Reliability of detection of ultrasound and MRI features of hand osteoarthritis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To systematically review the literature on inter- and intra-rater reliability of scoring US and MRI changes in hand OA.MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINHAL, Web of Science and AMED were searched from inception to January 2020. Kappa (κ), weighted kappa (κw) and intra-class correlation coefficients for dichotomous, semi-quantitative and summated scores, respectively, and their 95% CI were pooled using a random-effects model. Heterogeneity between studies was assessed and reliability estimates were interpreted using the Landis-Koch classification.Fifty studies met the inclusion criteria (29 US, 17 MRI, 4 involving both modalities). The pooled κ (95% CI) for inter-rater reliability was substantial for US-detected osteophytes [0.66 (0.54, 0.79)], grey-scale synovitis [0.64 (0.32, 0.97)] and power Doppler [0.76, (0.47, 1.05)], whereas intra-rater reliability was almost perfect for osteophytes [0.82 (0.80, 0.84)], central bone erosions (CBEs) [0.83 (0.78, 0.89)] and effusion [0.83 (0.74, 0.91)], and substantial for grey-scale synovitis [0.64 (0.49, 0.79)] and power Doppler [0.70 (0.59, 0.80)]. Inter-rater reliability for dichotomous assessment was substantial for MRI-detected CBEs [0.75 (0.67, 0.83)] and synovitis [0.69 (0.51, 0.87)], slight for osteophytes [0.14 (0.04, 0.25)], and almost perfect for sum score of osteophytes, CBEs, joint space narrowing (JSN), and bone marrow lesions (BMLs) (0.81-0.89). Intra-rater reliability was almost perfect for sum score of MRI synovitis [0.92 (0.87, 0.96)], BMLs [0.88 (0.78, 0.98)], osteophytes [0.86 (0.74, 0.98)], CBEs [0.83 (0.66, 1.00)] and JSN [0.91 (0.87, 0.91)].US and MRI are reliable in detecting hand OA features. US may be preferred due to low cost and increasing availability.","['MRI', 'US', 'interrater', 'intrarater', 'reliability']"
Impacts of grandparenting on older Chinese adults' mental health: a cross-sectional study.,"The practice of grandparenting has been growing in popularity worldwide, particularly in Asian societies. Nevertheless, there is a lack of thorough studies investigating the mental health effects of grandchild care on grandparents, particularly within the family context. The present study aimed to explore the impact of grandparenting on depressive symptoms in older Chinese adults, taking into account the functional role of intergenerational support.Using the China Longitudinal Aging Social Survey (CLASS, 2014 and 2018, N = 9,486), we employed the Pooled Ordinary Least Square method (POLS) to explore the association between depressive symptoms and grandparenting intensity as well as include the interaction terms to investigate the role of intergenerational support among grandparents aged from 60 to 80.After adjusting for control variables, both non-intensive (-0.17; 95% CI: -0.30, -0.03) and intensive (-0.69; 95% CI: -0.95, -0.43) childcare, as well as giving financial support to adult children (-0.06; 95% CI: -0.08, -0.04) and emotional closeness with them (-0.94; 95% CI: -1.15, -0.72), were found to have a positive impact on the mental health of grandparents. Giving financial support (non-intensive: -0.04, 95% CI: -0.07, -0.01; intensive: -0.06, 95% CI: -0.13, -0.01) and providing instrumental support to adult children (non-intensive: -0.12, 95% CI: -0.24, -0.01; intensive: -0.19, 95% CI: -0.37, -0.02) moderated the association between grandparenting and the mental health of older adults, regardless of care intensity. However, the moderating role of receiving financial support (-0.07; 95% CI: -0.12, -0.02) only existed when non-intensive childcare was provided.Grandchild care predicted better mental health in grandparents, mainly when they engaged in intensive grandparenting. Emotional closeness and providing financial support to adult children brought mental health benefits to grandparents involved in childcare. Giving financial support and providing instrumental support to adult children moderated the association between grandparenting and the mental health of older adults. However, the moderating role of receiving financial support from adult children only existed when non-intensive childcare was provided.","['China', 'Crosssectional data', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Grandparenting', 'Intergenerational support']"
Histopathological changes in myocardial tissue due to coronary venous hypertension.,"In chronic venous insufficiency (CVI), an increase in venous pressure causes the passage of intravascular blood cells and molecules into the surrounding tissues and induces histopathological changes in the lower extremities, leading to increased pigmentation in the legs, ulceration, and tissue loss to various degrees. This study aimed to investigate whether an increase in venous pressure in the coronary veins can lead to the aforementioned histopathological changes.Twenty-four New Zealand rabbits were divided into the following three groups: experimental model of coronary venous hypertension (CVH) (<i>n</i> = 8), sham group (<i>n</i> = 8), and control group (<i>n</i> = 8). After 21 days postoperatively, tissue samples from each group were compared for perivascular inflammation, erythrocyte extravasation, macrophage infiltration, and hemosiderin deposits by histopathological scoring under a light microscope. Matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) activation was evaluated using immunohistochemical staining.In the CVH group, hemosiderin accumulation was significantly higher than in the sham and control groups (1.0 (1.0-3.0), 0.0 (0.0-1.0), 0.0 (0.0-0.0); <i>p</i> < 0.001). Immunohistochemically, in the CVH group, MMP-2 levels were significantly higher than in the sham and control groups (2.0 (1.0-3.0), 0.0 (0.0-1.0), 0.0 (0.0-0.0); <i>p</i> < 0.001).This experimental study showed for the first time the histopathological and immunohistochemical changes in myocardial tissue, similar to those observed in CVI, as a result of increased coronary venous pressure due to coronary vein ligation. Further studies are needed to understand the clinical implications of these results.","['Thebesian valve', 'coronary veins', 'hemosiderin', 'vein occlusion', 'venous insufficiency']"
Longitudinal associations between sex hormone-binding globulin and insulin resistance.,"We aimed to investigate the association between SHBG and the homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-Ir) in men and women in a prospective observational study.The Vara-Skövde cohort is a random population of 2816 participants living in southwestern Sweden, aged 30-74. It was recruited between 2002 and 2005, and followed up in 2012-2014. After excluding participants on insulin therapy or hormone replacement therapy, 1193 individuals (649 men, 544 women) were included in the present study. Fasting blood samples were collected at both visits and stored in biobank. All participants were physically examined by a trained nurse. SHBG was measured with immunoassay technique. Linear regressions were computed to investigate the association between SHBG and HOMA-Ir both in cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses, adjusting for confounding factors.The mean follow-up time was 9.7 ± 1.4 years. Concentrations of SHBG were significantly inversely associated with log transformed HOMA-Ir in all groups with estimated standardized slopes (95% CI): men: -0.20 (-0.3;-0.1), premenopausal women: -0.26 (-0.4;-0.2), postmenopausal women: -0.13 (-0.3;-0.0) at visit 1. At visit 2 the results were similar. When comparing the groups, a statistically significant difference was found between men and post-menopausal women (0.12 (0.0;0.2) P value = 0.04). In the fully adjusted model, SHBG at visit 1 was also associated with HOMA-Ir at visit 2, and the estimated slopes were -0.16 (-0.2;-0.1), -0.16 (-0.3;-0.1) and -0.07 (-0.2;0.0) for men, premenopausal and postmenopausal women, respectively.Levels of SHBG predicted the development of insulin resistance in both men and women, regardless of menopausal state.","['cohort studies', 'insulin resistance', 'prediabetes', 'prospective studies', 'sex hormonebinding globulin', 'sex hormones']"
Algorithm for Schroth-Curve-Type Classification of Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis: An Intra- and Inter-Rater Reliability Study.,"Schroth exercises for scoliosis are prescribed based on curve types. This study aimed to determine the reliability of an algorithm for classifying Schroth curve types. Forty-four consecutive volunteers with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, 10 to 18 years old, with curves 10° to 50°, were recruited from a scoliosis clinic. Their standing posture and Adam's bending test were videotaped. Ten consecutive Schroth therapist volunteers from an international registry independently classified the curve types using the proposed classification algorithm. Videos were rated twice at least seven days apart. Reliability was calculated using the Gwet's AC1 agreement coefficient for all the raters and for subgroups reporting full understanding (well-trained) and with prior algorithm experience. The intra-rater and weighted agreement coefficients for all the raters were 0.64 (95% CI: 0.53-0.73) and 0.75 (0.63-0.84), respectively. For the well-trained raters, they were 0.70 (0.60-0.78) and 0.82 (0.73-0.88), respectively; for the experienced raters, they were 0.81 (0.77-0.85) and 0.89 (0.80-0.94), respectively. The inter-rater versus weighted agreement coefficients for all the raters were 0.43 (0.28-0.58) versus 0.48 (0.29-0.67). For the well-trained raters, they were 0.50 (0.38-0.61) versus 0.61 (0.49-0.72), and for the experienced raters, they were 0.67 (0.50-0.85) versus 0.79 (0.64-0.94). Full understanding and experience led to higher reliability. Use of the algorithm can help standardize Schroth exercise treatment.","['Schroth', 'adolescent', 'algorithms', 'classification', 'posture', 'reliability', 'reproducibility of results', 'scoliosis']"
"LncRNA TM1-3P Regulates Proliferation, Apoptosis and Inflammation of Fibroblasts in Osteoarthritis through miR-144-3p/ONECUT2 Axis.","This study explores LncRNA TM1-3P effects on the proliferation, apoptosis, and inflammatory response of fibroblasts in osteoarthritis (OA) and its underlying mechanism.Bioinformatics was performed to analyze OA disease-related genes, miRNA profiles, and function. The targeted regulation of LncRNA TM1-3P and miR-144-3p, ONECUT2 and miR-144-3p were analyzed by dual luciferase reporter gene assay, RNA Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation (RIP), and RNA pull down. Histopathological morphology of the knee joint was observed by hematoxylin-eosin (HE) and Annona Red O/Fast Green. The expressions of mRNAs and proteins were detected by RT-qPCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemistry. Unpaired T test was used between groups, and the one-way analysis of variance of repeated measurement data was applied for multi-group comparison, following Tukey's post-test.ONECUT2 and Smurf2 genes were significantly elevated in the osteoarthritis group compared with the normal group (P < 0.001, P < 0.001). Expressions of ONECUT2 and LncRNA TM1-3P were increased, and expression of miR-144-3p was decreased in interleukin (IL)-1β-induced human fibroblast synovial cells (hFSCs) (mRNA: 1.06 ± 0.24 vs. 3.29 ± 0.73, proteins: 0.22 ± 0.03 vs. 0.46 ± 0.22, 1.23 ± 0.22 vs. 3.76 ± 0.73, 1.06 ± 0.25 vs. 0.37 ± 0.13, P < 0.01, P < 0.001, P < 0.01, P < 0.05). Overexpression of miR-144-3p down-regulated the ONECUT2 expression, reduced cell proliferation, promoted apoptosis in hFSCs induced by IL-1β (mRNA: 0.89 ± 0.14 vs. 0.15 ± 0.01, P < 0.05; proteins: 0.46 ± 0.01 vs. 0.23 ± 0.01, P < 0.001; CCK8: 1.88 ± 0.07 vs. 1.65 ± 0.07; P < 0.05; EDU: 55.82 ± 1.44 vs 40.57 ± 2.24, P < 0.05; apoptosis: 10.57 ± 0.79 vs 16.36 ± 0.35, P < 0.0001). Overexpression of LncRNA TM1-3P up-regulated the expression of ONECUT2, promoted cell proliferation, and inhibited apoptosis (mRNA: 0.9 ± 0.09 vs 1.94 ± 0.12, P < 0.05; proteins: 0.61 ± 0.05 vs 0.76 ± 0.03, P > 0.05; CCK8: 2.07 ± 0.05 vs 2.47 ± 0.06; P < 0.01; EDU: 52.67 ± 1.17 vs 60.06 ± 3.24, P < 0.05; apoptosis: 10.57 ± 0.79 vs 16.36 ± 0.35, P < 0.001), which were reversed by the overexpression of miR-144-3p treatment (mRNA: 1.82 ± 0.07 vs 0.31 ± 0.07, P < 0.0001; proteins: 0.74 ± 0.02 vs 0.35 ± 0.01, P < 0.01; CCK8: 2.41 ± 0.01 vs 1.67 ± 0.02; P < 0.0001; EDU: 66.85 ± 2.86 vs 44.68 ± 1.97, P < 0.0001; apoptosis: 7.19 ± 0.19 vs 13.36 ± 0.53, P < 0.0001). Silencing LncRNA TM1-3P attenuated the injury of knee joint tissue, down-regulated the expression of ONECUT2, Smurf2, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and improved the expression of Rap1 in rats (0.71 ± 0.04 vs 0.48 ± 0.02, 0.68 ± 0.06 vs 0.36 ± 0.02, 0.74 ± 0.03 vs 0.49 ± 0.04, 0.78 ± 0.01 vs 0.54 ± 0.03, 0.68 ± 0.02 vs 0.4 ± 0.04, 0.24 ± 0.01 vs 0.4 ± 0.03, P < 0.05, P < 0.05, P < 0.05, P < 0.01, P < 0.01, P < 0.05).LncRNA TM1-3P improved inflammation and damage of knee joints in OA rats through miR-144-3p/ONECUT2 axis, providing a new theoretical basis for gene therapy of OA.","['Inflammation', 'LncRNA TM13P', 'ONECUT2', 'Osteoarthritis', 'miR1443p']"
Spatio-temporal image correlation (STIC) in evaluation of advanced neuroendocrine tumours.,"4D Ultrasound technology merging the Power Doppler option called High-Definition Flow (HDF) with Spatio-Temporal Image Correlation (STIC) is used in gynaecology and obstetrics. It seems to be a promising tool in assessing tissue vascularisation. The aim of the paper was to assess whether HDF STIC technique could be a useful tool for the evaluation of gastro-entero-pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasm (GEP-NEN) advancement.Forty-eight patients [mean age 57.7 ± 10.3 years; male 40.9% (n = 18)] diagnosed with metastatic GEP-NENs were included in the analysis. All subjects were enrolled in the Department of Endocrinology and Neuroendocrine Tumours, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice. We analysed liver metastases. Patients with G3 grading or faintly vascularised lesions were excluded. HDF STIC volumes were acquired during USG examination. 4D indices [volumetric pulsatility index (vPI) and volumetric systolic/diastolic index (vS/D)] were calculated using dedicated software.There were no correlations between vS/D and Ki-67 [p = 0.67; r = -0.19; (-0.28-0.19)], CgA [p = 0.47; r = -0.11; (-0.38-0,19)], 5-HIAA [p = 0.52; r = -0.09 (-0.37-0.2)], serotonin [p = 0.83; r = -0.03 (-0.32-0.26)], and VCAM-1 (p = 0.62; r = 0.09 (-03-0.47)]. The were no correlations between vPI and Ki-67 [p = 0.29; r = -0.16 (-0.45-0.14)], CgA (p = 0.46; r = -0.11 (-0.39-0.19)], 5-HIAA [p = 0.52; r = -0.09 (-0.37-0.2)], serotonin [p = 0.82; r = -0.03 (-0.32-0.26)], and VCAM-1 (p = 0.62; r = -0.09 (-03-0.47)]. There was no significant difference between carcinoid versus non-carcinoid patients if compared by vS/D and vPI (p = 0.62, p = 0.61, respectively).HDF STIC seems not to be an efficient marker to assess advancement of NENs, due to lack of correlation with widely used and approved markers of progression.","['HDF', 'NENs', 'STIC', 'fourdimensional sonography', 'metastasis']"
A systematic review and meta-analysis of minimally invasive total mesorectal excision versus transanal total mesorectal excision for mid and low rectal cancer.,"Minimally invasive total mesorectal excision (MiTME) and transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME) are popular trends in mid and low rectal cancer. However, there is currently no systematic comparison between MiTME and TaTME of mid and low-rectal cancer. Therefore, we systematically study the perioperative and pathological outcomes of MiTME and TaTME in mid and low rectal cancer.We have searched the Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, Medline, and Web of Science for articles on MiTME (robotic or laparoscopic total mesorectal excision) and TaTME (transanal total mesorectal excision). We calculated pooled standard mean difference (SMD), relative risk (RR), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The protocol for this review has been registered on PROSPERO (CRD42022374141).There are 11010 patients including 39 articles. Compared with TaTME, patients who underwent MiTME had no statistical difference in operation time (SMD -0.14; CI -0.31 to 0.33; I<sup>2=</sup>84.7%, P=0.116), estimated blood loss (SMD 0.05; CI -0.05 to 0.14; I<sup>2=</sup>48%, P=0.338), postoperative hospital stay (RR 0.08; CI -0.07 to 0.22; I<sup>2=</sup>0%, P=0.308), over complications (RR 0.98; CI 0.88 to 1.08; I<sup>2=</sup>25.4%, P=0.644), intraoperative complications (RR 0.94; CI 0.69 to 1.29; I<sup>2=</sup>31.1%, P=0.712), postoperative complications (RR 0.98; CI 0.87 to 1.11; I<sup>2=</sup>16.1%, P=0.789), anastomotic stenosis (RR 0.85; CI 0.73 to 0.98; I<sup>2=</sup>7.4%, P=0.564), wound infection (RR 1.08; CI 0.65 to 1.81; I<sup>2=</sup>1.9%, P=0.755), circumferential resection margin (RR 1.10; CI 0.91 to 1.34; I<sup>2=</sup>0%, P=0.322), distal resection margin (RR 1.49; CI 0.73 to 3.05; I<sup>2=</sup>0%, P=0.272), major low anterior resection syndrome (RR 0.93; CI 0.79 to 1.10; I<sup>2=</sup>0%, P=0.386), lymph node yield (SMD 0.06; CI -0.04 to 0.17; I<sup>2=</sup>39.6%, P=0.249), 2-year DFS rate (RR 0.99; CI 0.88 to 1.11; I<sup>2=</sup>0%, P = 0.816), 2-year OS rate (RR 1.00; CI 0.90 to 1.11; I<sup>2=</sup>0%, P = 0.969), distant metastasis rate (RR 0.47; CI 0.17 to 1.29; I<sup>2=</sup>0%, P = 0.143), and local recurrence rate (RR 1.49; CI 0.75 to 2.97; I<sup>2=</sup>0%, P = 0.250). However, patients who underwent MiTME had fewer anastomotic leak rates (SMD -0.38; CI -0.59 to -0.17; I<sup>2=</sup>19.0%, P<0.0001).This study comprehensively and systematically evaluated the safety and efficacy of MiTME and TaTME in the treatment of mid to low-rectal cancer through meta-analysis. There is no difference between the two except for patients with MiTME who have a lower anastomotic leakage rate, which provides some evidence-based reference for clinical practice. Of course, in the future, more scientific and rigorous conclusions need to be drawn from multi-center RCT research.https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO, identifier CRD42022374141.","['metaanalysis', 'mid and lowrectal cancer', 'minimally invasive total mesorectal excision', 'systematic review', 'transanal total mesorectal excision']"
Correlations of milk and serum element concentrations with production and management traits in dairy cows.,"The present study investigated the potential consequences, positive or negative, that selection for favorable production-related traits may have on concentrations of vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and key chemical elements in dairy cow milk and serum and the possible impact on milk healthiness, and associated benefits, for the dairy product consumer. Milk and serum samples (950 and 755, respectively) were collected from Holstein-Friesian dairy cows (n = 479) on 19 occasions over a 59-mo period, generating 34,258 individual records, and analyzed for concentrations of key trace and quantity elements, heavy metals, and milk vitamin B<sub>12</sub>. These data were then matched to economically important production data (milk, fat, and protein yield) and management data (dry matter intake, liveweight, and body condition score). Multivariate animal models, including full pedigree information, were used to analyze data and investigate relationships between traits of interest. Results highlighted negative genetic correlations between many quantity and trace elements in both milk and serum with production and management traits. Milk yield was strongly negatively correlated with the milk quantity elements Mg and Ca (genetic correlation between traits, r<sub>a</sub> = -0.58 and -0.63, respectively) as well as the trace elements Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, and Mo (r<sub>a</sub> = -0.32, -0.58, -0.52, -0.40, -0.34, and -0.96, respectively); and in serum, Mg, Ca, Co, Fe, and Zn (r<sub>a</sub> = -0.50, -0.36, -0.68, -0.54, and -0.90, respectively). Strong genetic correlations were noted between dry matter intake with V (r<sub>a</sub> = 0.97), Fe (r<sub>a</sub> = -0.69), Ni (r<sub>a</sub> = -0.81), and Zn (r<sub>a</sub> = -0.75), and in serum, strong negative genetic correlations were observed between dry matter intake with Ca and Se (r<sub>a</sub> = -0.95 and -0.88, respectively). Body condition score was negatively correlated with serum P, Cu, Se, and Pb (r<sub>a</sub> = -0.45, -0.35, -0.51, and -0.64, respectively) and positively correlated with Mn, Fe, and Zn (r<sub>a</sub> = 0.40, 0.71, and 0.55, respectively). Our results suggest that breeding strategies aimed at improving economically important production-related traits would most likely result in a negative impact on levels of beneficial nutrients within milk for human consumption (such as Mg, Ca, Fe, Zn, and Se).","['dairy cow', 'heavy metal', 'management data', 'micronutrient', 'production']"
Near-Infrared Reflectance Spectrophotometry (NIRS) Application in the Amino Acid Profiling of Quality Protein Maize (QPM).,"The accurate quantification of amino acids in maize breeding programs is challenging due to the high cost of analysis using High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and other conventional methods. Using the Near-Infrared Spectroscopic (NIRS) method in breeding to screen many genotypes has proven to be a fast, cost-effective, and non-destructive method. Thus, this study aimed to develop and apply the NIRS prediction models for quantifying amino acids in biofortified quality protein maize (QPM). Sixty-three (63) QPM maize genotypes were used as the calibration set, and another twenty (20) genotypes were used as the validation set. The microwave hydrolysis system coupled with post-column derivatization with 6-amino-quinoline-succinimidyl-carbamate as the derivatization reagent and the HPLC method were used to generate the reference data set used for the calibration development. The calibration models were developed for essential and non-essential amino acids using WINSI Foss software. Good coefficients of determination in calibration (R<sup>2</sup><sub>cal</sub>) of 0.91, 0.93, 0.93, and 0.91 and low standard errors in calibrations (SEC) of 0.62, 0.71, 0.26, and 1.75 were obtained for glutamic acids, alanine, proline, and leucine, respectively, while aspartic acids, serine, glycine, arginine, tyrosine, valines, and phenylalanine had fairly good R<sup>2</sup><sub>Cal</sub> values of 0.86, 0.71, 0.81, 0.78, 0.68, 0.79, and 0.75. In contrast, poor (R<sup>2</sup><sub>cal</sub>) was obtained for histidine (0.07), cystine (0.09), methionine (0.09), lysine (0.20), threonine (0.51), and isoleucine (0.09), respectively. The models' prediction performances (R<sup>2</sup><sub>pred</sub>) and standard error of prediction (SEP) were reasonably good for certain amino acids such as aspartic acid (0.90), glycine (0.80), arginine (0.94), alanine (0.90), proline (0.80), tyrosine (0.83), valine (0.82), leucine (0.90), and phenylalanine (0.88) with SEP values of 0.24, 0.39,0.24, 0.93, 0.47,0.34, 0.78, 2.20, and 0.77, respectively. However, certain amino acids had their R<sup>2</sup><sub>pred</sub> below 0.50, which could be improved to become useful for screening purposes for those amino acids. Further work is recommended by including a training set representing the sample population's variance to improve the model's performance.","['HPLC', 'NIRS', 'amino acids', 'calibration', 'model', 'quality protein maize', 'screening', 'validation']"
A Meta-Analysis of Microbial Therapy Against Metabolic Syndrome: Evidence From Randomized Controlled Trials.,"<b>Background and aims:</b> Metabolic syndrome (MetS), accompanied with significant intestinal dysbiosis, causes a great public health burden to human society. Here, we carried out a meta-analysis to qualify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and to systematically evaluate the effect of microbial therapy on MetS. <b>Methods and results:</b> Forty-two RCTs were eligible for this meta-analysis after searching the PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases. Pooled estimates demonstrated that treatment with microbial therapy significantly reduced the waist circumference (WC) (SMD = -0.26, 95% CI -0.49, -0.03), fasting blood glucose (FBG) (SMD = -0.35, 95% CI -0.52, -0.18), total cholesterol (TC) (SMD = -0.36, 95% CI -0.55, -0.17), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (SMD = -0.42, 95% CI -0.61, -0.22), and triacylglycerol (TG)(SMD = -0.38, 95% CI -0.55, -0.20), but increased the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (SMD = 0.28, 95% CI.03, 0.52). Sensitivity analysis indicated that after eliminating one study utilizing <i>Bifidobacteriumlactis</i>, results became statistically significant in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (SMD = -0.24, 95% CI -0.41, -0.07) and in Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (SMD = -0.28, 95% CI -0.54, -0.03), while the body mass index (BMI) showed significant difference after eliminating one study utilizing oat bran (SMD = -0.16, 95% CI -0.31, -0.01). There was still no significant effect in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c%). <b>Conclusion:</b> In patients with MetS, the conditioning with microbial therapy notably improves FBG, TC, TG, HDL-C, LDL-C, WC, BMI (except for the study using oat bran), HOMA-IR, and DBP (except for the Study using <i>Bifidobacteriumlactis</i>), however, with no effect in SBP and in HbA1c%.","['fecal microbiota transplantation', 'metabolic syndrome', 'microbial metabolites', 'prebiotics', 'probiotics', 'synbiotics']"
Exercise intervention and improvement of negative emotions in children: a meta-analysis.,"Anxiety, depression, and stress are the most common mental health problems in childhood. Exercise interventions in childhood help to promote mental health.To investigate the relationship between exercise interventions and improvement of negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and stress in children (5-12 years).Articles were searched in five electronic databases from their inception to January 2023. The meta-analysis was performed using Stata 16.0.Twenty-three intervention studies included 6830 children. 1) The exercise intervention group was significantly better than the control group in improving negative emotions (Standard Mean Difference SMD=-0.25, 95% Confidence Intervals CI: -0.34 to -0.15, P < 0.01). Exercise intervention improved different kinds of negative emotions: anxiety (SMD=-0.19, 95% CI: -0.33 to -0.06, P < 0.01), depression (SMD=-0.22, 95% CI: -0.43 to -0.01, P < 0.01), and stress (SMD=-0.33, 95% CI: -0.53 to -0.14, P < 0.01); it was most effective at relieving problematic stress. Exercise interventions lasting 20-45 min were most effective in improving children's negative emotions (SMD=-0.38, 95% CI: -0.56 to -0.20, P < 0.01). An exercise intervention period of 10 weeks was more effective in improving children's negative mood (SMD=-0.26, 95% CI: -0.34 to -0.17, P = 0.274).Exercise interventions may improve negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and stress in children. These findings may have clinical implications for children with negative affect. However, these studies showed a large heterogeneity, and the results should be interpreted with caution. Future studies should report the variability of exercise interventions by gender, age group, and type, intensity, and place of exercise.","['Children', 'Exercise', 'Metaanalysis', 'Negative emotion']"
Relationship between hippocampal subfield volumes and cognitive decline in healthy subjects.,"We examined the relationship between hippocampal subfield volumes and cognitive decline over a 4-year period in a healthy older adult population with the goal of identifying subjects at risk of progressive cognitive impairment which could potentially guide therapeutic interventions and monitoring. 482 subjects (68.1 years +/- 7.4; 52.9% female) from the Irish Longitudinal Study on Ageing underwent magnetic resonance brain imaging and a series of cognitive tests. Using <i>K</i>-means longitudinal clustering, subjects were first grouped into three separate global and domain-specific cognitive function trajectories; High-Stable, Mid-Stable and Low-Declining. Linear mixed effects models were then used to establish associations between hippocampal subfield volumes and cognitive groups. Decline in multiple hippocampal subfields was associated with global cognitive decline, specifically the presubiculum (estimate -0.20; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.78 - -0.02; <i>p</i> = 0.03), subiculum (-0.44; -0.82 - -0.06; <i>p</i> = 0.02), CA1 (-0.34; -0.78 - -0.02; <i>p</i> = 0.04), CA4 (-0.55; -0.93 - -0.17; <i>p</i> = 0.005), molecular layer (-0.49; -0.87 - -0.11; <i>p</i> = 0.01), dentate gyrus (-0.57; -0.94 - -0.19; <i>p</i> = 0.003), hippocampal tail (-0.53; -0.91 - -0.15; <i>p</i> = 0.006) and HATA (-0.41; -0.79 - -0.03; <i>p</i> = 0.04), with smaller volumes for the Low-Declining cognition group compared to the High-Stable cognition group. In contrast to global cognitive decline, when specifically assessing the memory domain, cornu ammonis 1 subfield was not found to be associated with low declining cognition (-0.14; -0.37 - 0.10; <i>p</i> = 0.26). Previously published data shows that atrophy of specific hippocampal subfields is associated with cognitive decline but our study confirms the same effect in subjects asymptomatic at time of enrolment. This strengthens the predictive value of hippocampal subfield atrophy in risk of cognitive decline and may provide a biomarker for monitoring treatment efficacy.","['MRI', 'cognitive decline', 'dementia', 'hippocampus subfields', 'risk factors']"
The Effects of Asthma on the Association Between Pulmonary Function and Obesity: A 16-Year Longitudinal Study.,"Asthma and obesity are important public health issues around the world. Obesity is considered a risk factor associated with the severity and incidence of asthma. We investigated the relationships between poor pulmonary function (defined by forced vital capacity (FVC) and percentage of predicted FVC (FVC%)) and obesity.This is a retrospective longitudinal study using the MJ health examination database in Taiwan from 2000 to 2015. There were 160,609 participants aged ≥20 years with complete obesity indicators and lung function data, and having at least two visits. A generalized estimation equation (GEE) model was applied to estimate the association between lung function and obesity.BMI was the best indicator to predict poor pulmonary function for our participants. Results of BMI are presented as an example: Obesity (body mass index (BMI) ≥27.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) is significantly associated with lower FVC [adjusted coefficients (β) for asthmatics: -0.11 L (95% CI: -0.14, -0.08); adjusted β for non-asthmatics: -0.08 L (-0.09, -0.08)] and FVC% [adjusted β for asthmatics: -1.91% (95% CI: -2.64, -1.19); adjusted β for non-asthmatics: 1.48% (-1.63, -1.33)]. Annual change of BMI (ΔBMI/year) is an independent risk factor for decreased FVC [adjusted β for asthmatics: -0.030 L (-0.048, -0.013); adjusted β for non-asthmatics: -0.019 L (-0.022, -0.016)] and FVC% [adjusted β for non-asthmatics: -0.603% (-1.063, -0.142); adjusted β for non-asthmatics: -0.304% (-0.393, -0.214)], and is significantly associated with accelerated FVC decline [adjusted β of ΔFVC/year and ΔFVC %/year for asthmatics: -0.038 L (-0.054, -0.022) and -0.873% (-1.312, -0.435); adjusted β of ΔFVC/year and ΔFVC %/year for non-asthmatics: -0.033 L (-0.042, -0.024) and -0.889% (-1.326, -0.452)].Obesity is significantly associated with decreased lung function, and asthmatics had a higher risk than non-asthmatics.","['BMI', 'FVC', 'asthma', 'obesity', 'pulmonary function']"
Meta-analysis of health state utility values measured by EuroQol 5-dimensions (EQ5D) questionnaire in Chinese women with breast cancer.,"To synthesise EQ5D health state utility values in Chinese women with breast cancer for parameterising a cost utility model.Eligible studies had to report health state utility values measured by EQ-5D in Chinese women diagnosed with breast cancer. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS). Data from single arm studies was pooled using meta-analysis of single proportions to provide overall point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for fixed and random effects models using the inverse variance and Der Simonian-Laird methods respectively. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the I<sup>2</sup> statistic and sensitivity analysis and meta-regression were conducted.Five papers were included, when all studies were combined (n = 4,100) the mean utility (95% confidence interval) for random effects model was 0.83 (0.78, 0.89); for TNM 0-1 0.85 (0.75, 0.95); for TNM II 0.85 (0.78, 0.93); for TNM III 0.83 (0.77, 0.90) and for TNM IV 0.73 (0.63, 0.82).The utility of patients in State P (first year after primary breast cancer) 0.84 (0.80, 0.88); in State R (first year after recurrence) 0.73 (0.69, 0.76), in State S (second and following years after primary breast cancer or recurrence) 0.88 (0.83, 0.92); and in State M (metastatic disease) 0.78 (0.74, 0.82). Mean utility for duration since diagnosis 13 to 36 months was 0.88 (0.80, 0.96, I<sup>2</sup> =95%); for 37 to 60 months 0.89 (0.82, 0.96, I<sup>2</sup> =90%); for more than 60 months 0.86 (0.76, 0.96, I<sup>2</sup> =90%). Mean utility for chemotherapy was 0.86 (0.79, 0.92, I<sup>2</sup> =97%); for radiotherapy 0.83 (0.69, 0.96, I<sup>2</sup> =97%); surgery 0.80 (0.69, 0.91, I<sup>2</sup> =98%); concurrent chemo-radiation 0.70 (0.60, 0.81, I<sup>2</sup> =86%) and endocrine therapy 0.90 (0.83, 0.97, I<sup>2</sup> =91%).This study synthesises the evidence for health state utility values for Chinese women with breast cancer which is useful to inform cost utility models.","['China', 'EQ5D', 'breast cancer', 'evidence synthesis', 'health state utility value', 'metaanalysis']"
Satisfaction with Medications Prescribed for Osteoarthritis: A Cross-Sectional Survey of Patients and Their Physicians in the United States.,"Satisfaction with medications prescribed for osteoarthritis (OA) varies; this study aimed to determine the factors associated with satisfaction in US patients and their physicians.This point-in-time study used the Adelphi OA Disease Specific Programme (physicians identified from public lists reported on nine consecutive patients diagnosed with OA [any joint]: physicians and patients completed questionnaires). Patient's demographic, clinical, and treatment characteristics associated with patient-reported and physician-rated overall satisfaction with, and expectations of effectiveness of, medication for OA were assessed using multivariate linear regression.Responses from 572 patients (mean age 64.9 years, 60.5% female) currently prescribed medication for OA and 153 physicians (81 primary care, 35 rheumatologists, 37 orthopedic surgeons) were analyzed. Pain intensity was moderate or severe for 59.4% of patients. Greater patient-reported overall satisfaction with medication was significantly associated with (standardized beta, 95% confidence interval) exercise (0.12, 0.03-0.20), comorbid other musculoskeletal or painful conditions (vs none) (0.15, 0.06-0.24), and physicians' report that the best control had been achieved (0.12, 0.03-0.20); lack of efficacy was among factors associated with worse satisfaction. Greater patient-reported expectation of effectiveness was significantly associated with exercise (0.12, 0.03-0.21) and the most troublesome joint not being a knee, hip, or their back (0.08, 0.01-0.14). Greater physician-rated overall satisfaction with medication was significantly associated with their report that the best control had been achieved (0.18, 0.11-0.26), the most troublesome joint being a knee (0.08, 0.01-0.14), comorbid other musculoskeletal or painful conditions (0.07, 0.01-0.12), obesity (0.06, 0.00-0.11), and female patients (0.06, 0.00-0.11); lack of efficacy and adverse events/tolerability issues were among factors associated with worse satisfaction. For physicians, their report that the best control had been achieved (0.19, 0.11-0.27), the most troublesome joint being a knee (0.08, 0.00-0.15), improving (vs stable) OA (0.15, 0.07-0.24), and uncertain duration of OA (0.11, 0.02-0.21) were associated with greater perception that the medication was meeting patients' efficacy expectations.Although efficacy was strongly associated with both patients' and physicians' satisfaction with medication, other factors were also important, including exercise (for patients), tolerability (for physicians), and knee OA (for physicians).","['Analgesics', 'Patient satisfaction', 'Prescription analgesic medication', 'Realworld clinical practice', 'Treatment satisfaction']"
Association between Age at <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> Eradication and the Risk of Gastric Cancer Stratified by Family History of Gastric Cancer: A Nationwide Population-Based Study.,"This study compares the risk of GC according to age at <i>H. pylori</i> eradication, stratified based on the presence of family history of GC using a population-based large cohort.We analyzed individuals who underwent GC screening between 2013 and 2014 and received <i>H. pylori</i> eradication therapy before screening.Among 1,888,815 <i>H. pylori</i>-treated patients, 2610/294,706 and 9332/1,594,109 patients with and without a family history of GC, respectively, developed GC. After adjusting for confounders, including age at screening, the adjusted hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) for GC comparison, 70-74, 65-69, 60-64, 55-59, 50-54, 45-49, and <45 years with ≥75 years at <i>H. pylori</i> eradication were 0.98 (0.79-1.21), 0.88 (0.74-1.05), 0.76 (0.59-0.99), 0.62 (0.44-0.88), 0.57 (0.36-0.90), 0.38 (0.22-0.66), and 0.34 (0.17-0.67), respectively, among patients with a family history of GC (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and 1.01 (0.91-1.13), 0.95 (0.86-1.04), 0.86 (0.75-0.98), 0.67 (0.56-0.81), 0.56 (0.44-0.71), 0.51 (0.38-0.68), and 0.33 (0.23-0.47), respectively, among patients without a family history of GC (<i>p</i> < 0.001).In patients with and without a family history of GC, young age at <i>H. pylori</i> eradication was significantly associated with a reduced risk of GC, suggesting that the early treatment of <i>H. pylori</i> infection can maximize GC prevention.","['Helicobacter pylori', 'age', 'eradication', 'gastric cancer']"
Ideal cardiovascular health status and risk of cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality: over a decade of follow-up in the Tehran lipid and glucose study.,"To quantify the association between ideal cardiovascular health (CVH) metrics and incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) including different subtypes [coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, and sudden death], and all-cause mortality in an Iranian population.The study population included 6,388 participants (2,726 men) aged 48.0 ± 12.4 years free of CVD at baseline. We utilized the American Heart Association's 2020 impact target criteria of ideal, intermediate, and poor CVH. The multivariate Cox proportional Hazard model, adjusted for age, sex, educational level, marital status, and family history of CVD, was applied to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) of outcomes per one additional metric of ideal CVH metrics. Furthermore, the risk was also calculated for ideal and intermediate categories considering poor category as a reference.During the median follow-up of 11.26 years, 692 CVD, 589 CHD, 130 stroke, 111 sudden death, and 519 all-cause mortality events were reported. All of the individual ideal CVH metrics were independent predictors except intermediate physical activity level for CVD, BMI < 25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and intermediate physical activity for all-cause mortality. Each additional metrics of ideal CVH decreased the risk by 31 (0.69, 0.65-0.73) for CVD, 32 (0.68, 0.64-0.73) for CHD, 31 (0.69, 0.60-0.80) for stroke, 25 (0.75, 0.64-0.88) for sudden death, and 13% (0.87, 0.81-0.93) for all-cause mortality events. Moreover, intermediate and ideal categories of CVH metrics were associated with lower risk for different CVD outcomes, i.e., 44 (0.56, 0.48-0.65) and 76% (0.24, 0.17-0.35) for CVD; 43 (0.57, 0.47-0.67) and 75% (0.25, 0.16-0.37) for CHD, 58 (0.42, 0.29-0.61) and 86% (0.14, 0.04-0.44) for stroke; 56 (0.44, 0.29-0.66) and 55% (0.45, 0.21-0.99) for sudden death; and 25 (0.75, 0.62-0.90) and 46% (0.54, 0.37-0.80) for all-cause mortality events, respectively. We also assessed the impact of changes in ideal CVH status from phase III to phase IV (2008-2011) on CVD events among 5,666 participants. Accordingly, compared to those remaining in the poor category, all of the changes in ideal CVH categories showed a lower risk for CVD events.Among the Iranian population, meeting higher ideal CVH metrics is associated with a lower risk of different CVD events and mortality outcomes.","['Iranian', 'allcause mortality', 'cardiovascular disease', 'cohort study', 'ideal cardiovascular health']"
Association of grip strength with cardiovascular risk markers.,"Background Mechanisms underlying the association between grip strength and cardiovascular mortality are poorly understood. We aimed to assess the association of grip strength with a panel of cardiovascular risk markers. Design The study was based on a cross-sectional analysis of 3468 adults aged 50-75 years (1891 women) from a population-based sample in Lausanne, Switzerland. Methods Grip strength was measured using a hydraulic hand dynamometer. Cardiovascular risk markers included anthropometry, blood pressure, lipids, glucose, adiposity, inflammatory and other metabolic markers. Results In both genders, grip strength was negatively associated with fat mass (Pearson correlation coefficient: women: -0.170, men: -0.198), systolic blood pressure (women: -0.096, men: -0.074), fasting glucose (women: -0.048, men: -0.071), log-transformed leptin (women: -0.074, men: -0.065), log-transformed high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (women: -0.101, men: -0.079) and log-transformed homocysteine (women: -0.109, men: -0.060). In men, grip strength was also positively associated with diastolic blood pressure (0.068), total (0.106) and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (0.082), and negatively associated with interleukin-6 (-0.071); in women, grip strength was negatively associated with triglycerides (-0.064) and uric acid (-0.059). After multivariate adjustment, grip strength was negatively associated with waist circumference (change per 5 kg increase in grip strength: -0.82 cm in women and -0.77 cm in men), fat mass (-0.56% in women; -0.27% in men) and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (-6.8% in women; -3.2% in men) in both genders, and with body mass index (0.22 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and leptin (-2.7%) in men. Conclusion Grip strength shows only moderate associations with cardiovascular risk markers. The effect of muscle strength as measured by grip strength on cardiovascular disease does not seem to be mediated by cardiovascular risk markers.","['Grip strength', 'Switzerland', 'anthropometry', 'blood pressure', 'glucose', 'inflammation', 'lipids', 'populationbased study']"
The effect of foot orthoses for patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This research quantitatively studied the benefits of foot orthoses for patients with patellofemoral pain syndrome (PFPS) from five aspects: pain intensity, knee function, sport and recreation function, knee symptoms, and knee related quality of life.Potential articles were retrieved using five electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang). The search period was from inception to October 17, 2021.Two researchers independently completed record retrieval and selection, data extraction, and methodological quality assessment. Pooled effect sizes were calculated using a random-effects model or fixed-effect model and a 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Data from six randomized controlled trials (RCT) meeting the inclusion criteria were extracted for meta-analysis with methodological quality assessment scores ranging from seven to ten.Results showed that compared to the control group, foot orthoses can significantly improve knee function (SMD = -0.45[-0.74, -0.16], <i>P</i> = 0.002, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 0%), and improve sport and recreation function (SMD = -0.54[-1.04, -0.03], <i>P</i> = 0.04, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 0%). But the foot orthoses had no significant effect in pain intensity (SMD = -0.01[-0.32, 0.30], <i>P</i> = 0.95, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 64), knee injury symptoms (SMD = -0.36[-0.86, 0.14], <i>P</i> = 0.16, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 0%), and knee related quality of life (SMD = -0.45[-0.95, 0.05], <i>P</i> = 0.08, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 0%).Subgroup analysis of pain intensity showed that foot orthoses had some effect compared to flat/soft inserts (SMD = -0.28[-0.57, 0.00], <i>P</i> = 0.05, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 0%). The effect of other treatments (physiotherapy and gait retraining) was significantly better than that of foot orthoses (SMD = 0.45[0.09, 0.80], <i>P</i> = 0.01, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 46%). Compared with exercise alone, the effect of foot orthoses combined with exercise was more significant (SMD = -0.98[-1.64, -0.32], <i>P</i> = 0.004).The findings suggested that foot orthoses significantly improved knee function and sport and recreation function in patients with PFPS, but had no significant effect on pain intensity, knee injury symptoms, and knee related quality of life. This study supported the positive therapeutic effect of foot orthoses on PFPS.","['Foot orthoses', 'Knee function', 'Metaanalysis', 'Pain intensity', 'Patellofemoral pain syndrome', 'Systematic review']"
Suitability of open-field autorefractors as pupillometers and instrument design effects.,"To determine the agreement and repeatability of the pupil measurement obtained with VIP-200 (Neuroptics), PowerRef II (Plusoptix), WAM-5500 (Grand Seiko) and study the effects of instrument design on pupillometry.Forty patients were measured twice in low, mid and high mesopic. Repeatability was analyzed with the within-subject standard deviation (Sw) and paired <i>t</i>-tests. Agreement was studied with Bland-Altman plots and repeated measures ANOVA. Instrument design analysis consisted on measuring pupil size with PowerRef II simulating monocular and binocular conditions as well as with proximity cues and without proximity cues.The mean difference (±standard deviation) between test-retest for low, mid and high mesopic conditions were, respectively: -0.09 (±0.16), -0.05 (±0.18) and -0.08 (±0.23) mm for Neuroptics, -0.05 (±0.17), -0.12 (±0.23) and -0.17 (±0.34) mm for WAM-5500, -0.04 (±0.27), -0.13 (±0.37) and -0.11 (±0.28) mm for PowerRef II. Regarding agreement with Neuroptics, the mean difference for low, mid and high mesopic conditions were, respectively: -0.48 (±0.35), -0.83 (±0.52) and -0.38 (±0.56) mm for WAM-5500, -0.28 (±0.56), -0.70 (±0.55) and -0.61 (±0.54) mm for PowerRef II. The mean difference of binocular minus monocular pupil measurements was: -0.83 (±0.87) mm; and with proximity cues minus without proximity cues was: -0.30 (±0.77) mm.All the instruments show similar repeat-ability. In all illumination conditions, agreement of Neuroptics with WAM-5500 and PowerRef II is not good enough, which can be partially induced due to their open field design.","['agreement', 'openfield', 'pupil', 'repeatability']"
Crucial laboratory parameters in COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis: An updated meta-analysis.,"Common laboratory parameters are crucial in aiding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case detection. This study aimed to determine the differences between laboratory parameters in (1) COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and (2) severe versus non-severe COVID-19 cases.Studies were collected until March 2020, and retrieved parameters include leukocyte, neutrophil, thrombocyte, and lymphocyte counts in addition to C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and D-dimer levels. In the presence of heterogeneity, the random-effect model (REM) was used instead of the fixed-effect model (FEM).Seven studies in the first analysis showed significantly lower leukocyte, neutrophil and platelet counts in COVID-19 pneumonia (SMD = -0.42, 95%CI -0.60 to -0.25, <i>p</i> < 0.00001, SMD = -0.23, 95%CI -0.41 to -0.06, <i>p</i> = 0.01, SMD = -0.54, 95%CI -0.91 to -0.16, <i>p</i> = 0.0005) compared to non-COVID-19 pneumonia. Twenty-six studies in the second analysis showed significantly lower lymphocyte and thrombocyte counts (SMD = -0.56, 95%CI -0.71 to -0.40, <i>p</i> < 0.0001, SMD = -0.32, 95%CI -0.49 to -0.15, <i>p</i> = 0.0002) and significantly higher leukocyte, neutrophil, D-dimer, and CRP (SMD = 0.31, 95%CI 0.07-0.56, <i>p</i> = 0.01; SMD = 0.44, 95%CI 0.24-0.64, <i>p</i> < 0.0001; SMD = 0.53, 95%CI 0.31-0.75, <i>p</i> < 0.00001; SMD = 0.97, 95%CI 0.70-1.24, <i>p</i> < 0.00001) in severe COVID-19 compared to non-severe COVID-19.In conclusion, thrombocyte count is key in both diagnosis and prognosis. Low leukocyte and neutrophil counts are markers of COVID-19 infection, but contrastingly higher counts indicate progressive COVID-19. And although lymphocyte, D-dimer and CRP levels did not demonstrate diagnostic value, all indicate severity of COVID-19. Confirmation of these findings should be performed in future studies.","['COVID19', 'Diagnosis', 'Laboratory parameters', 'SARSCoV2']"
HER-2 Expression in Colorectal Cancer and Its Correlation with Immune Cell Infiltration.,"This study aimed to investigate the effect of increased HER-2 expression on tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and determine its impact on the prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC) patients; Methods: HER-2, CD4, CD8, CD19, LY6G, CD56, CD68, CD11b, and EpCam expression in CRC tissues and adjacent paracancerous tissues were assessed using multiplex fluorescence immunohistochemical staining. The correlation between HER-2 expression and the number of TILs in CRC tissues was analyzed. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazards models were used to analyze survival outcomes; Results: The expression of HER-2 in tumor tissues was higher than that in paracancerous tissues (1.31 ± 0.45 vs. 0.86 ± 0.20, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Additionally, there was an increase in the numbers of CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, and CD68+ cells in CRC tissues (14.11 ± 1.10 vs. 3.40 ± 0.18, <i>p</i> < 0.005; 0.16 ± 0.12 vs. 0.04 ± 0.04, <i>p</i> < 0.005; 0.71 ± 0.46 vs. 0.25 ± 0.13, <i>p</i> < 0.0005; 0.27 ± 0.24 vs. 0.03 ± 0.11, <i>p</i> < 0.05). An increase in HER-2 expression was positively correlated with an increase in CD4, CD8, and CD19 (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). In HER-2-positive CRC tissues, CD68 expression was increased (0.80 ± 0.55 vs. 0.25 ± 0.22, <i>p</i> < 0.05). In HER-2-upregulated CRC tissues, CD4, CD8, CD19, CD68, CD11b, Ly6G, and CD56 expressions were elevated (0.70 ± 0.37 vs. 0.32 ± 0.17, <i>p</i> = 0.03; 0.22 ± 0.13 vs. 0.09 ± 0.06, <i>p</i> = 0.03; 0.31 ± 0.19 vs. 0.12 ± 0.08, <i>p</i> = 0.02; 1.05 ± 0.62 vs. 0.43 ± 0.21, <i>p</i> < 0.01; 1.34 ± 0.81 vs. 0.53 ± 0.23, <i>p</i> < 0.01; 0.50 ± 0.31 vs. 0.19 ± 0.10, <i>p</i> < 0.01; 1.26 ± 0.74 vs. 0.52 ± 0.24, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Furthermore, increased HER-2 expression was an independent risk factor for recurrence-free survival (RFS) in patients (<i>p</i> < 0.01, HR = 3.421); Conclusions: The increased expression of HER-2 and its relationship with immune cells will provide new insights for immunotherapy in CRC patients.","['HER2', 'colorectal cancer', 'immune cell']"
"Impact of Decentration and Tilt on Spherical, Aberration Correcting, and Specific Aspherical Intraocular Lenses: An Optical Bench Analysis.","The human eye is not optically symmetrical, and very few intraocular lens (IOLs) are perfectly centered in the eye. That is why contrast sensitivity can degrade in some conditions, especially in low light. In an optical bench analysis, we compare spherical (A), aberration correcting (B), and specific aspherical lenses (C) in terms of impact of decentration and tilt on the modulation transfer function as well as the simulated overall quality with USAF test targets.The OptiSpheric IOL PRO2 was used to measure the optical performance of IOLs (A, B, C). In order to assess the optical quality of the IOLs, the optical quality parameters for the aperture size of 3.0 mm and 4.5 mm at the IOL plane were assessed. Through Frequency Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) and Strehl Ratio (SR) values, as well as the ""US Airforce 1951 resolution test chart images"" as qualitative simulation, were analyzed. All measurements (ISO) were repeated and done for centered, decentered (1 mm), and tilted (5°) IOLs.Centered: The MTF (mean) at 50 lp/mm (IOL A, B, C) with 3.0-mm aperture was 0.794/0.716/0.797 (ISO-1 cornea) and 0.673/0.752/0.723 (ISO-2 cornea) and with 4.5-mm aperture 0.728/0.365/0.751 (ISO 1) and 0.276/0.767/0.505 (ISO 2). The SR (mean) with 3.0-mm aperture was 0.763/0.829/0.898 and with 4.5-mm aperture 0.228/0.386/0.432. Decentered by 1 mm: The MTF (mean) at 50 lp/mm with 3.0-mm aperture was 0.779/0.459/0.726 (ISO 1) and 0.695/0.381/0.662 (ISO 2). The MTF (mean) at 50 lp/mm with 4.5-mm aperture was 0.732/0.348/0.653 (ISO 1) and 0.355/0.069/0.346 (ISO 2). The SR (mean) with 3.0-mm aperture was 0.829/0.543/0.397 and with 4.5-mm aperture was 0.259/0.145/0.192. Tilted by 5°: The MTF (mean) at 50 lp/mm with 3.0-mm aperture was 0.731/0.705/0.751 (ISO 1) and 0.623/0.727/0.732 (ISO 2). The MTF (mean) at 50 lp/mm with 4.5-mm aperture was 0.579/0.406/0.701 (ISO 1) and 0.277/0.512/0.429 (ISO 2). The SR (mean) with 3.0-mm aperture was 0.539/0.478/0.514 and with 4.5-mm aperture was 0.262/0.136/0.201.Aberration correcting IOLs perform best when perfectly centered. The optical performance of aberration correcting IOLs can be markedly downgraded by misalignment. The examined ZO optic performed well in decentration and tilt. The ZO concept seems to be a good alternative to aspheric lenses, as it achieves to combine benefits of spherical and aspheric intraocular lenses. There is no perfect IOL, but fitting and choosing the right one for the individual case seems to be crucial to take advantage of benefits and minimize disadvantages. This is why knowledge of optical properties is also mandatory for the surgeon.","['Decentration', 'Monofocal IOL', 'Optical bench', 'Quality of vision', 'Tilt']"
Validation and reproducibility of a FFQ focused on pregnant women living in Northeastern Brazil.,"The aim of the current study is to assess the validity and reproducibility of a FFQ focused on pregnant women living in Northeastern Brazil.Three 24-hour-dietary recalls (24 hR) and two FFQ were applied at 15-d intervals between research stages in order to confirm the validity and reproducibility of the FFQ. Validity assessment was based on Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) or Spearman's correlation coefficient (SCC) between FFQ and the mean of three 24 hR (the 24 hR was used as reference standard), whereas reproducibility assessment was based on the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) among FFQ, and P < 0·05 was set as significance level.Public health network of a capital city in Northeastern Brazil.Overall, 100 pregnant women were included in the study.The PCC or SCC adopted in the validity analysis recorded the recommended values (from 0·4 and 0·7) for energy (0·44; P < 0·001), carbohydrate (0·40; P < 0·001), vitamins B2 (0·40; P < 0·001), B5 (0·40; P < 0·001), E (0·47; P < 0·001), B12 (0·48; P < 0·001), phosphorus (0·92; P < 0·001), Mg (0·81; P < 0·001), Se (0·70; P < 0·001), cholesterol (0·64; P < 0·001), saturated (0·76; P < 0·001), polyunsaturated (0·73; P < 0·001) and monounsaturated fats (0·87; P < 0·001) and fibres (0·77; P < 0·001). Mg (0·72; P < 0·001), Fe (0·65; P < 0·001), lipid (0·56; P < 0·001) and energy (0·55; P < 0·001) presented ICC within the recommended reproducibility values.The FFQ developed in the current study is a useful tool to assess the usual food intake of pregnant women.","['Brazil', 'Food survey', 'Northeastern region', 'Pregnancy', 'Shelf life']"
Reliability and Validation of the Hexoskin Wearable Bio-Collection Device During Walking Conditions.,"To evaluate if the Hexoskin smart shirt (HxS) would produce valid and reliable measurements for heart rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>), step count (SC), and energy expenditure (EE) when compared to a Polar T-31 heart rate monitor, an Applied Electrochemistry Moxus Metabolic System, and a manual step count. A two-day walking treadmill protocol with participants walking for 3 minutes at 3 speeds (1.5mph, 2.5mph, 3.5mph, 0% grade) was performed. Forty-nine volunteers participated the first day, forty-six on the second, thirty-one were used for reliability. Values calculated for the HxS data used Pearson's product-moment correlation (p < 0.05; r ≥ 0.70) for validity and Cronbach's α (≥ 0.70) for reliability. HxS HR (1.5mph; p<0.01, r=0.86, α=0.86. 2.5mph; p<0.01, r=0.81, α=0.88. 3.5mph; p<0.01, r=0.85, α=0.85), HxS RR (1.5mph; p<0.01, r=0.87, α=0.93. 2.5mph; p<0.01, r=0.86, α=0.92. 3.5mph; p<0.01, r=0.71, α=0.76), HxS V<sub>E</sub> (1.5mph; p=0.66, r=0.11, α=0.70. 2.5mph; p=0.01, r=0.15, α=0.73. 3.5mph; p=0.31, r=0.08, α=0.14), HxS SC (1.5mph; p=0.90, r=-0.01, α=0.70. 2.5mph; p=0.22, r=0.13, α=0.86. 3.5mph; p<0.01, r=0.74, α=0.85), HxS EE (1.5mph; p<0.01, r=0.56, α=0.85. 2.5mph; p<0.01, r=0.50, α=0.83. 3.5mph; p<0.01, r=0.51, α=0.80). HxS HR and RR provided valid and reliable measures at all three speeds while V<sub>E</sub>, SC, and EE had a mixture of results based on speed. These results are important in the use of the Hexoskin in an accurate manner for athletes, coaches, and for the potential medical applications being advocated in the field of telemedicine procedures.","['Hexoskin', 'reliability', 'treadmill', 'validity', 'wearable technology']"
The Prevalence of Islet Autoantibodies in Children and Adolescents With Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: A Global Scoping Review.,"Pancreatic islet autoantibodies (iAb) are the hallmark of autoimmunity in type 1 diabetes. A more comprehensive understanding of the global iAb prevalence could help reduce avertible morbidity and mortality among children and adolescents and contribute to the understanding in the observed differences in the incidence, prevalence and health outcomes of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes across and within countries. We present the first scoping review that provides a global synthesis of the prevalence of iAb in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.We searched Ovid MEDLINE<sup>®</sup> with Daily Update, Embase (Elsevier, embase.com) and PubMed (National Library of Medicine -NCBI), for studies pertaining to prevalence in children and adolescents (0-19) with type 1 diabetes published between 1 Jan 1990 and 18 June 2021. Results were synthesized using Covidence systematic review software and meta-analysis was completed using R v3·6·1. Two reviewers independently screened abstracts with a third reviewer resolving conflicts (k= 0·92).The review revealed 125 studies from 48 different countries, with 92 from high-income countries. Globally, in new-onset type 1 diabetes, IA-2A was the most prevalent iAb 0·714 [95% CI (0·71, 0·72)], followed by ICA 0·681 [95% CI (0·67, 0·69)], ZnT8A was 0·654 [95% CI (0·64, 0·66)], GADA 0·636 [95% CI (0·63, 0·66)] and then IAA 0·424 [95% CI (0·42, 0·43)], with substantial variation across world regions. The weighted mean prevalence of IA-2A was more variable, highest in Europe at 0·749 [95% CI (0·74, 0·76)] followed by Northern America 0·662 [95% CI (0·64, 0·69)], Latin America and the Caribbean 0·632 [95% CI (0·54, 0·72)], Oceania 0·603 [95% CI (0·54, 0·67)], Asia 0·466 [95% CI (0·44, 0·50)] and Africa 0·311 [95% CI (0·23, 0·40)]. In established cases of type 1 diabetes, GADA was the most prevalent iAb 0·407 [95% CI (0·39, 0·42)] followed by ZnT8A 0·322 [95% CI (0·29, 0·36)], IA-2A 0·302 [95% CI (0·29, 0·32)], IAA 0·258 [95% CI (0·24, 0·26)] and ICA 0·145 [95% CI (0·13, 0·16)], again with substantial variation across world regions.Understanding the global prevalence of iAb in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes could help with earlier identification of those at-risk of developing type 1 diabetes and inform clinical practice, health policies, resource allocation, and targeted healthcare interventions to better screen, diagnose and manage children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes.","['children and adolescent', 'global', 'global health', 'islet autoantibodies', 'scoping review', 'type 1 diabetes']"
Effects of Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids Supplementation on the Meat Quality of Pigs: A Meta-Analysis.,"Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) supplementation has been widely discussed as a strategy for improving meat quality in pig production, but the effects are inconsistent. This meta-analysis was performed to comprehensively evaluate its effects on the meat quality and growth performance of pigs. We searched the PubMed and the Web of Science databases (articles published from January 1, 2000 to October 16, 2020) and compared PUFAs-supplemented diets with control diets. We identified 1,670 studies, of which 14 (with data for 752 pigs) were included in our meta-analysis. The subgroup analysis was classified as PUFA source [conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) or linseed], concentration (high or low concentration), and initial stage (growing or finishing pigs). Our analysis found that PUFA supplementation increased the intramuscular fat (IMF) content (WMD = 0.467%, 95% CI: 0.312-0.621, <i>p</i> < 0.001), decreased the meat color L<sup>*</sup> (WMD = -0.636, 95% CI: -1.225 to -0.047, <i>p</i> = 0.034), and pH 24 h (WMD = -0.021, 95% CI: -0.032 to -0.009, <i>p</i> < 0.001) but had no influence on drip loss, meat color a<sup>*</sup> and b<sup>*</sup>, pH 45 min, and growth performance. CLA supplementation improved IMF content (WMD = 0.542%, 95% CI: 0.343-0.741, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and reduced meat color b<sup>*</sup> (WMD = -0.194, 95% CI: -0.344 to -0.044, <i>p</i> = 0.011). Linseed supplementation increased IMF content (WMD = 0.307%, 95% CI: 0.047-0.566, <i>p</i> = 0.021), decreased meat color L<sup>*</sup> (WMD = -1.740, 95% CI: -3.267 to -0.213, <i>p</i> = 0.026), and pH 24 h (WMD = 0.034, 95% CI: -0.049 to -0.018, <i>p</i> < 0.001). We discovered an increase on the IMF content in both high and low concentration PUFA supplementation (WMD = 0.461%, 95% CI: -0.344 to -0.044, <i>p</i> < 0.001; WMD = 0.456%, 95% CI: 0.276-0.635, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Furthermore, we also found the effects of PUFA supplementation on meat color L<sup>*</sup> and pH 24 h are concentration- and stage-dependent. PUFA supplementation can improve the meat quality of pigs, which mainly emerges in greatly increasing IMF content.","['conjugated linoleic acid', 'linseed', 'meat quality', 'metaanalysis', 'pig', 'polyunsaturated fatty acids']"
A Case Control Study Evaluating the Relationship between Vitamin K2 Serum Level and Periodontitis.,"Vitamin K2 (VK2) is an essential co-factor for bone metabolism. There is still very little data regarding possible VK2 relation to periodontitis. This study aimed to investigate any potential link between VK2 serum level and the severity of periodontitis in comparison to a control group of healthy individuals. The trial was performed on 100 patients among whom 50 were diagnosed with periodontitis. The patients underwent full clinical periodontal and radiological examination. The VK2 serum level was assessed using the ELISA kit (Gla-type osteocalcin EIA Kit, Takara, Kusatsu). Patients with periodontitis had mean serum levels of VK2 significantly lower (0.27 ± 0.06 nmol/L; <i>p</i> < 0.001) than the control group (0.43 ± 0.09 nmol/L; <i>p</i> < 0.001) regardless of the patient's age or sex. The VK2 serum level decreased with the severity of periodontitis with the lowest level in stage IV of the disease (0.19 ± 0.01 nmol/L; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Also, a significant drop was noticed between the grades of periodontitis. Individuals with localized forms of the disease had significantly lower VK2 levels (0.26 ± 0.006 nmol/L; <i>p</i> < 0.001) in comparison to subjects with generalized periodontitis (0.30 ± 0.01 nmol/L; <i>p</i> < 0.001). The VK2 serum levels were also associated with most of the clinical parameters such as bleeding on probing (-0.805, 95% CI: -0.894 to -0.654, <i>p</i> < 0.001), attachment loss (-0.752, 95% CI: -0.862 to -0.574, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and bone loss (-0.656, 95% CI: -0.801 to -0.439, <i>p</i> < 0.001). In the present study, the VK2 serum level was correlated to periodontitis, and its severity, complexity, extension, and grade. The range of VK2 was decreasing together with the worsening of all clinical parameters of periodontitis.","['periodontitis', 'vitamin K2', 'vitamin K2 serum level']"
Associations between dietary fiber intake and cardiovascular risk factors: An umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials.,"Although several meta-analyses have revealed the beneficial effects of dietary fiber intake on human health, some have reported inconsistent findings. The purpose of this work was to perform an umbrella meta-analysis to evaluate the relevant evidence and elucidate the effect of dietary fiber intake on glycemic control, lipid profiles, systematic inflammation, and blood pressure. Eligible studies were searched in several electronic databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library, up to March 2022. A total of 52 meta-analyses involving 47,197 subjects were identified to assess the pooled effect size. Overall, higher dietary fiber intake was significantly associated with reductions in parameters involving glycemic control, including fasting plasma glucose (ES = -0.55, 95% CI: -0.73, -0.38, <i>P</i> < 0.001), fasting plasma insulin (ES = -1.22, 95% CI: -1.63, -0.82, <i>P</i> < 0.001), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (ES = -0.43, 95% CI: -0.60, -0.27, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (ES = -0.38, 95% CI: -0.50, -0.26, <i>P</i> < 0.001). In terms of lipid profiles, higher dietary fiber intake was associated with significant reductions in the serum level of total cholesterol (ES = -0.28, 95% CI: -0.39, -0.16, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ES = -0.25, 95% CI: -0.34, -0.16, <i>P</i> < 0.001), but not triglycerides (ES = -0.001, 95% CI: -0.006, 0.004, <i>P</i> = 0.759) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (ES = -0.002, 95% CI: -0.004, 0.000, <i>P</i> = 0.087). Higher dietary fiber intake was also significantly associated with improved tumor necrosis factor-alpha serum levels (ES = -0.78, 95% CI: -1.39, -0.16, <i>P</i> = 0.013), while no significant effect was observed for C-reactive protein (ES = -0.14, 95% CI: -0.33, 0.05, <i>P</i> = 0.156). Finally, blood pressure was also significantly improved following higher dietary fiber intake (systolic blood pressure: ES = -1.72, 95% CI: -2.13, -1.30, <i>P</i> < 0.001; diastolic blood pressure: ES = -0.67, 95% CI: -0.96, -0.37, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Subgroup analysis revealed that the study population and type of dietary fiber could be partial sources of heterogeneity. In conclusion, the present umbrella meta-analysis provides evidence for the role of dietary fiber supplementation in the improvement of established cardiovascular risk factors.","['blood pressure', 'dietary fiber', 'glycolipid metabolism', 'inflammation', 'umbrella metaanalysis']"
Genetic and Phenotypic Parameters for Pelt Quality and Body Length and Weight Traits in American Mink.,"Understanding the genetics of fur characteristics and skin size is important for developing effective breeding programs in the mink industry. Therefore, the objectives of this study were to estimate the genetic and phenotypic parameters for pelt quality traits including live grading overall quality (LQU), live grading nap size (LNAP), dried pelt size (DPS), dried pelt nap size (DNAP) and overall quality of dried pelt (DQU), and body length and weight traits, including November body weight (Nov_BW), November body length (Nov_BL), harvest weight (HW) and harvest length (HL) in American mink. Dried pelt quality traits on 1195 mink and pelt quality traits on live animals on 1680 were collected from mink raised at two farms, in Nova Scotia and Ontario. A series of univariate analyses were implemented in ASReml 4.1 software to identify the significance (p < 0.05) of random effects (maternal genetic effects, and common litter effects) and fixed effects (farm, sex, color type, year, and age) for each trait. Subsequently, bivariate models were used to estimate the genetic and phenotypic parameters using ASReml 4.1. Heritability (±SE) estimates were 0.41 ± 0.06 for DPS, 0.23 ± 0.10 for DNAP, 0.12 ± 0.04 for DQU, 0.28 ± 0.06 for LQU, 0.44 ± 0.07 for LNAP, 0.29 ± 0.10 for Nov_BW, 0.28 ± 0.09 for Nov_BL, 0.41 ± 0.07 for HW and 0.31 ± 0.06 for HL. DPS had high positive genetic correlations (±SE) with Nov_BW (0.89 ± 0.10), Nov_BL (0.81 ± 0.07), HW (0.85 ± 0.05) and HL (0.85 ± 0.06). These results suggested that body weight and length measured on live animals in November of the first year were reliable indicators of dried pelt size. DQU had favorable genetic correlations with Nov_BL (0.55 ± 0.24) and HL (0.46 ± 0.20), and nonsignificant genetic correlations with DNAP (0.13 ± 0.25), Nov_BW (0.25 ± 0.25) and HW (0.06 ± 0.20), which made body length traits an appealing trait for selection for increased pelt size. High positive genetic correlation (±SE) was observed between LNAP and DNAP (0.82 ± 0.22), which revealed that nap size measurement on live animals is a reliable indicator trait for dried pelt nap size. However, nonsignificant (p > 0.05) low genetic correlation (±SE) was obtained between LQU and DQU (0.08 ± 0.45), showing that indirect selection based on live grading might not lead to the satisfactory improvement of dried pelt overall quality. The estimated genetic parameters for live grading, dried pelt quality, and body weight and body length traits may be incorporated into breeding programs to improve fur characteristics in Canadian mink populations.","['American mink', 'body size', 'genetic parameters', 'heritability', 'pelt quality']"
"Vaginal, sexual and urinary symptoms following hysterectomy: a multi-centre randomized controlled trial.","Hysterectomy is the most common major gynaecological procedure. The aim of this study was to study vaginal, sexual and urinary symptoms following total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH), non-descent vaginal hysterectomy (NDVH) and total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) in a low resource setting.A multi-centre randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted in two public sector hospitals in Sri Lanka. Participants were patients requiring hysterectomy for non-malignant uterine causes. Exclusion criteria were uterus> 14 weeks, previous pelvic surgery, medical illnesses which contraindicated laparoscopic surgery, and those requiring incontinence surgery or pelvic floor surgery.Vaginal, sexual function and urinary symptoms were assessed by the validated translations of ICIQ-VS and ICIQ-FLUTS questionnaires. Post-operative improvement (pre-operative - post-operative) was assessed.There was an improvement (median (IQ1-IQ3) in vaginal symptoms [TAH 6(2-8) vs 4(0-8), <i>p</i> < 0.001; NDVH 6(4-8.5) vs 5(0-8), p < 0.001; TLH 4(2-10.5) vs 4(0-10), p < 0.001], urinary flow symptoms [TAH 2(1-4) vs 1 (0-3), p < 0.001; NDVH 3 (2-5) vs 2 (0.5-4), p < 0.001; TLH 1(1-4) vs 1(0-3), <i>p</i> < 0.05], urinary voiding symptoms [TAH 0(0-0) vs 0(0-0), <i>p</i> = 0.20; NDVH 0(0-1) vs 0(0-0.8), <i>p</i> < 0.05; TLH 0(0-0) vs 0(0-0), p < 0.05] and urinary incontinence symptoms [TAH 0(0-2) vs 0(0-2), <i>p</i> = 0.06; NDVH 0(0-3) vs 0(0-3), <i>p</i> < 0.001; TLH 0(0-3) vs 0(0-2), <i>p</i> < 0.05] at 1-year (TAH <i>n</i> = 47, NDVH <i>n</i> = 45, TLH n = 47).

Prognostic Value of Severity Score Change for Septic Shock in the Emergency Room.,"The vital signs or laboratory test results of sepsis patients may change before clinical deterioration. This study examined the differences in prognostic performance when systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA), quick SOFA (qSOFA) scores, National Early Warning Score (NEWS), and lactate levels were repeatedly measured. Scores were obtained at arrival to triage, 1 h after fluid resuscitation, 1 h after vasopressor prescription, and before leaving the emergency room (ER) in 165 patients with septic shock. The relationships between score changes and in-hospital mortality, mechanical ventilation, admission to the intensive care unit, and mortality within seven days were compared using areas under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs). Scores measured before leaving the ER had the highest AUROCs across all variables (SIRS score 0.827 [0.737-0.917], qSOFA score 0.754 [0.627-0.838], NEWS 0.888 [0.826-0.950], SOFA score 0.835 [0.766-0.904], and lactate 0.872 [0.805-0.939]). When combined, SIRS + lactate (0.882 [0.804-0.960]), qSOFA + lactate (0.872 [0.808-0.935]), NEWS + lactate (0.909 [0.855-0.963]), and SOFA + lactate (0.885 [0.832-0.939]) showed improved AUROCs. In patients with septic shock, scoring systems show better predictive performances at the timepoints reflecting changes in vital signs and laboratory test results than at the time of arrival, and combining them with lactate values increases their predictive powers.","['lactate', 'outcome', 'prognosis', 'score', 'septic shock']"
Accuracy of Apple Watch fitness tracker for wheelchair use varies according to movement frequency and task.,"Individuals with disabilities have high prevalence of sedentary lifestyle, obesity, and cardiometabolic disease. Physical activity monitors (i.e., step counters) are ill-suited for tracking wheelchair pushes. The study purpose was to investigate the validity of a consumer-level fitness tracker (Apple Watch) designed for wheelchair users.Validation study. A total of 15 wheelchair users with disabilities and 15 able-bodied individuals completed 3-min bouts of wheelchair propulsion on a treadmill and arm ergometry at pre-determined cadences as well as overground obstacle and Figure 8 courses. Tracker stroke counts were compared against direct observation.We found no interaction of tracker counts and ability status across all tasks (P≥0.550), so results are presented for the combined sample. For treadmill tasks, Bland-Altman analysis (bias±limits of agreement) showed good agreement for only higher-rate fixed-frequency tasks (-15±48, -1±14, 0±5, and 0±27 for low, moderate, high, and variable cadence, respectively). Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) was 22%, 3%, 1%, and 6%, respectively. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) (95% confidence intervals) were -0.18 (-0.51-0.20), 0.47 (0.13-0.71), 0.98 (0.96-0.99), and 0.22 (-0.16-0.54). We found significant overestimation by the tracker at low frequency (P<0.01). Arm ergometry showed good agreement across all cadences (0±5, -1±3, 0±8, 6±6). MAPE was 1%, 1%, 1%, and 4%. ICCs were 0.88 (0.77-0.94), 0.95 (0.89-0.97), 0.88 (0.76-0.94), and 0.97 (0.87-0.97). We found minimal (2rpm) but significant differences at variable cadence (P<0.01). Overground tasks showed poor agreement for casual-pace and fast-pace obstacle course and Figure 8 task (-5±18, 0±23, and -18±32, respectively). MAPE was 15%, 18%, 21% and ICCs were 0.90 (0.79-0.95), 0.79 (0.59-0.90), and 0.82 (0.64-0.91). Significant differences were found for propulsion at casual pace (P<0.01) and the Figure 8 task (P<0.01).Apple Watch is suitable for tracking high-frequency standardized (i.e., treadmill) pushing and arm ergometry but not low-frequency pushing or overground tasks.","['Activity trackers', 'Disabled persons', 'Physical activity', 'Wheelchairs']"
High adherence to the Mediterranean diet and Alternative Healthy Eating Index are associated with reduced odds of metabolic syndrome and its components in participants of the ORISCAV-LUX2 study.,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a major risk factor for cardiometabolic complications. Certain dietary patterns play a pivotal role in improving MetS components. The aim of this investigation was to study associations between the Mediterranean Diet Score (MDS) and the Alternative Healthy Eating Index (AHEI) and the odds of MetS and its components in adults living in Luxembourg.Data from 1,404 adults participating in the cross-sectional ORISCAV-LUX2 study were analyzed by a self-reported questionnaire, anthropometric measures, a food frequency questionnaire (174 items), and blood/urine samples.A significant association of dietary indices and MetS was not found except when expressing MetS as a score (continuous variable, log-transformed), based on the weighting of compounds using exploratory factor analysis with the MDS (β = -0.118, 95% CI: -0.346, -0.120) and AHEI (β = -0.133, 95% CI: -0.059, -0.019). Fully adjusted linear regression models further showed significant inverse associations between components of MetS and MDS (all as log-transformed variables), including body mass index (BMI) (β = -0.0067, 95% CI: -0.0099, -0.0036), waist-circumference (WC) (β = -0.0048, 95% CI: -0.0072, -0.0024), systolic blood pressure (SBP) (β = -0.0038, 95% CI: -0.0061, -0.0016), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (β = -0.0035, 95% CI: -0.0060, -0.0009). Similarly, significant inverse associations between AHEI and components of MetS (log-transformed) included BMI (β = -0.0001, 95% CI: -0.0016, -0.0002), WC (β = -0.0007, 95% CI: -0.0011, -0.0002), SBP (β = -0.0006, 95% CI: -0.0010, -0.0002), and DBP (β = -0.0006, 95% CI: -0.0011, -0.0001).Higher adherence to a Mediterranean diet and following healthy eating guidelines were associated with reduced odds of MetS and several of its components in Luxembourgish residents, highlighting that balanced and healthy eating patterns are a crucial cornerstone in the fight against MetS.","['dietary indices', 'heart disease', 'hypertension', 'inflammation', 'oxidative stress', 'type 2 diabetes']"
The Association of Life Stress with Subsequent Brain and Cognitive Reserve in Middle-Aged Women.,"Cognitive and brain reserve refer to individual differences that allow some people to better withstand brain pathology than others. Although early life stress has been recognized as a risk factor for low reserve in late life, no research yet has studied this across midlife.To examine the associations of life stress with brain and cognitive reserve in midlife.We included 1,232 middle-aged women who participated in the ORACLE Study between 2002-2006). Life stress was calculated as the shared variance of four cumulative stress domains, created from items measured between pregnancy and 10 years after childbirth. Brain reserve was defined as healthy-appearing brain volume measured with MRI; cognitive reserve as better cognitive functioning than expected based on age, education, and brain MRI measures, using structural equation modelling.More life stress was associated with lower brain (standardized adjusted difference: -0.18 [95% CI 0.25,-0.12]) and cognitive reserve (-0.19 [-0.28,-0.10]). Although, effect sizes were typically smaller, cumulative stress domains were also associated with brain reserve (life events: -0.10 [-0.16,-0.04]; contextual stress: -0.13 [-0.19,-0.07]; parenting-related stress: -0.13[-0.19,-0.07]; interpersonal stress: -0.10 [-0.16,-0.04]) and cognitive reserve (life events: -0.18 [-0.25,-0.11]; contextual stress: -0.15 [-0.10,-0.02]; parenting-related stress: -0.10 [-0.18,-0.03]; interpersonal stress not significant).Women who experience more life stress in midlife were found to have lower reserve. Effects were primarily driven by shared variance across cumulative stress domains, suggesting that focusing on single domains may underestimate effects. The effect of life stress on lower reserve may make women with stress more prone to neurodegenerative disease later in life than women without stress.","['Cognitive reserve', 'epidemiology', 'middle aged', 'psychological', 'stress']"
Increased activity of lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> in non-severe asthma.,"Given increased risk of cardiovascular events in asthma we hypothesized that lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub>), an enzyme involved in atherosclerosis, is associated with proinflammatory and prothrombotic blood alterations in this disease.In 164 adult asthmatics (63 with severe asthma) we measured plasma Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> activity using the PLAC test. We determined its relations to inflammation and prothrombotic blood alterations.In asthma, Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> was inversely related to the age (β = -0.1 [-0.18 to -0.02]) and was lower in women (n = 122 [74%], 205 [182-242] vs. 243 [203-262] nmol/min/ml, p = 0.001). Interestingly, Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> correlated negatively with the asthma severity score (β = -0.15 [-0.23 to -0.07]), being 10.3% higher in those with non-severe (mild or moderate) asthma (n = 101, 62%) as compared to the severe disease subtype (224 [191-261] vs. 203 [181-229], p = 0.006 after adjustment for potential confounders). Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> activity was positively related to the levels of low-density lipoprotein (β = 0.1 [0.02-0.18]), triglycerides (β = 0.11 [0.03-0.19]) and glucose (β = 0.1 [0.02-0.18]) and inversely to the tumor necrosis factor α (β = -0.27 [-0.35 to -0.2]), high sensitivity C-reactive protein (β = -0.1 [-0.19 to -0.02]) and fibrinogen (β = -0.12 [-0.21 to -0.03]), as well as prothrombin (β = -0.16 [-0.24 to -0.08]), and parameters describing thrombin generation potential, such as endogenous thrombin potential (β = -0.14 [-0.21 to -0.06]) and peak thrombin generated (β = -0.2 [-0.28 to -0.12]).Elevated Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> activity in non-severe asthmatics suggests increased atherosclerotic risk in this group. Lower Lp-PLA<sub>2</sub> activity accompanied by its inverse relationship to inflammatory or prothrombotic blood biomarkers observed in turn in severe asthmatics might be related to the pathogenesis of more severe asthma phenotype.","['Asthma', 'Cardiovascular risk', 'Coagulation', 'Inflammation', 'Lipoproteinassociated phospholipase A2']"
Sporadic cerebral small vessel disease and cognitive decline in healthy older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis on prospective studies that provided risk estimates for the impact of 3 different MRI markers of small vessel disease (SVD), namely white matter hyperintensities (WMH), cerebral microbleeds (CMB) and lacunes, on cognitive decline in relatively healthy older adults without cognitive deficits at baseline. A total of 23 prospective studies comprising 11,486 participants were included for analysis. Extracted data was pooled, reviewed and meta-analysed separately for global cognition, executive function, memory and attention. The pooled effect size for the association between cerebral SVD and cognitive decline was for global cognition -0.10 [-0.14; -0.05], for executive functioning -0.18 [-0.24; - 0.11], for memory -0.12 [-0.17; -0.07], and for attention -0.17 [-0.23; -0.11]. Results for the association of individual MRI markers of cerebral SVD were statistically significant for WMH and global cognition -0.15 [-0.24; -0.06], WMH and executive function -0.23 [-0.33; -0.13], WMH and memory -0.19 [-0.29; -0.09], WMH and attention -0.24 [-0.39; -0.08], CMB and executive function -0.07 [-0.13; -0.02], CMB and memory -0.11 [-0.21; -0.02] and CMB and attention -0.13 [-0.25; -0.02]. In conclusion, presence of MRI markers of cerebral SVD were found to predict an increased risk of cognitive decline in relatively healthy older adults. While WMH were found to significantly affect all cognitive domains, CMB influenced decline in executive functioning over time as well as (in some studies) decline in memory and attention.","['Cognitive decline', 'MRI', 'cerebral small vessel disease', 'metaanalysis', 'older adults']"
Perceptions of Safety and Stress Among Health Professionals: The Role of Care Unit Identification as a Protective Factor During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"The present study aimed to investigate the role of motivational process and coping resources in health professionals during the COVID-19 emergency examining the role of Care Unit Identification and safety climate perception as resources that can help nurses to cope with stressors. A cross-sectional research design was used and 218 nurses completed a self-report questionnaire measuring: Perception of safety, Care Unit identification, Work Engagement, Psychological Distress, and Burnout. Results revealed that Work Engagement was significantly related with Burnout (<i>b</i> = -0.209, 95%CI [-0.309; -0.109]) and Distress (<i>b</i> = -0.355, 95%CI [-0.529; -0.18]) especially when the Care Unit identification is high (<i>b</i> = -0.303, 95%CI [-0.448; -0.157] and <i>b</i> = -0.523, 95%CI [-0.772; -0.275], respectively). The safety perception was positively related to Work Engagement (<i>b</i> = 0.315, 95%CI [0.198; 0.433]) and had an indirect effect on psychological Distress (<i>b</i> = -0.112, 95%CI [-0.181; -0.042]) and Burnout (<i>b</i> = -0.066, 95%CI [-0.105; -0.027]). High levels of both Care Unit identification and perception of safety, along with personal work engagement, appear to protect nurses from burnout and psychological distress. Findings suggest that the effort to improve teamwork identification and ensures an adequate degree of perceived safety for healthcare professionals need to be maintained and reinforced as they positively impact nurses' wellbeing.","['burnout', 'distress', 'health professionals', 'perception of safety climate', 'teamwork identification', 'work engagement']"
Macular pigment optical density and its determinants in a Russian population: the ural eye and medical study.,"To assess the macular pigment optical density (MPOD) and its associations with ocular and systemic parameters and diseases.The population-based study Ural Eye and Medical Study included 5899 (80.5%) out of 7328 eligible individuals. As part of ophthalmological and systemic examinations, MPOD was measured by reflectometry.Macular pigment optical density (MPOD) data were available for 4889 (82.9%) individuals (mean age:57.8 ± 10.1 years;range: 40-94). Mean values for MOPD, maximal MOPD, macular pigment (MP) area and MP volume were 0.13 ± 0.04 d.u. (density units), 0.36 ± 0.09 d.u., 60 791 ± 14 826 pixel and 8033 ± 2888 d.u.pixel, respectively. A higher MP density was correlated (regression coefficient r: 0.63) with older age (standardized regression coefficient beta: 0.59; non-standardized regression coefficient B: 0.23; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.22, 0.23; p < 0.001), female sex (beta: 0.08; B:0.63; 95%CI: 0.44, 0.83; p < 0.001), rural region of habitation (beta: 0.13; B: 1.02; 95%CI: 0.83, 1.22; p < 0.001), lower body mass index (beta: -0.04; B: -0.03; 95%CI: -0.05, 0.01; p = 0.004), lower prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (beta: -0.03; B: -0.43; 95%CI: -0.79, -0.08; p = 0.02), higher erythrocyte sedimentation rate (beta: 0.03; B: 0.01; 95%CI: 0.002, 0.02; p = 0.03), lower leukocyte cell count (beta: -0.04; B: -0.10; 95%CI: -0.16, -0.03; p = 0.003), thinner temporal parafoveal retinal thickness (beta: -0.06; B: -0.01;95%CI: -0.01, -0.003; p < 0.001), thinner central corneal thickness (beta: -0.06; B: -0.006; 95%CI: -0.009, -0.004; p < 0.001), higher prevalence of pseudophakia (beta: 0.09;B:2.08; 95%CI: 1.50, 2.65; p < 0.001) and reticular pseudo drusen (RPD) (beta: 0.03; B: 0.56; 95%CI: 0.13, 0.98; p = 0.01) and lower stage of open-angle glaucoma (beta: -0.03; B: -0.39; 95%CI: -0.74, -0.04; p = 0. 03). Prevalence (p = 0.44; beta: -0.01) and degree (p = 0.70; beta: -0.01) of angle-closure glaucoma, prevalence (p = 0.31; beta: 0.01) of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) without RPD and prevalence (p = 0.95; beta: 0.001) of diabetic retinopathy were not significantly associated with the mean MP density in that model.A higher RPD prevalence and lower stage of open-angle glaucoma were ophthalmological disorders associated with a higher MPOD in a multivariable analysis, including parameters of older age, pseudophakia, female sex, rural region, lower body mass index and lower perifoveal retinal thickness.","['Ufa eye and medical study', 'macula', 'macular pigment', 'zeaxanthin', 'mesozeaxanthin']"
Determinants of health-related quality of life in spondyloarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis - data from the COMOSPA and COMORA studies.,"To assess the hierarchy of outcomes contributing to health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in spondyloarthritis (SpA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Data from the international cross-sectional COMOSPA and COMORA studies were used. HRQoL was assessed using the EuroQOL 5-dimension 3-level (EQ-5D-3 L). First, multivariable linear regression models were used to identify associations between EQ-5D-3 L (dependent variable) and several demographic and clinical variables (independent variables). Second, a decision tree was built using Chi-square Automatic Interaction Detector, a method of unbiased hierarchical multivariable analysis (dependent variable: EQ-5D-3 L).In total, 3984 patients with SpA and 3920 patients with RA were included. In SpA, HRQoL was associated with BASFI (adjusted B=-0.006; 95%CI=-0.007 to -0.005), ASDAS (-0.052; -0.071 to -0.033), work productivity loss score (-0.002; -0.003 to -0.002), NSAID treatment (-0.052; -0.083 to -0.020), bDMARD treatment (-0.051; -0.082 to -0.021), university education (-0.051; -0.075 to -0.027) and radiographic sacroiliitis (0.035; 0.004 to 0.030). In RA, HRQoL was associated with modified Health Assessment Questionnaire (MHAQ) (-0.220, -0.253 to -0.188), DAS28-CRP-3v (-0.027, -0.036 to -0.018), work productivity loss score (-0.003, -0.003 to -0.002), presence of erosions (-0.042, -0.065 to -0.020), alcohol consumption ≥3 units/day (0.012, 0.001 to 0.024)) and csDMARD treatment (0.034, 0.001 to 0.066). The decision tree revealed BASFI and MHAQ as first variables with the most discriminative power on EQ-5D-3 L, followed by work productivity loss and disease activity, in both SpA and RA cohorts.In SpA and RA, physical function is the main contributor to HRQoL measured by EQ-5D-3 L, followed by disease activity and work productivity loss.","['Disease activity', 'Healthrelated quality of life', 'Physical function', 'Rheumatoid arthritis', 'Spondyloarthritis']"
Association of dietary intake of saturated fatty acids with hypertension: 1999-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.,"This study aimed to assess the relationship between the dietary intake of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and its subtypes (C4:0, C6:0, C8:0, C10:0, C12:0, C14:0, C16:0, and C18:0) and hypertension.Adults aged 20 years and older based used the U.S. Health and Nutrition Survey (1999-2018) were used as participants. Two averages of 24 h dietary recall data were obtained for weight-adjusted continuous cross-sectional analysis. Two 24-h recall interview data means were obtained for weight-adjusted continuous cross-sectional analysis. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the weighted odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) for hypertension.The study included 7,222 respondents over 20 years of age with a hypertension prevalence of 23.2% and a significant difference in the dietary intake of carbohydrates among patients with hypertension. Dietary intake of nutrients was more in men than in women with hypertension. After adjusting for confounders, adjusting for nutrients, and reducing covariance among nutrients, the OR (95% CI) for women's dietary intake of SFAs, C14:0, C16:0, C18:0 fourth quartile, and C14:0 third quartile were 0.57 (0.34, 0.95), 0.57 (0.34, 0.95), 0.57 (0.34, 0.95), 0.57 (0.34, 0.95), and 0.57 (0.34, 0.95), respectively, which may be a risk factor for hypertension. In older (≥65, years) respondents, the OR (95% CI) for dietary intake of SFAs, C4:0, C14:0, C16:0 fourth quartile, and C12:0 third quartile were 0.42 (0.21, 0.86), 0.46 (0.22, 0.95), 0.39 (0.18, 0.85), 0.38 (0.17, 0.84), and 0.45 (0.20, 0.99), respectively, which may be a protective factor for hypertension.The study was based on the American Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and a strong correlation was found between dietary intake of SFAs, C14:0, C16:0, and C18:0 and hypertension in women (dietary intake of SFAs, C4:0, C12:0, C14:0, and C16:0) and middle-aged and older adults (dietary intake of SFAs, C4:0, C12:0, C14:0, and C16:0). In addition, dietary nutrient intake should be carefully selected for the rational prevention of hypertension.","['NHANES', 'cardiovascular disease', 'dietary saturated fatty acids', 'doseresponse', 'subtype']"
"Diagnostic accuracy of FeNO in asthma and predictive value for inhaled corticosteroid responsiveness: A prospective, multicentre study.","Fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) is promising for diagnosing asthma and could replace bronchial provocation (BP). To date, cut-off values have been derived by post hoc analysis only. The aim was to validate the diagnostic accuracy for predefined FeNO cut-off values and the predictive value for responsiveness to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS).We conducted a prospective, diagnostic, multicentre study with patients attending three private practices of pneumologists in Upper Bavaria, Germany, from July 3, 2020 to Jan 21, 2022. Index test was FENO measurement. Reference standard was Tiffeneau ratio (FEV<sub>1</sub>/VC) or airway resistance as assessed by whole body plethysmography, with additional BP or bronchodilation test. Follow-up was performed after 12 weeks. Analyses of Receiver Operating Characteristics curves were conducted to determine the diagnostic accuracy and predictive value of FeNO.308 patients with complete follow-up were recruited, 186 (60·4%) were female, average age was 44·7 years, 161 (52·3%) had asthma. Regarding diagnostic accuracy, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0·718 (95% CI 0·661-0·775; <i>p</i> < 0·001). Sensitivity at FeNO >50 ppb was 0·24 (95% CI 0·18-0·32), specificity 0·99 (0·95-1·0), positive predictive value (PPV) 0·95 (0·84-0·99), negative predictive value (NPV) 0·54 (0·48-0·60). In 66 patients with ´wheezing´ and ´allergic rhinitis´, the sensitivity at FeNO >33 ppb was 0·49 (0·34-0·64), specificity 0·88 (0·64-0·99), PPV 0·92 (0·75-0·99), NPV 0·38 (0·23-0·54). In 68 patients with ICS medication, responsiveness was predicted at the cut-off >43 ppb, with a sensitivity of 0·55 (95%CI 0·36-0·74), specificity 0·82 (0·66-0·92), PPV 0·70 (0·47-0·87), NPV 0·71 (0·56-0·84).FeNO measurement allows a valid ruling-in of an asthma diagnosis, whereas ruling-out of asthma is not possible. Enhanced probability of ICS responsiveness is also given with increased FeNO values.Circassia Germany gave 25% discount on the purchase of three NIOX VERO devices.","['Asthma', 'Corticosteroid responsiveness', 'Diagnostic study', 'Fractional exhaled nitric oxide', 'Sensitivity', 'Specificity']"
Longitudinal associations between self-reported sleep duration and cardiometabolic disease risk in corporate executives.,"This study aimed to determine the longitudinal associations between self-reported sleep duration and cardiometabolic disease (CMD) risk in corporate executives.Self-reported sleep duration and lifestyle, occupational, psychological, and anthropometrical, blood pressure and blood marker variables were obtained from 1512 employees at annual health risk assessments in South Africa between 2016 and 2019. Gender-stratified linear mixed models, adjusting for age, lifestyle, occupational and psychological covariates were used to explore these longitudinal associations.Among women, shorter sleep duration was associated with higher body mass index (BMI) covarying for age only (ß with 95% confidence intervals: -0.19 [-0.36, -0.03]), age and occupational factors (-0.20 [-0.36, -0.03]) and age and psychological factors (-0.20 [-0.37, -0.03]). Among men, shorter sleep was associated with both BMI and waist circumference (WC) covarying for age only (BMI: -0.15 [-0.22; -0.08]; WC: -0.62 [-0.88; -0.37]); age and lifestyle factors (BMI: -0.12 [-0.21; -0.04]); WC: -0.016 [-0.92; -0.29], age and occupational factors (BMI: -0.20 [-0.22; 0.08]; WC: -0.62 [-0.88; -0.36]), and age and psychological factors (BMI: -0.15 [-0.22; -0.07]; WC: -0.59 [-0.86; -0.33]). Among men, shorter sleep was also longitudinally associated with higher CMD risk scores in models adjusted for age and lifestyle factors (CMD: -0.12 [-0.20; -0.04]) and age and psychological factors (CMD: -0.08 [-0.15; -0.01]).Corporate executives who report shorter sleep durations may present with poorer CMD risk profiles, independent of age, lifestyle, occupational and psychological factors. Addressing sleep health in workplace health programmes may help mitigate the development of CMD in such employees.","['Employees', 'Health promotion', 'Health risk assessment', 'Longitudinal study', 'Sleep quantity', 'Workplace']"
Efficacy of flavonoids-containing supplements on insulin resistance and associated metabolic risk factors in overweight and obese subjects: a systematic review and meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials.,"Obesity is becoming a global epidemic. Flavonoids, with anti-inflammatory and antioxidative functions, are proposed to treat insulin resistance (IR) in obese subjects. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of flavonoids-containing supplements on IR and associated metabolic risk factors in overweight and obese participants.Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving flavonoids-containing supplements used to treat overweight and obese subjects with results of IR, other associated metabolic risk factors, and adverse effects published were retrieved from 5 electronic databases from the year of inception to January 2, 2022.Twenty-five RCTs (n = 1950) were included. Pooled results demonstrated that HOMA-IR in the group receiving flavonoids-containing supplements significantly decreased versus the control group (WMD = -0.132, 95% CI: -0.236 to -0.027, <i>p</i> = 0.013). Subgroup analyses showed that HOMA-IR in the subgroup receiving flavonoid-containing mixtures significantly decreased (WMD = -0.25, 95% CI: -0.43 to -0.06, <i>p</i> = 0.008), whereas such result was not found in the singly-used flavonoids subgroup (WMD = -0.08, 95% CI: -0.20 to 0.05, <i>p</i> = 0.240). In addition, QUICKI in the experimental group had an increasing trend compared to that in the control group (WMD = 0.01, 95% CI: -0.00 to 0.02, <i>p</i> = 0.065). For secondary outcomes, FBG, FBI, TC, TG, SBP, weight, BMI, and WHR in the group receiving flavonoids-containing supplements dropped significantly compared to those in the controls (WMD = -0.05, 95% CI: -0.08 to -0.02, <i>p</i> = 0.002; WMD = -0.58, 95% CI: -1.04 to -0.12, <i>p</i> = 0.014; WMD = -0.04, 95% CI: -0.06 to -0.03, <i>p</i> < 0.001; WMD = -0.04, 95% CI: -0.05 to -0.03, <i>p</i> < 0.001; WMD = -2.01, 95% CI: -3.17 to -0.86, <i>p</i> = 0.001; WMD = -0.29, 95% CI: -0.49 to -0.09, <i>p</i> = 0.004; WMD = -0.10 95% CI: -0.17 to -0.04, <i>p</i> = 0.003; WMD = -0.10, 95% CI: -0.01 to -0.00, <i>p</i> = 0.015; respectively). Adverse reactions did not differ between the group receiving flavonoids-containing supplements and the control group (RR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.62 to 1.52, <i>p</i> = 0.905).This study showed that flavonoids-containing supplements may be efficacious and safe in improving IR and associated metabolic risk factors in overweight and obese participants. Nevertheless, doubt over the findings remains because limited RCTs per type of flavonoids-containing supplement were investigated, and many of the RCTs had a small sample size. Therefore, the findings must be validated in future research.https://inplasy.com/inplasy-2022-2-0011/, identifier INPLASY202220011.","['Flavonoids', 'insulin resistance', 'metaanalysis', 'obesity', 'overweight', 'systematic review']"
Hand grip strength is associated with cardiopulmonary function in Chinese adults: Results from a cross-sectional study.,"The objective of this population-based study was to examine whether there was association of hand grip strength (HGS) with cardiopulmonary function in population without cardiopulmonary disease.Data were derived from an ongoing cross-sectional survey of the National Physique and Health in Shanxi Province. There were 908 participants with the cardiac function tests and 380 participants with the pulmonary function tests. Multiple linear regression analysis was used to assess the association of HGS with cardiopulmonary function.Among participants with the cardiac function tests, HGS was positively associated with left ventricular end diastolic diameter in both genders (male: <i>b</i> = 0.010 (0.005, 0.015), <i>P</i> < 0.001; female: <i>b</i> = 0.008 (0.002, 0.014), <i>P</i> = 0.01) and left ventricular ejection fraction in males (<i>b</i> = 0.114 (0.027, 0.201), <i>P</i> = 0.01). Among participants with the pulmonary function tests, HGS was positively associated with vital capacity (male: <i>b</i> = 0.033 (0.021, 0.045); female: <i>b</i> = 0.033 (0.021, 0.045)), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (male: <i>b</i> = 0.023 (0.014, 0.032); female: <i>b</i> = 0.019 (0.010, 0.028)) and maximal voluntary ventilation (male: <i>b</i> = 1.186 (0.665, 1.708); female: <i>b</i> = 0.965 (0.453, 1.476)) in both genders (all <i>P</i> < 0.001).These results suggested that greater HGS was associated with favorable cardiopulmonary function in Chinese adults, thus HGS might be an indicator of cardiopulmonary function.","['COPD', 'Cardiac function', 'Hand grip strength', 'Muscle strength', 'Pulmonary function']"
Glucocorticoids associate with cardiometabolic risk factors in black South Africans.,"Circulating glucocorticoids are associated with metabolic syndrome and related cardiometabolic risk factors in non-Africans. This study investigated these associations in Africans, whose metabolic phenotype reportedly differs from Europeans. Adiposity, blood pressure, glycaemia, insulin resistance, and lipid profile, were measured in 316 African men and 788 African women living in Soweto, Johannesburg. The 2009 harmonized criteria were used to define metabolic syndrome. Serum glucocorticoids were measured using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Cortisol was associated with greater odds presenting with metabolic syndrome (odds ratio (95% CI) =1.50 (1.04, 2.17) and higher systolic (beta coefficient, β (95% CI) =0.04 (0.01, 0.08)) and diastolic (0.05 (0.02, 0.09)) blood pressure, but higher HDL (0.10 (0.02, 0.19)) and lower LDL (-0.14 (-0.24, -0.03)) cholesterol concentrations, in the combined sample of men and women. In contrast, corticosterone was only associated with higher insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index; 0.22 (0.03, 0.41)), but this was not independent of BMI. Sex-specific associations were observed, such that both cortisol and corticosterone were associated with higher fasting glucose (standardized β (95% CI): 0.24 (0.12, 0.36) for cortisol and 0.12 (0.01, 0.23) for corticosterone) and HbA1c (0.13 (0.01, 0.25) for cortisol and 0.12 (0.01, 0.24) for corticosterone) in men only, but lower HbA1c (0.10 (-0.20, -0.01) for cortisol and -0.09 (-0.18, -0.03) for corticosterone) in women only. Our study reports for the first time that associations between circulating glucocorticoid concentrations and key cardiometabolic risk factors exhibit both glucocorticoid- and sex-specificity in Africans.","['cardiometabolic risk factors', 'corticosterone', 'cortisol', 'glucocorticoids', 'metabolic syndrome']"
Diagnostic value of two dimensional shear wave elastography combined with texture analysis in early liver fibrosis.,"Staging diagnosis of liver fibrosis is a prerequisite for timely diagnosis and therapy in patients with chronic hepatitis B. In recent years, ultrasound elastography has become an important method for clinical noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis stage, but its diagnostic value for early liver fibrosis still needs to be further improved. In this study, the texture analysis was carried out on the basis of two dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE), and the feasibility of 2D-SWE plus texture analysis in the diagnosis of early liver fibrosis was discussed.To assess the diagnostic value of 2D-SWE combined with textural analysis in liver fibrosis staging.This study recruited 46 patients with chronic hepatitis B. Patients underwent 2D-SWE and texture analysis; Young's modulus values and textural patterns were obtained, respectively. Textural pattern was analyzed with regard to contrast, correlation, angular second moment (ASM), and homogeneity. Pathological results of biopsy specimens were the gold standard; comparison and assessment of the diagnosis efficiency were conducted for 2D-SWE, texture analysis and their combination.2D-SWE displayed diagnosis efficiency in early fibrosis, significant fibrosis, severe fibrosis, and early cirrhosis (AUC > 0.7, <i>P</i> < 0.05) with respective AUC values of 0.823 (0.678-0.921), 0.808 (0.662-0.911), 0.920 (0.798-0.980), and 0.855 (0.716-0.943). Contrast and homogeneity displayed independent diagnosis efficiency in liver fibrosis stage (AUC > 0.7, <i>P</i> < 0.05), whereas correlation and ASM showed limited values. AUC of contrast and homogeneity were respectively 0.906 (0.779-0.973), 0.835 (0.693-0.930), 0.807 (0.660-0.910) and 0.925 (0.805-0.983), 0.789 (0.639-0.897), 0.736 (0.582-0.858), 0.705 (0.549-0.883) and 0.798 (0.650-0.904) in four liver fibrosis stages, which exhibited equivalence to 2D-SWE in diagnostic efficiency (<i>P</i> > 0.05). Combined diagnosis (PRE) displayed diagnostic efficiency (AUC > 0.7, <i>P</i> < 0.01) for all fibrosis stages with respective AUC of 0.952 (0.841-0.994), 0.896 (0.766-0.967), 0.978 (0.881-0.999), 0.947 (0.835-0.992). The combined diagnosis showed higher diagnosis efficiency over 2D-SWE in early liver fibrosis (<i>P</i> < 0.05), whereas no significant differences were observed in other comparisons (<i>P</i> > 0.05).Texture analysis was capable of diagnosing liver fibrosis stage, combined diagnosis had obvious advantages in early liver fibrosis, liver fibrosis stage might be related to the hepatic tissue hardness distribution.","['Elastography', 'Liver fibrosis', 'Staging', 'Texture analysis', 'Twodimensional shear wave']"
Correlation between apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and cellularity is different in several tumors: a meta-analysis.,"The purpose of this meta-analysis was to provide clinical evidence regarding relationship between ADC and cellularity in different tumors based on large patient data. Medline library was screened for associations between ADC and cell count in different tumors up to September 2016. Only publications in English were extracted. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA) was used for the research. Overall, 39 publications with 1530 patients were included into the analysis. The following data were extracted from the literature: authors, year of publication, number of patients, tumor type, and correlation coefficients. The pooled correlation coefficient for all studies was ρ = -0.56 (95 % CI = [-0.62; -0.50]),. Correlation coefficients ranged from <i>ρ</i> =-0.25 (95 % CI = [-0.63; 0.12]) in lymphoma to ρ=-0.66 (95 % CI = [-0.85; -0.47]) in glioma.

Can smartphone use affect chronic disease self-management among Chinese middle-aged and older adults? A moderated mediation model.,"Chronic disease self-management is influenced by many factors. Previous studies have linked patients' media use with chronic disease self-management, but the underlying mechanisms of this relationship are less understood.The purpose of this study is to explore the mediating role of family health (FH) between frequency of smartphone use (FOSU) and self-management behaviors among middle-aged and older patients with chronic diseases (SBAMAOPWCD) through a moderated mediation model, and whether this indirect relationship is modified by the solitary status of middle-aged and older Chinese patients with chronic disease.Surveys were collected from 1,424 (<i>N</i> = 1,424; age > 45) middle-aged and older with one or more chronic conditions in China on self-reports of FOSU, FH and Chronic disease self-management behaviors were used to examine the moderated mediation model.The results showed that the FOSU was significantly and positively associated with SBAMAOPWCD (<i>β</i> = 0.220, <i>p</i> < 0.001; <i>β</i> = 0.170, <i>p</i> < 0.001; <i>β</i> = 0.167, <i>p</i> < 0.001; <i>β</i> = 0.158, <i>p</i> < 0.001); The Family health resources (FHR) dimension of FH and the Family external social supports (FESS) dimension mediated the relationship between the FOSU and SBAMAOPWCD (<i>β</i> = -0.0758, CI: -0.1402, -0.0236; <i>β</i> = 0.0721, CI: 0.0141, 0.1458), Among them, the FHR dimension mediated mainly among FOSU, exercise and cognitive symptom management practices (CSMP; <i>β</i> = -0.0344, CI: -0.0652, -0.0102; <i>β</i> = -0.0401, CI: -0.0725, -0.0138), the FESS dimension of the FH mediated the relationship between the FOSU and communication with physicians (CWP; <i>β</i> = 0.0376, CI: 0.0116, 0.0705); Solitary state played a moderating role in the relationship between FHR dimension and SBAMAOPWCD (live alone <i>β</i> = -0.2395, CI: -0.4574, -0.0661; not live-alone <i>β</i> = -0.0599, CI: -0.1164, -0.0172). In addition, solitary state played a moderating role in the relationship among FHR dimension and CSMP for middle-aged and older patients (live alone <i>β</i> = -0.1095, CI: -0.1961, -0.0378; not live-alone <i>β</i> = -0.0334, CI: -0.0633, -0.0102). Interestingly, the relationship between FESS dimension and SBAMAOPWCD was moderated only by the non-live alone population (<i>β</i> = 0.0676, CI: 0.0008, 0.1478), and not by the live-alone population (<i>β</i> = 0.1026, CI: -0.1061, 0.3278).Unexpectedly, we found that when their FHR were lower, they reported higher levels of chronic disease self-management, middle-aged and older patients with chronic diseases who live alone are more significant in this impact relationship.The study further deepens our understanding of the mechanisms linking frequency of smartphone use with chronic disease self-management behaviors, and it helps to develop interventions to improve chronic disease self-management behaviors in middle-aged and older adults.","['chronic disease selfmanagement', 'family health', 'frequency of smartphone use', 'middleaged and elder people', 'moderated mediation model']"
Perfluoroalkyl substances and beta cell deficient diabetes.,"Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are synthetic hydrocarbons shown to preserve pancreatic islet cell viability and reduce islet cell hypoxia and apoptosis. We investigated the relationship of serum PFAS with diabetes, and whether this varied by diabetes type.6,460 individuals with and 60,439 without diabetes from the C8 Health Project, were categorized into three groups: type 1 (n=820), type 2 (n=4,291), or uncategorized diabetes (n=1,349, missing data on diabetes type or diabetes based on blood sugar at study entry). Four PFAS were investigated: perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorononaoic acid (PFNA).PFAS levels were significantly lower in those with diabetes, and lowest in those with type 1 diabetes. In age and sex adjusted analyses, ORs (CI) for type 1, type 2, and uncategorized diabetes compared to no diabetes were 0.59 (0.54-0.64), 0.74 (0.71-0.77), 0.84 (0.78-0.90), respectively for PFHxS; 0.69 (0.65-0.74), 0.87 (0.89-0.91), 0.92 (0.88-0.97), respectively for PFOA; 0.65 (0.61-0.70), 0.86 (0.82-0.90), 0.93 (0.86-1.03), respectively for PFOS; and 0.65 (0.57-0.74), 0.94 (0.88-1.00), 0.95 (0.85-1.06), respectively for PFNA. Further adjustment for eGFR and other covariates did not eliminate these inverse associations.PFAS levels were negatively associated with diabetes. This inverse relationship was strongest for type 1 diabetes, suggesting the relationship with serum PFAS may vary with the severity of islet cell deficiency.","['Beta cell', 'Environmental contaminants', 'Islet cell', 'Perfluoroalkyl substances', 'Perfluorocarbons', 'Type 1 diabetes']"
A cross-sectional evaluation of communication skills and perceived barriers among the resident doctors at a tertiary care center in India.,"The study was conducted to assess the different components of communication skills and barriers to practicing good communication skills among resident doctors in a health care setting.A web-based cross-sectional survey was performed, and data were collected using a pre-validated questionnaire with a Cronbach's alpha (0.88). A total of 431 responses were statistically analyzed. Chi-square test was used to associate the socio-demographics and communication skills. Regression analysis was conducted to analyze the association between various communication domains and barriers, which were adjusted for potential confounders such as age and gender.Resident doctors have differential levels of competencies in each domain of communication skills. Around two-thirds of the residents did not practice good communication skills while breaking the bad news and reported poor para-verbal skills. Some of the most common barriers to practicing good communication skills were found to be an infrastructural deficit, lack of time, and long working hours. These barriers significantly affected the communication skills such as para-verbal skills {[-0.32; <i>P</i> < 0.01; C.I (-0.54 to -0.09), [-0.27, <i>P</i> < 0.05, C.I (-0.54 to. 004)], [-0.32, <i>P</i> < 0.01, (0.07-0.56)]}, the ability to break bad news {[-0.42, <i>P</i> < 0.01, (-0.73 to -0.11)], [-0.35, <i>P</i> < 0.05, (-0.75 to -0.35)], [0.48, <i>P</i> < 0.01, (0.12-0.84)]}, and communication with patients/attendants {[0.39, <i>P</i> < 0.01, C.I (-0.71 to -0.06)], [-0.88, <i>P</i> < 0.001, C.I (-1.2 to -0.48)], [-0.88, <i>P</i> < 0.001, C.I (-1.2 to -0.48)]} after adjustment for confounding such as age and gender.There is a scope for improvement in practicing good communication skills with patients, among the residents doctors in India. Structured modules for training and evaluation should be implemented in the medical curriculum.","['Communication', 'communication barriers', 'health personnel', 'workplace violence']"
"Correlation Between Corneal Topographic, Densitometry, and Biomechanical Parameters in Keratoconus Eyes.","To investigate the correlation between corneal densitometry, corneal topographic parameters, and corneal biomechanical properties in keratoconus.A total of 76 eyes of 76 keratoconus patients were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. Corneal densitometry and topography were measured using Pentacam HR. Corneal biomechanical properties were measured using CorVis ST.The corneal densitometry values of the anterior 0 to 2 and 2 to 6 mm layers significantly correlated with the maximum keratometry values (<i>R</i> = 0.373, <i>P</i> = 0.001 and <i>R</i> = 0.276, <i>P</i> = 0.016, respectively), thinnest corneal thickness values (<i>R</i> = -0.331, <i>P</i> = 0.003 and <i>R</i> = -0.234, <i>P</i> = 0.042, respectively), anterior corneal elevation (<i>R</i> = 0.392, <i>P</i> < 0.001 and <i>R</i> = 0.323, <i>P</i> = 0.004, respectively), and posterior corneal elevation (<i>R</i> = 0.450, <i>P</i> < 0.001 and <i>R</i> = 0.367, <i>P</i> = 0.001, respectively). The stiffness parameter-applanation time 1 (SP-A1) significantly correlated with the corneal densitometry values for the anterior 0 to 2 mm (<i>R</i> = -0.397, <i>P</i> < 0.001), anterior 2 to 6 mm (<i>R</i> = -0.331, <i>P</i> = 0.004), central 0 to 2 mm (<i>R</i> = -0.306, <i>P</i> = 0.007), central 2 to 6 mm (<i>R</i> = -0.228, <i>P</i> = 0.048), posterior 2 to 6 mm (<i>R</i> = -0.243, <i>P</i> = 0.035), total 0 to 2 mm (<i>R</i> = -0.291, <i>P</i> = 0.011), and total 2 to 6 mm (<i>R</i> = -0.295, <i>P</i> = 0.010) layers.The corneal densitometry values correlated with the severity of keratoconus and the SP-A1 values.Corneal densitometry values may serve as markers to predict the severity of keratoconus.","['CorVis ST', 'Pentacam HR', 'biomechanics', 'corneal structure', 'keratoconus']"
FENOMA Study: Achieving Full Control in Patients with Severe Allergic Asthma.,"A Spanish real-world study in patients with severe persistent asthma who achieved asthma control after a one-year treatment with omalizumab highlighted the phenotypic heterogeneity of these patients (FENOMA study). In this subanalysis, we describe the clinical improvement in patients with severe allergic asthma in this study (positive skin test and IgE level 30-1500 IU/mL); n=240.FENOMA was an observational, multicentre, retrospective study in 345 patients achieving asthma control according to Spanish guidelines (GEMA). Baseline demographic and asthma-related characteristics were collected. Outcomes analyzed were those included in asthma control definition plus changes in background treatments and in blood eosinophil count (%) and exhaled nitric oxide fraction [FeNO].At baseline, patients were aged 45.4±15.0 years; 67% were women. Median (Q1;Q3) IgE levels were 302.5 (154.0; 553.5) IU/mL. After one-year treatment with omalizumab: 43.3% of patients had daytime symptoms vs 97.7% before treatment and 49.6% stopped taking oral corticosteroids. FEV<sub>1</sub> increased a median of 12.0 (4.0; 23.0)%; P <0.0001. The number of non-severe asthma exacerbations decreased a median of -4.0 (-7.0; 2.0); P <0.0001. Median unplanned visits to primary care or specialists and days of school/workplace absenteeism decreased from 4.9 (2.0; 6.0), 1.0 (0.0; 3.0) and 0.0 (0.0; 14.0) to 0.0 (0.0; 1.0), 0.0 (0.0; 0.0) and 0.0 (0.0; 0.0), respectively. Median eosinophil blood count and FeNO decreased from 5.0 (3:0; 8.0)% to 3.0 (2.0; 5.5)% and from 36.0 (23:0; 53.0) ppb to 20.0 (13.0; 34.0) ppb, respectively.This study highlights the asthma control achieved by patients with severe allergic asthma treated with omalizumab, with relevant benefits on the burden of the disease both on patients and the healthcare system.","['IgE', 'allergy', 'asthma', 'exacerbations', 'omalizumab']"
Efficacy of a Modified Audio-Tactile Performance Technique with Braille (ATPb) on the Oral Hygiene Status of Visually-Impaired Children.,"We assessed the effectiveness of a modified audio-tactile performance (ATP) technique with braille (ATPb) on the oral health statuses of visually-impaired children.Ninety visually-impaired institutionalized children received oral hygiene instructions using audio (AM), ATP or ATPb techniques. Plaque scores were assessed at baseline and after reinforcement and non-reinforcement periods.In the totally visually-impaired, mean reductions in plaque scores in the ATPb, ATP and AM groups during the reinforcement period were 1.119 ± 0.260, 0.654 ± 0.239 and 0.237 ± 0.255, respectively (p <0.001), worsening to 0.107 ± 0.160, 0.083 ± 0.193 and -0.208 ± 0.267 during the non-reinforcement period (p <0.001), before culminating at 6 months at 1.227 ± 0.261, 0.737 ± 0.317 and 0.029 ± 0.108 (p <0.001). In partially visually-impaired children, reductions during the reinforcement period were 0.934 ± 0.279, 0.762 ± 0.270 and 0.118 ± 0.237, respectively, dropping to 0.176 ± 0.166, 0.083 ± 0.169 and -0.128 ± 0.114 without reinforcement and culminating at 1.109 ± 0.258, 0.845 ± 0.292 and -0.010 ± 0.226 (p <0.001). There were significant inter-group differences during the three periods (p <0.001), except in the ATP and ATPb groups during the non-reinforcement period for totally impaired (p = 0.157) and during reinforcement (p = 0.155) and non-reinforcement (p = 0.051) periods for partially impaired children.All three techniques were successful when reinforced periodically. However, only ATP and ATPb were successful during periods without reinforcement. The modified audio-tactile performance technique with braille (ATPb) was most effective, allowing visually-impaired children to retain oral hygiene information without intervention.","['Audiotactile technique', 'Braille', 'Oral health education', 'Visually impaired children']"
Comparison of Time to Report the Side Effects after AstraZeneca and Sinopharm Vaccinations in Users of the COVID-19 Symptom Study App: A Survey in South Iran.,"Concerns about the side effects of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines have been raised nationwide. We aimed to compare the time to report the side effects of the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccines.Information on side effects of AstraZeneca and Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccines was obtained from the COVID-19 Symptom Study App affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Science during 2021. A COX regression model with an adjusted Hazard Ratio and 95% Confidence Interval; HR (95% C.I) was reported at the significance level of < 0.05.4478 and 5555 participants received the AstraZeneca and Sinopharm vaccines, respectively; more age, history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, first vaccine dose, hypertension, and hypertension with cardiovascular disease were seen in the AstraZeneca group (<i>P</i> < 0.05 for all). However, the AstraZeneca group had lower immune deficiency and time to report the side effects (<i>P</i> < 0.05 for both). There was significantly less time to pain HR(95% C.I.); 0.50 (0.47-0.52), vertigo 0.65 (0.61-0.69), weakness 0.41 (0.38-0.44), headache 0.43 (0.39-0.74), anorexia 0.31 (0.28-0.34), nausea 0.56 (0.51-0.62), severer allergy 0.71 (0.63-0.81), general inflammation 0.27 (0.23-0.31), fever > 38oC 0.12 (0.1-0.15), eye inflammation 0.45 (0.39-0.52), diarrhea 0.85 (0.73-0.99), blurred vision 0.73 (0.61-0.86), injection site redness 0.32 (0.26-0.39), fatigue/paleness 0.53 (0.50-0.57), joint pain 0.55 (0.41-0.73), auxiliary gland inflation 0.59 (0.43-0.80), convulsions 0.30 (0.17-0.52), and severe side effects 0.3 (0.27-0.33) in the AstraZeneca group; However, skin rash 0.77 (0.57-1.05) and hospitalization 0.72 (0.21-2.55) were the same.Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine recipients reported longer times to report vaccine-related side effects than AstraZeneca; due to the lack of adverse effects like hospitalization, vaccination should continue to control the pandemic; more real-population studies are needed on the long-term effects of vaccination against COVID-19.","['Cumulative Survival Rate', 'OxfordAstraZeneca COVID19 Vaccine', 'Side Effects', 'Sinopharm BIBP COVID19 Vaccine']"
Association between ambulatory skills and diffusion tensor imaging of corpus callosal white matter in infants with spina bifida.,"To assess brain white matter using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) at 1 year of age in infants diagnosed with open neural tube defect (ONTD) and explore the association of DTI parameters with ambulatory skills at 30 months of age.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed at an average of 12 months of age and included an echo planar axial DTI sequence with diffusion gradients along 20 non-collinear directions. TORTOISE software was used to correct DTI raw data for motion artifacts, and DtiStudio, DiffeoMap and RoiEditor were used for further postprocessing. DTI data were analyzed in terms of fractional anisotropy (FA), trace, radial diffusivity and axial diffusivity. These parameters reflect the integrity and maturation of white-matter motor pathways. At 30 months of age, ambulation status was evaluated by a developmental pediatrician, and infants were classified as ambulatory if they were able to walk independently with or without orthoses or as non-ambulatory if they could not. Linear mixed-effects method was used to examine the association between study outcomes and study group. Possible confounders were sought, and analyses were adjusted for age at MRI scan and ventricular size by including them in the regression model as covariates.Twenty patients with ONTD were included in this study, including three cases that underwent postnatal repair and 17 cases that underwent prenatal repair. There were five ambulatory and 15 non-ambulatory infants evaluated at a mean age of 31.5 ± 5.7 months. MRI was performed at 50.3 (2-132.4) weeks postpartum. When DTI analysis results were compared between ambulatory and non-ambulatory infants, significant differences were observed in the corpus callosum (CC). Compared with non-ambulatory infants, ambulatory infants had increased FA in the splenium (0.62 (0.48-0.75) vs 0.41 (0.34-0.49); P = 0.01, adjusted P = 0.02), genu (0.64 (0.47-0.80) vs 0.47 (0.35-0.61); P = 0.03, adjusted P = 0.004) and body (0.55 (0.45-0.65) vs 0.40 (0.35-0.46), P = 0.01, adjusted P = 0.01). Reduced trace was observed in the CC of ambulatory children at the level of the splenium (0.0027 (0.0018-0.0037) vs 0.0039 (0.0034-0.0044) mm<sup>2</sup> /s; P = 0.04, adjusted P = 0.03) and genu (0.0029 (0.0020-0.0038) vs 0.0039 (0.0033-0.0045) mm<sup>2</sup> /s; P = 0.04, adjusted P = 0.01). In addition, radial diffusivity was reduced in the CC of the ambulatory children at the level of the splenium (0.00057 (0.00025-0.00089) vs 0.0010 (0.00084-0.00120) mm<sup>2</sup> /s; P = 0.02, adjusted P = 0.02) and the genu (0.00058 (0.00028-0.00088) vs 0.0010 (0.00085-0.00118) mm<sup>2</sup> /s; P = 0.02, adjusted P = 0.02). There were no differences in axial diffusivity between ambulatory and non-ambulatory children.This study demonstrates a significant association between white matter integrity of connecting fibers of the corpus callosum, as assessed by DTI, and ambulatory skills at 30 months of age in infants with ONTD. © 2022 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.","['development', 'fetal surgery', 'spina bifida', 'white matter']"
Post-exercise heart rate variability recovery after 800-m endurance run load among Cameroonian adolescent's males.,"The 800-m (m) run is part of Physical Education classes in Cameroon, after which arrhythmias may occur during recovery. Hence, this study aimed at determining relationship between 800-m run loads on cardiac autonomic recovery among school adolescents. Forty-two male adolescents (aged [17 ​± ​1] years) performed 800-m. Post-exercise heart rate variability (HRV) was recorded during 5-min (min) (HRV<sub>5-min)</sub> and 15-min (HRV<sub>15-min</sub>) in time: Standard deviation of normal to normal (SDNN); Root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) and frequency domain (LH: Low frequency, HF: High frequency, TP: Total power). Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) and blood lactate concentration (BLa) were measured after exercise. In HRV<sub>5-min</sub>, RPE was associated with SDNN (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.44<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.01) and RMSSD (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.38<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.05). BLa was correlated with SDNN (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.38<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.05) and RMSSD (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.56<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.001) in the time-domain, LF (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.64<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.001), HF (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.58<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.001) and TP (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.61<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.001) in frequency-domain. Moreover, RPE was correlated with LF (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.44<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.01), TP (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.49<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.01) while exercise duration with HF (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.38<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.05). In HRV<sub>15-min</sub>, BLa was correlated with RMSSD (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.53<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.001<i>)</i> and SDNN (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.68<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.001). RPE was negatively correlated SDNN (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.53<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.01) and RMSSD (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.44<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.01). BLa was associated with HF (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.55<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.001), TP (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.50<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.01) and RPE with LF (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.51<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.01), HF (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.50<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.01), TP (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.49<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.01). In addition, exercise duration was negatively linked to HF (<i>r</i> ​= ​-0.36<i>, p</i> ​< ​0.05). This study outlined that in untrained adolescents an increase of 800-m loads is associated with a slow vagal indexes of HRV during the recovery.","['800m load', 'Adolescents', 'Heart rate variability', 'Physical education classes', 'Recovery']"
Comparative evaluation of intraoperative aberrometry and Barrett's toric calculator in toric intraocular lens implantation.,"Barrett toric calculator (BTC) is known for its accuracy in toric IOL (tIOL) calculation over standard calculators; however, there is no study in literature to compare it with real-time intraoperative aberrometry (IA). The aim was to compare the accuracy of BTC and IA in predicting refractive outcomes in tIOL implantation.This was an institution-based prospective, observational study. Patients undergoing routine phacoemulsification with tIOL implantation were enrolled. Biometry was obtained from Lenstar-LS 900 and IOL power calculated using online BTC; however, IOL was implanted as per IA (Optiwave Refractive Analysis, ORA, Alcon) recommendation. Postoperative refractive astigmatism (RA) and spherical equivalent (SE) were recorded at one month, and respective prediction errors (PEs) were calculated using predicted refractive outcomes for both methods. The primary outcome measure was a comparison between mean PE with IA and BTC, and secondary outcome measures were uncorrected distance visual acuity (UCDVA), postoperative RA, and SE at one month. SPSS Version-21 was used; P < 0.05 considered significant.Thirty eyes of 29 patients were included. Mean arithmetic and mean absolute PEs for RA were comparable between BTC (-0.70 ± 0.35D; 0.70 ± 0.34D) and IA (0.77 ± 0.32D; 0.80 ± 0.39D) (P = 0.09 and 0.09, respectively). Mean arithmetic PE for residual SE was significantly lower for BTC (-0.14 ± 0.32D) than IA (0.001 ± 0.33D) (-0.14 ± 0.32D; P = 0.002); however, there was no difference between respective mean absolute PEs (0.27 ± 0.21 D; 0.27 ± 0.18; P = 0.80). At one-month, mean UCDVA, RA, and SE were 0.09 ± 0.10D, -0.57 ± 0.26D, and -0.18 ± 0.27D, respectively.Both IA and BTC give reliable and comparable refractive results for tIOL implantation.","['Barrett toric calculator', 'ORA', 'intraoperative aberrometry', 'toric IOL']"
High-accuracy detection of supraspinatus fatty infiltration in shoulder MRI using convolutional neural network algorithms.,"The supraspinatus muscle fatty infiltration (SMFI) is a crucial MRI shoulder finding to determine the patient's prognosis. Clinicians have used the Goutallier classification to diagnose it. Deep learning algorithms have been demonstrated to have higher accuracy than traditional methods.To train convolutional neural network models to categorize the SMFI as a binary diagnosis based on Goutallier's classification using shoulder MRIs.A retrospective study was performed. MRI and medical records from patients with SMFI diagnosis from January 1st, 2019, to September 20th, 2020, were selected. 900 T2-weighted, Y-view shoulder MRIs were evaluated. The supraspinatus fossa was automatically cropped using segmentation masks. A balancing technique was implemented. Five binary classification classes were developed into two as follows, A: 0, 1 v/s 3, 4; B: 0, 1 v/s 2, 3, 4; C: 0, 1 v/s 2; D: 0, 1, 2, v/s 3, 4; E: 2 v/s 3, 4. The VGG-19, ResNet-50, and Inception-v3 architectures were trained as backbone classifiers. An average of three 10-fold cross-validation processes were developed to evaluate model performance. AU-ROC, sensitivity, and specificity with 95% confidence intervals were used.Overall, 606 shoulders MRIs were analyzed. The Goutallier distribution was presented as follows: 0 = 403; 1 = 114; 2 = 51; 3 = 24; 4 = 14. Case A, VGG-19 model demonstrated an AU-ROC of 0.991 ± 0.003 (accuracy, 0.973 ± 0.006; sensitivity, 0.947 ± 0.039; specificity, 0.975 ± 0.006).

Predictors of Health-Related Quality of Life in Korean Adults with Diabetes Mellitus.,"Diabetes mellitus (DM) as a chronic disease is a major public health problem worldwide. It is important to improve the quality of life of people with DM, especially health-related aspects, which should be monitored and managed as part of diabetes management. Accordingly, this study investigated health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and identified predictors of HRQoL in Korean adults with DM using the Seventh Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES VII) 2016-2018. This was a cross-sectional study with a stratified multistage probability sampling design that collected data from 1228 participants aged 30-80 years diagnosed with DM. HRQoL was measured using the Euro Quality of Life Five Dimension (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Analyses consisted of one-way analysis of variance, <i>t</i>-tests, chi-squared tests, and general linear regression analyses with complex sampling designs. Results demonstrated that low HRQoL was associated with older age (<i>β</i> = -0.002, 95% CI: -0.003 to -0.001), having elementary school education or less (<i>β</i> = -0.037, 95% CI: -0.061 to -0.014), being unmarried (<i>β</i> = -0.060, 95% CI: -0.078 to -0.040), poor subjective health status (<i>β</i> = -0.074, 95% CI: -0.094 to -0.055), perceived high stress (<i>β</i> = -0.047, 95% CI: -0.066 to -0.028), limited activity (<i>β</i> = -0.105, 95% CI: -0.131 to -0.079), being overweight (<i>β</i> = -0.021, 95% CI: -0.038 to -0.002), or obese (<i>β</i> = -0.016, 95% CI: -0.032 to -0.001), and three or more comorbidities (<i>β</i> = -0.044, 95% CI: -0.085 to -0.001). Comprehensive health care programs to manage these predictors should be provided to improve health-related quality of life of patients with DM.","['Euro Quality of Life Five Dimension EQ5D', 'Korean adults', 'diabetes mellitus DM', 'healthrelated quality of life HRQoL']"

Individual patient data were taken from the SWEDEHEART registry. Patients were divided by age (< 60, 60-69, 70-79, ≥ 80 years), sex, and surgical risk (low: EuroSCORE < 4%, intermediate: 4-8%, high: > 8%). Discriminative accuracy was determined by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration by the observed/estimated (O/E) mortality ratio at 30 days.AUC and O/E ratio were 0.82 (95% CI 0.79-0.85) and 0.58 (0.50-0.66) overall, 0.82 (0.79-0.86) and 0.57 (0.48-0.66) in men, and 0.79 (0.73-0.85) and 0.60 (0.47-0.75) in women. Regarding age, discriminative accuracy was highest in patients aged 60-69 years (AUC: 0.86 [0.80-0.93]) but was satisfactory in all groups (AUC: 0.74-0.80). O/E ratio varied from 0.26 for patients > 60 years to 0.90 for patients > 80 years. Regarding surgical risk, AUC and O/E ratio were 0.63 (0.44-0.83) and 0.18 (0.09-0.30) in low-risk patients, 0.60 (0.55-0.66) and 0.57 (0.46-0.68) in intermediate-risk patients, and 0.78 (0.73-0.83) and 0.78 (0.64-0.92) in high-risk patients.EuroSCORE II had good discriminative accuracy independently of sex and age, but markedly overestimated mortality risk, especially in younger patients. Accuracy and calibration were better in high-risk patients than in low-risk and intermediate-risk patients.","['Coronary artery bypass grafting', 'EuroSCORE', 'Mortality', 'Risk stratification']"
Dyspnea on Exercise Is Associated with Overall Symptom Burden in Patients with Chronic Respiratory Insufficiency.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency suffer from many symptoms together with dyspnea. <b><i>Objective:</i></b> We evaluated the association of dyspnea on exercise with other symptoms in patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency due to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or interstitial lung disease. <b><i>Design:</i></b> This retrospective study included 101 patients in Tampere University Hospital, Finland. Dyspnea on exercise was assessed with modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) dyspnea questionnaire, and other symptoms were assessed with Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) and Depression Scale (DEPS). The study was approved by Regional Ethics Committee of Tampere University Hospital, Finland (approval code R15180/December 1, 2015). <b><i>Results:</i></b> Patients with mMRC 4 (most severe dyspnea) compared with those with mMRC 0-3 reported higher symptom scores on ESAS in shortness of breath (median 8.0 [IQR 6.0-9.0] vs. 4.0 [2.0-6.0], <i>p</i> < 0.001), dry mouth (7.0 [4.0-8.0] vs. 3.0 [1.0-6.0], <i>p</i> < 0.001), tiredness (6.0 [3.0-7.0] vs. 3.0 [1.0-5.0], <i>p</i> < 0.001), loss of appetite (3.0 [0.0-6.0] vs. 1.0 [0.0-3.0], <i>p</i> = 0.001), insomnia (3.0 [1.0-7.0] vs. 2.0 [0.0-3.0], <i>p</i> = 0.027), anxiety (3.0 [0.0-5.5] vs. 1.0 [0.0-3.0], <i>p</i> = 0.007), and nausea (0.0 [0.0-2.0] vs. 0.0 [0.0-0.3], <i>p</i> = 0.027). Patients with mMRC 4 were more likely to reach the DEPS threshold for depression than those scoring mMRC 0-3 (42.1% vs. 20.8%, <i>p</i> = 0.028). <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Patients with chronic respiratory insufficiency need comprehensive symptom screening with relevant treatment, as they suffer from broad symptom burden worsening with increased dyspnea on exercise.","['Edmonton Symptom Assessment System', 'chronic obstructive pulmonary disease', 'chronic respiratory insufficiency', 'dyspnea on exercise', 'interstitial lung disease', 'modified Medical Research Council dyspnea questionnaire']"
Comparison of thermal ablative methods and myomectomy for the treatment of fibroids: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To examine the effectiveness and safety of thermal ablative methods and myomectomy for the treatment of uterine fibroids.We searched EMBASE, PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Scopus, CINAHL, ClinicalTrials.gov and Web of Science databases through April 2021. Clinical trials comparing the thermal ablative methods and myomectomy for the treatment of uterine fibroids were included.Thirteen studies including 4205 patients were eligible. The thermal ablative treatment group was associated with less major adverse events (only ultrasound guided high-intensity focused ultrasound) (RR, 0.111 [95% CI, 0.070-0.175], <i>p</i>=.0), shorter duration of hospital stays in observational studies (-0.1497 day, [95% CI, -1.593 to -0.321], <i>p</i>=.0) and in randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (-0.844 day, [95% CI, -0.1.142 to -0.546], <i>p</i>=.0), higher uterine fibroid symptom (UFS) score after operation (0.252 [95% CI, 0.165-0.339]; <i>p</i>=.0), transformed symptom severity (tSS) score after operation (0.515 [95% CI, 0.355-0.674]; <i>p</i>=.0) and quality of life (QoL) score after operation (0.188 [95% CI, 0.093-0.283]; <i>p</i>=.0) in comparison with myomectomy group. No statistically significant difference was found between the thermal ablative treatment group and myomectomy group with respect to reintervention rate and pregnancy rate.The current data available demonstrate that thermal ablative methods were not inferior to myomectomy in the treatment of uterine fibroids. The findings in this study need to be further confirmed by large RCTs.","['Focused ultrasound', 'metaanalysis', 'myomectomy', 'radiofrequency ablation', 'uterine fibroids']"
Factors That Influence Compliance to Long-Term Remote Ischemic Conditioning Treatment in Patients With Ischemic Stroke.,"<b>Objectives:</b> To investigate the treatment compliance of patients with ischemic stroke to remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) and to determine the factors that influence compliance. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a retrospective study of patients with ischemic stroke who were treated with RIC. Treatment compliance was determined and analyzed in patients who had received 1 year of RIC training. Factors that influenced patient compliance were also determined using univariate and multivariate regression analyses. <b>Results:</b> Between March 2017 and February 2018, 91 patients were recruited into this study. The mean (±SD) age was 57.98 ± 10.76 years, and 78 (85.7%) patients were male. The baseline Kolcaba comfort scale of patients with good compliance scores were higher than those with poor compliance. The scores of the four dimensions in the scale and the total score are as follows: physiological dimensions, 15.0 (12.0,17.0) vs 17.0 (13.0,19.0); psychological dimensions, 30.0 (25.0,34.0) vs 31.0 (27.0,35.0); sociological dimensions, 20.0 (18.0,24.0) vs 21.0 (18.0,23.0); environmental dimensions, 19.0 (12.0,24.0) vs 20.0 (17.0,22.0); and total points, 82.0 (69.0,94.0) vs 91.0 (78.0,98.0). the differences between the groups were significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05), except for the sociological dimensions. A history of hypertension, number of follow-ups, and the physiological, psychological, and environmental dimensions of the comfort scale were related to patient compliance, out of which the number of follow-ups (Adjusted OR = 2.498, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.257-4.964) and the physiological discomfort (Adjusted OR = 1.128, 95% CI 1.029-1.236) independently influenced compliance (<i>p</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> In patients with ischemic cerebrovascular disease who were treated with RIC, the number of follow-up visits and physiological discomfort associated with RIC treatment independently influenced patient compliance. Further studies are needed to investigate the RIC protocols and their corresponding nursing models.","['influencing factor', 'ischemic stroke', 'patient compliance', 'remote ischemic conditioning', 'secondary prevention']"
Performance of microbiological tests for tuberculosis diagnostic according to the type of respiratory specimen: A 10-year retrospective study.,"The microbial diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) remains challenging and relies on multiple microbiological tests performed on different clinical specimens. Polymerase chain reactions (PCRs), introduced in the last decades has had a significant impact on the diagnosis of TB. However, questions remain about the use of PCRs in combination with conventional tests for TB, namely microscopy and culture. We aimed to determine the performance of microscopy, culture and PCR for the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis according to the type of clinical specimen in order to improve the diagnostic yield and to avoid unnecessary, time and labor-intensive tests.We conducted a retrospective study (2008-2018) on analysis (34'429 specimens, 14'358 patients) performed in our diagnostic laboratory located in the Lausanne University Hospital to compare the performance of microbiological tests on sputum, induced sputum, bronchial aspirate and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). We analysed the performance using a classical ""per specimen"" approach and a ""per patient"" approach for paired specimens collected from the same patient.The overall sensitivities of microscopy, PCR and culture were 0.523 (0.489, 0.557), 0.798 (0.755, 0.836) and 0.988 (0.978, 0.994) and the specificity were 0.994 (0.993, 0.995), 1 (0.999, 1) and 1 (1, 1). Microscopy displayed no significant differences in sensitivity according to the type of sample. The sensitivities of PCR for sputum, induced sputum, bronchial aspirate and BAL were, 0.821 (0.762, 0.871), 0.643 (0.480, 0.784), 0.837 (0.748, 0.904) and 0.759 (0.624, 0.865) respectively and the sensitivity of culture were, 0.993 (0.981, 0.998), 0.980 (0.931, 0.998), 0.965 (0.919, 0.988), and 1 (0.961, 1) respectively. Pairwise comparison of specimens collected from the same patient reported a significantly higher sensitivity of PCR on bronchial aspirate over BAL (p < 0.001) and sputum (p < 0.05) and a significantly higher sensitivity of culture on bronchial aspirate over BAL (p < 0.0001).PCR displayed a higher sensitivity and specificity than microscopy for all respiratory specimens, a rational for a smear-independent PCR-based approach to initiate tuberculosis microbial diagnostic. The diagnosis yield of bronchial aspirate was higher than BAL. Therefore, PCR should be systematically performed also on bronchial aspirates when available.","['PCR', 'acidfast bacilli AFB', 'bronchial aspirate', 'bronchoalveolar lavage BAL', 'inducedsputum', 'mycobacterial culture', 'sputum', 'tuberculosis']"
The Role of NEWS2 + Lactate + D-Dimer in Predicting Intensive Care Unit Admission and In-Hospital Mortality of COVID-19 Patients.,"We investigated the parameters of National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2) + lactate + D-dimer in predicting the intensive care unit (ICU) admission and in-hospital mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.Patients, who applied to the emergency department of a tertiary university hospital and were taken to the COVID-19 zone with suspected COVID-19 between March 2020 and June 2020, were retrospectively examined. In this study, 244 patients, who were hospitalized and had positive polymerase chain reaction test results, were included. NEWS2, lactate, and D-dimer levels of the patients were recorded. Patients were grouped by the states of in-hospital mortality and ICU admission.Of 244 patients who were included in the study, 122 (50%) were male, while their mean age was 53.76 ± 17.36 years. 28 (11.5%) patients were admitted to the ICU, while in-hospital mortality was seen in 14 (5.7%) patients. The levels of D-dimer, NEWS2, NEWS2 + lactate, NEWS2 + D-dimer, NEWS2 + lactate + D-dimer were statistically significantly higher in patients with in-hospital mortality and admitted to ICU ( <i>p</i> < 0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) values of D-dimer, lactate, NEWS2, NEWS2 + lactate, NEWS2 + D-dimer, NEWS2 + lactate + D-dimer in predicting ICU admission were as 0.745 (0.658-0.832), 0.589 (0.469-0.710), 0.760 (0.675-0.845), 0.774 (0.690-0.859), 0.776 (0.692-0.860), and 0.778 (0.694-0.862), respectively; while the AUC values of these parameters in predicting in-hospital mortality were found to be as 0.768 (0.671-0.865), 0.695 (0.563-0.827), 0.735 (0.634-0.836), 0.757 (0.647-0.867), 0.752 (0.656-0.848), and 0.764 (0.655-0.873), respectively.Compared to using the NEWS2 value alone, a combination of NEWS2, lactate, and D-dimer was found to be more valuable in predicting in-hospital mortality and ICU admission.","['COVID19', 'hospital mortality', 'intensive care unit']"
Mortality Risks after Two Years in Frail and Pre-Frail Older Adults Admitted to Hospital.,"Frailty is characterized by a progressive decline in the physiological functions of multiple body systems that lead to a more vulnerable condition, which is prone to the development of various adverse events, such as falls, hospitalization, and mortality. This study aims to determine whether frailty increases mortality compared to pre-frailty and to identify variables associated with a higher risk of mortality.Two cohorts, frail and pre-frail subjects, are evaluated according to the Fried phenotype. A complete examination of frailty, cognitive status, comorbidities and pharmacology was carried out at hospital admission and was extracted through electronic health record (EHR). Mortality was evaluated from the EHR.Kaplan-Meier estimates of survival probability functions were calculated at two years censoring time for frail and pre-frail cohorts. The log-rank test assessed significant differences between survival probability functions. Significant variables for frailty (<i>p</i> < 0-05) were extracted by independent sample <i>t</i>-test. Further selection was based on variable significance found in multivariate logistic regression discrimination between frail and pre-frail subjects. Cox regression over univariate <i>t</i>-test-selected variables was calculated to identify variables associated with higher proportional hazard risks (HR) at two years.Frailty is associated with greater mortality at two years censoring time than pre-frailty (log-rank test, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). Variables with significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) association with mortality identified in both cohorts (HR 95% (CI in the frail cohort) are male sex (0.44 (0.29-0.66)), age (1.05 (1.01-1.09)), weight (0.98 (0.96-1.00)), and use of proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) (0.60 (0.41-0.87)). Specific high-risk factors in the frail cohort are readmission at 30 days (0.50 (0.33-0.74)), SPPB sit and stand (0.62 (0.45-0.85)), heart failure (0.67 (0.46-0.98)), use of antiplatelets (1.80 (1.19-2.71)), and quetiapine (0.31 (0.12-0.81)). Specific high-risk factors in the pre-frail cohort are Barthel's score (120 (7.7-1700)), Pfeiffer test (8.4; (2.3-31)), Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA) (1200 (18-88,000)), constipation (0.025 (0.0027-0.24)), falls (18,000 (150-2,200,000)), deep venous thrombosis (8400 (19-3,700,000)), cerebrovascular disease (0.01 (0.00064-0.16)), diabetes (360 (3.4-39,000)), thyroid disease (0.00099 (0.000012-0.085)), and the use of PPIs (0.062 (0.0072-0.54)), Zolpidem (0.000014 (0.0000000021-0.092)), antidiabetics (0.00015 (0.00000042-0.051)), diuretics (0.0003 (0.000004-0.022)), and opiates (0.000069 (0.00000035-0.013)).Frailty is associated with higher mortality at two years than pre-frailty. Frailty is recognized as a systemic syndrome with many links to older-age comorbidities, which are also found in our study. Polypharmacy is strongly associated with frailty, and several commonly prescribed drugs are strongly associated with increased mortality. It must be considered that frail patients need coordinated attention where the diverse specialist taking care of them jointly examines the interactions between the diversity of treatments prescribed.","['frail', 'frailty', 'fried frailty scale', 'mortality', 'prefrail', 'survival']"
Effects of added dietary salt on pig growth performance<sup></sup>.,"Three studies evaluated the effects of added dietary salt on growth performance of pigs weighing 7 to 10, 11 to 30, and 27 to 65 kg. In experiment 1, 325 pigs were used with 5 pigs per pen and 13 pens per treatment. Pigs were fed a diet (0.39% Na and 0.78% Cl) for 7 d after weaning, then randomly assigned to diets with either 0, 0.20, 0.40, 0.60, or 0.80% added salt for 14 d. All diets were corn-soybean meal-based with 10% dried whey. Calculated Na concentrations were 0.11, 0.19, 0.27, 0.35, and 0.43% and calculated Cl concentrations were 0.23, 0.35, 0.47, 0.59, and 0.70%, respectively. Increasing salt increased (linear, <i>P <</i> 0.05) average daily gain (ADG) and gain to feed ratio (<b>G:F</b>). For ADG, the linear, quadratic polynomial (<b>QP</b>), and broken-line linear (<b>BLL</b>) models were competing with the breakpoint for the BLL at 0.59% salt. For G:F, the BLL reported a breakpoint at 0.33% while the QP indicated maximum G:F at 0.67% added salt. In experiment 2, 300 pigs were used in a 34-d trial with 5 pigs per pen and 12 pens per treatment. Pigs were weaned at 21 d of age and fed a phase 1 diet (0.50% Na and 0.67% Cl) for 11 d and then a phase 2 diet (0.35% Na and 0.59% Cl) for 14 d. Then pens of pigs were randomly assigned to corn-soybean meal-based diets containing 0.20, 0.35, 0.50, 0.65, or 0.80% added salt. Calculated dietary Na concentration were 0.10, 0.16, 0.22, 0.28, and 0.34% and calculated Cl concentrations were 0.23, 0.32, 0.41, 0.50, and 0.59%, respectively. Overall, ADG and G:F increased (quadratic, <i>P <</i> 0.07) with increasing added salt. For ADG, the QP and BLL had similar fit with the breakpoint for BLL at 0.51% added salt. For G:F, the BLL model predicted a break point at 0.35% added salt. In experiment 3, 1,188 pigs were used in a 44-d study with 27 pigs per pen and 11 pens per treatment. Pens of pigs were randomly assigned to corn-soybean meal-based diets containing 0.10, 0.33, 0.55, or 0.75% added salt. Calculated dietary Na concentrations were 0.10, 0.19, 0.28, and 0.36% and calculated Cl concentrations were 0.23, 0.36, 0.49, and 0.61%, respectively. Overall, there was no evidence to indicate that added salt above 0.10% of the diet affected growth. In conclusion, the BLL models suggested to maximize ADG for 7 to 10 and 11 to 30 kg pigs was 0.59% (0.34% Na and 0.58% Cl) and 0.51% added salt (0.22% Na and 0.42% Cl), respectively. There was no evidence that growth of 27 to 65 kg pigs was improved beyond 0.10% added salt (0.11% Na and 0.26% Cl).","['chloride', 'growth', 'pig', 'salt', 'sodium']"
The Interplay Between Systemic Inflammatory Factors and MicroRNAs in Age-Related Macular Degeneration.,"We aimed to explore the expression of systemic inflammatory factors and selected intracellular miRNAs that regulate inflammatory signaling pathways potentially involved in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) pathogenesis. A total of 179 patients with wet AMD, 175 with dry AMD and 121 controls were enrolled in the study. Soluble inflammatory factors were analyzed in plasma samples using Luminex technology. Expression of selected miRNAs was analyzed in isolated nucleated peripheral blood cells (PBNCs) using real-time qPCR. Wet AMD was an independent factor associated with higher concentrations of IL-6 (β = +0.24, <i>p</i> = 0.0004), GM-CSF (β = +0.31, <i>p</i> < 0.001), IFN-γ (β = +0.58, <i>p</i> < 0.001), higher expression of miRNA-23a-3p (β = +0.60, <i>p</i> < 0.0001), miRNA-30b (β = +0.32, <i>p</i> < 0.0001), miRNA-191-5p (β = +0.28, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and lower concentration of IL-1β (β = -0.25, <i>p</i> = 0.0003), IL-5 (β = -0.45, <i>p</i> < 0.001), IL-10 (β = -0.45, <i>p</i> < 0.001), IL-12 (β = -0.35, <i>p</i> < 0.001), lower expression of miRNA-16-5p (β = -0.31, <i>p</i> < 0.0001), miRNA-17-3p (β = -0.18, <i>p</i> = 0.01), miRNA-150-5p (β = -0.18, <i>p</i> = 0.01) and miRNA-155-5p (β = -0.47, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). Multivariate analysis revealed that dry AMD was an independent factor associated with higher concentration of GM-CSF (β = +0.34, <i>p</i> < 0.001), IL-6 (β = +0.13, <i>p</i> = 0.05), higher expression of miRNA-23a-3p (β = +0.60, <i>p</i> < 0.0001), miRNA-126-3p (β = +0.23, <i>p</i> = 0.0005), miRNA-126-5p (β = +0.16, <i>p</i> = 0.01), miRNA 146a (β = +0.14, <i>p</i> = 0.03), and mRNA191-5p (β = +0.15, <i>p</i> = 0.03) and lower concentrations of TNF-α (β = +0.24, <i>p</i> = 0.0004), IL-1β (β = -0.39, <i>p</i> < 0.001), IL-2 (β = -0.20, <i>p</i> = 0.003), IL-5 (β = -0.54, <i>p</i> < 0.001), IL-10 (β = -0.56, <i>p</i> < 0.001), IL-12 (β = -0.51, <i>p</i> < 0.001), lower expression of miRNA-16-5p (β = -0.23, <i>p</i> = 0.0004), miRNA-17-3p (β = -0.20, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and miRNA-17-5p (β = -0.19, <i>p</i> = 0.004). Negative correlations between visual acuity and WBC, lymphocyte count, TNF-α, IL-1 β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10 concentrations and miRNA-191-5p, as well as positive correlations between visual acuity and miRNA-126-3p, -126-5p, and -155-5p PBNCs expression were found in AMD patients. No such correlations were found in the control group. Our results may suggest the role of both intra- and extracellular mechanisms implicated in inflammatory response regulation in multifactorial AMD pathogenesis.","['cytokines', 'inflammation', 'interleukin', 'macular degeneration', 'miRNA']"
Associations Between Carotid Plaque Characteristics and Perioperative Cerebral Blood Flow Determined by Arterial Spin Labeling Imaging in Patients With Moderate-to-Severe Stenosis Undergoing Carotid Endarterectomy.,"To examine the associations between carotid plaque characteristics and perioperative cerebral blood flow (CBF) by arterial spin labeling (ASL) imaging.Patients with unilateral moderate-to-severe carotid stenosis referred for carotid endarterectomy (CEA) were recruited and underwent carotid vessel wall and brain ASL magnetic resonance imaging. The following imaging features were measured: relative CBF (rCBF = CBF<sub>index-<i>hemisphere</i></sub> /CBF<sub>contralateral-<i>hemisphere</i></sub> ) in the middle cerebral artery territory; plaque burden and the presence of lipid-rich necrotic core; intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH); calcification; ulcer and fibrous-cap rupture; and the volume and maximum plaque components' area percentages. The associations between plaque characteristics and perioperative CBF were analyzed.Sixty-one patients (mean age, 66.6 ± 7.8 years; 55 males) were included. Univariate linear regression showed that rCBF<sub>pre-CEA</sub> was associated with stenosis [β, -0.462; 95% confidence interval (CI), from -0.797 to -0.126; <i>p</i> = 0.008], calcification (β, 0.103; 95% CI, 0.005-0.201; <i>p</i> = 0.040), maximum IPH area percentage (β, -0.127; 95% CI, from -0.223 to -0.030; <i>p</i> = 0.012), and ulcer (β, 0.069; 95% CI, 0.025-0.113; <i>p</i> = 0.005); rCBF<sub>post-CEA</sub> was associated with the IPH volume (β, -0.060; 95% CI, from -0.107 to -0.014; <i>p</i> = 0.013). After adjusting for the confounding factors, the associations of calcification with rCBF<sub>pre-CEA</sub> (β, 0.099; 95% CI, from 0.004 to -0.194; <i>p</i> = 0.042) and IPH volume with rCBF<sub>post-CEA</sub> (β, -0.060; 95% CI, from -0.109 to -0.011; <i>p</i> = 0.020) remained statistically significant, while those of rCBF<sub>pre-CEA</sub> with maximum IPH area percentage (β, -0.089; 95% CI, from -0.188 to 0.011; <i>p</i> = 0.080) and ulcer (β, 0.050; 95% CI, from -0.012 to 0.112; <i>p</i> = 0.100) did not remain statistically significant.The compositional characteristics of carotid atherosclerotic plaques, particularly IPH, were associated with perioperative CBF in patients with unilateral moderate-to-severe carotid stenosis undergoing CEA. Our findings indicated that the patients with larger carotid IPH could expect smaller improvement in CBF following CEA.","['arterial spin labeling', 'carotid atherosclerosis', 'carotid endarterectomy', 'cerebral blood flow', 'magnetic resonance imaging']"
"Sex Differences in the Mediating Effect of Kinesiophobia on Chronic Pain, Dysesthesia, and Health-Related Quality of Life in Japanese Individuals Aged 65 Years Old and Older Treated with Surgery for Lumbar Spinal Stenosis.","This study aimed to determine whether kinesiophobia mediates the relationship between low back pain (LBP), leg pain (LP), and leg dysesthesia (LD) and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among Japanese individuals aged 65 years old and older treated with surgery for lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS).Data collection for this study took place between October 2019 and August 2020 at two Japanese medical facilities. Eligibility criteria for participants in this study were individuals aged 65 years or older and those who had undergone surgery for LSS at least more than one year ago. A self-administered questionnaire assessed the intensity of LBP, LP, and LD (numerical rating scale: NRS), HRQOL (EuroQol-5 Dimension-5 Levels: EQ-5D-5L), and kinesiophobia (Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia-17 items: TSK-17). Mediation analysis using sex as a control variable was conducted.Complete responses were obtained from 238 of 431 individuals (73.1 ± 5.1 years; 135 males and 103 females). The mediating effect of NRS scores for LBP, LP, and LD to EQ-5D-5L index on TSK-17 score was significant, respectively (LBP: -0.007 [95% confidence interval -0.012, -0.004], p = 0.000; LP and LD: -0.007 [-0.011, -0.004], p = 0.000). The strength of the association between NRS scores and EQ-5D-5L index decreased when the mediating effect of TSK-17 score (LBP: β = -0.698 [-0.792, -0.603], p = 0.000 to β = -0.616 [-0.707, -0.524], p = 0.000; LP: β = -0.629 [-0.729, -0.529], p = 0.000 to β = -0.539 [-0.638, -0.440], p = 0.000; LD: β = -0.568 [-0.675, -0.460], p = 0.000 to β = -0.482 [-0.586, -0.378], p = 0.000).

"Nutrition risk, physical activity and fibre intake are associated with body composition in OA: analysis of the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging.","Sarcopenic obesity is a key feature in osteoarthritis (OA). While ideal OA treatment involves physical activity and diet, how diet influences OA pathophysiology is unclear. We explored the associations between diet, nutrition risk and physical activity with body composition in older adults with OA.Baseline data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging data set were analysed. Participants with hip, knee, hand or multiple forms of OA were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Body composition measures (lean, fat and total masses (kg) and body fat percentage) were separate dependent variables. Regression analyses were conducted to explore associations between body composition with dietary intake (high calorie snack, fibre), nutrition risk (SCREEN II) and physical activity (Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly).1596 participants were 66.5 (9.0) years old with a body mass index of 28.2 (5.3) kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Higher fibre cereal intake was associated with higher lean mass (unstandardised beta coefficient 0.5 (0.1, 0.9), p=0.02) and lower body fat percentage (-0.3 (-0.6, 0.0), p=0.046). Lower nutrition risk was associated with higher lean mass (0.1 (0.0, 0.1), p=0.03), lower fat mass (-0.05 (-0.1, 0.0), p=0.009) and lower body fat percentage (-0.1 (-0.1, 0.0), p<0.001). Higher physical activity was associated with higher lean mass (0.01 (0.01, 0.02), p<0.001), lower fat mass (-0.01 (0.0, 0.0), p=0.005) and lower body fat percentage (-0.01 (0.0, 0.0), p<0.001).Greater physical activity and lower nutrition risk were associated with better body composition. While fibre intake was also associated body composition, the CIs were wide suggesting weak associations.","['musculoskeletal health', 'nutrition assessment', 'physical performance']"
Ultrasound score combined with liver stiffness measurement by sound touch elastography for staging liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B: a clinical prospective study.,"A noninvasive and precise diagnosis of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) is crucial for establishing the optimal time and strategy of therapy and for predicting treatment response. This study aimed to assess the diagnostic performance of ultrasound (US) score and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) of sound touch elastography (STE) in diagnosing liver fibrosis stages and to investigate whether combining these methods would improve liver fibrosis staging.US and STE examinations were performed in CHB patients included. Liver biopsy was used as a reference standard. A diagnostic marker with the optimal linear combination (LC) of US score and LSM of STE, namely LC marker, was established for noninvasive assessment of liver fibrosis stages. The diagnostic performance of the LC marker was evaluated by using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the ROC curve (AUC).A total of 291 subjects, including 242 patients with CHB and 49 healthy volunteers, were included. Correlation analysis showed that the correlation of liver fibrosis stages to the LC marker (Spearman's r=0.846, P<0.001) was higher than that of LSM (r=0.771, P<0.001) or US score (r=0.825, P<0.001) alone. The results showed that the overall diagnostic performance of the LC marker in predicting a fibrosis stage of ≥F1, ≥F2, ≥F3, and =F4 {AUCs: 0.943 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.917-0.948], 0.906 (0.871-0.915), 0.953 (0.923-0.969), and 0.961 (0.922-0.973), respectively} were better than those of the US score [AUCs: 0.916 (0.883-0.948, P=0.014), 0.875 (0.835-0.915, P<0.001), 0.934 (0.898-0.969, P=0.001), and 0.918 (0.864-0.973, P<0.001), respectively] or LSM [AUCs: 0.858 (0.812-0.948, P<0.001), 0.867 (0.826-0.915, P=0.006), 0.930 (0.894-0.969, P<0.023), and 0.958 (0.918-0.973, P=0.778), respectively].The LC marker with the optimal combination of LSM and US score may be considered as a promising diagnostic model for noninvasive staging of liver fibrosis.","['Ultrasound', 'chronic hepatitis B CHB', 'liver fibrosis staging', 'liver stiffness measurement LSM', 'sound touch elastography STE']"
Comparisons of six endoscopy independent scoring systems for the prediction of clinical outcomes for elderly and younger patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.,"To compare the predictive ability of six pre-endoscopic scoring systems (ABC, AIMS65, GBS, MAP(ASH), pRS, and T-score) for outcomes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) in elderly and younger patients.A retrospective study of 1260 patients, including 530 elderly patients (age [Formula: see text] 65) and 730 younger patients (age < 65) presenting with UGIB, was performed at Zhongda Hospital Southeast University, from January 2015 to December 2020. Six scoring systems were used.ABC had the largest areas under the curve (AUCs) of 0.827 (0.792-0.858), and 0.958 (0.929-0.987) for elderly and younger groups for predicting mortality respectively. The differences of the AUCs for predicting the outcome of mortality and rebleeding between the two groups were significant for ABC and pRS (p < 0.01). For intervention prediction, significant differences were observed only for pRS [AUC 0.623 (0.578-0.669) vs. 0.699 (0.646-0.752)] (p < 0.05) between the two groups. For intensive care unit (ICU) admission, the AUC for MAP (ASH) [0.791 (0.718-0.865) vs. 0.891 (0.831-0.950)] and pRS [0.610 (0.514-0.706) vs. 0.891 (0.699-0.865)] were more effective for the younger group (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01, respectively). For comparison of scoring systems in the same cohort, ABC was significantly higher than pRS: AUC 0.710 (0.699-0.853, p < 0.05) and T-score 0.670 (0.628-0.710, p < 0.01) for predicting mortality in the elderly group. In the younger group, ABC was significantly higher than GBS and T-score (p < 0.01). MAP(ASH) performs the best in predicting intervention in both groups.ABC and pRS are more accurate for predicting mortality and rebleeding in the younger cohort, and pRS may not be suitable for elderly patients. There was no difference between the two study populations for GBS, AIMS65, and T-score. Except for ICU admission, MAP(ASH) showed fair accuracy for both cohorts.","['Comparision', 'Elderly patients', 'ROC curve', 'Scoring system', 'Upper gastrointestinal bleeding UGIB']"
Limits of Detection in Acute-Phase Protein Biomarkers Affect Inflammation Correction of Serum Ferritin for Quantifying Iron Status among School-Age and Preschool-Age Children and Reproductive-Age Women.,"Standardized practices are needed in the analysis of inflammation biomarker values outside limits of detection (LODs) when used for inflammation correction of nutritional biomarkers.We assessed the direction and extent to which serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and α-1-acid-glycoprotein (AGP) values outside LODs (<0.05 mg/L and >4.0 g/L, respectively) affect inflammation regression correction of serum ferritin and compared approaches to addressing such values when estimating inflammation-adjusted ferritin and iron deficiency (ID).We examined 29 cross-sectional datasets from 7 countries with reproductive-age women (age 15-49 y) (n = 12,944), preschool-age children (age 6-59 mo) (n = 18,208), and school-age children (age 6-14 y) (n = 4625). For each dataset, we compared 6 analytic approaches for addressing CRP <LOD: listwise deletion, single imputation (lower, middle, or upper bound; LOD/√2; random number), with multiple imputation (MI). For each approach, inflammation-adjusted ferritin and ID using BRINDA (Biomarkers Reflecting Inflammation and Nutritional Determinants of Anemia) regression correction were estimated. We calculated deviance of each estimate from that given by MI within each dataset and performed fixed-effects multivariate meta-regression with an analytic approach as a moderator to compare the reliability of each approach to MI.Across datasets, observations outside LOD ranged from 0.0 to 35.0% of CRP values and 0.0 to 2.5% of AGP values. Pooled deviance estimates for mean ferritin (μg/L) and ID (percentage points) were: listwise deletion -0.46 (95% CI: -0.76, -0.16) and 0.14 (-0.43, 0.72), lower bound 0.45 (0.14, 0.76) and -0.36 (-0.91, 0.20), middle bound -0.21 (-0.51, 0.09) and 0.22 (-0.34, 0.79), LOD/√2 -0.26 (-0.57, 0.04) and 0.25 (-0.31, 0.81), upper bound -0.31 (-0.61, -0.01) and 0.30 (-0.27, 0.86), and random number -0.08 (-0.38, 0.22) and 0.11 (-0.46, 0.67). There was moderation by approach in the ferritin model (P < 0.001).These findings demonstrate the need for standardized analyses of inflammation biomarker values outside LODs and suggest that random number single imputation may be a reliable and feasible alternative to MI for CRP <LOD.","['acute phase proteins', 'imputation', 'inflammation', 'iron deficiency', 'left censored', 'limit of detection', 'regression correction']"
Assessment of Saxagliptin Efficacy: Meta-Analysis of 14 Phase 2 and 3 Clinical Trials.,"This meta-analysis of data from 14 phase 2 and 3, double-blind, randomized, controlled 12- and 24-week studies (N = 4632) summarizes saxagliptin efficacy in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) across treatment regimens.Patients received saxagliptin 5 mg/d or control as either monotherapy (n = 1196 vs placebo), add-on therapy (n = 2139 vs placebo and n = 514 vs uptitrated sulfonylurea), or initial combination therapy (n = 619 vs control monotherapy). Patients with renal impairment received saxagliptin 2.5 mg/d or placebo (n = 164).Mean baseline glycated hemoglobin (A1C) ranged from 8.07% to 9.43% for the saxagliptin and control groups across treatment regimens. A1C reduction from baseline was greater with saxagliptin versus control for all studies combined (mean treatment difference [95% CI]: -0.55% [-0.63%, -0.47%]) and when used as monotherapy (-0.52% [-0.63, -0.40%]), add-on (-0.55% [-0.69%, -0.40%] vs placebo; -0.72% [-0.88%, -0.56%] vs uptitrated sulfonylurea), initial combination therapy (-0.54% [-0.73%, -0.35%] vs control monotherapy), and in patients with renal impairment (-0.42% [-0.75%, -0.09%]). Similar reductions in A1C versus control were noted for patients <65 years (-0.55% [-0.67%, -0.43%]) and ≥65 years (-0.54% [-0.69%, -0.38%]) and for men (-0.54% [-0.69%, -0.40%]) and women (-0.55% [-0.64%, -0.47%]) across treatment regimens. More patients achieved A1C <7% (39% vs 23%) and A1C ≤6.5% (24% vs 14%) with saxagliptin than with placebo or active-control treatment. Saxagliptin versus control was associated with a reduction in glucagon area under the curve (AUC) from baseline and increases in insulin AUC, C-peptide AUC, and the homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function.Results of this meta-analysis demonstrate the consistency of saxagliptin efficacy in different subgroups of patients with T2D across treatment regimens.AstraZeneca.","['Dipeptidyl peptidase4 DPP4 inhibitor', 'Incretin enhancer', 'Metaanalysis', 'Saxagliptin', 'Type 2 diabetes']"
A system review and meta-analysis of the treatment of acute angle-closure glaucoma under optical coherence tomography.,"A meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the value of treatment-related indicators of acute angle-closure glaucoma (AACG) based on optical coherence tomography (OCT) to evaluate the curative effect.Articles on the treatment of AACG in clinical research of OCT published from January 2010 to June 2020 were retrieved from the PubMed, Web of Science, and Spring databases. RevMan 5.3 software was used for the meta-analysis of the relevant data. The angle opening distance (AOD), trabecular-iris space area (TISA), angle recess area (ARA), anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior chamber width (ACW), anterior chamber area (ACA), anterior chamber volume (ACV), lens vault (LV), iris thickness 750 (IT750), intraocular pressure (IOP), and pupil diameter (PD) values were observed and compared before and after the treatment.A total of 12 articles were included in the meta-analysis. The results indicated that patients' ACD, I-Area, IOP, and PD values were lower after treatment than before treatment [mean deviation (MD): -0.32, 0.12, -0.04, 13.55, 0.30; 95% confidential interval (CI): -0.55 to -0.08, 0.04 to 0.1, -0.09 to 0.01, 4.71 to 22.39, 0.09 to 0.529; Z=2.66, 3.06, 1.39, 3, 2.75, and P=0.008, 0.002, 0.16, 0.003, 0.006, respectively]. The ACA, ACV, ARA, AOD750, and TISA500 values were higher after treatment than before treatment (MD: -3.22, -2.90, -0.03, -0.05, -0.01; 95% CI: -5.07 to -1.38, -5.44 to -0.36, -0.05 to -0.02, -0.08 to -0.03, -0.02 to -0.01; Z=3.42, 2.24, 4.10, 4.41, 7.77, and P=0.0006, 0.03, <0.0001, <0.0001, and <0.0001, respectively).

Hepatic steatosis assessment using ultrasound homodyned-K parametric imaging: the effects of estimators.,"The homodyned-K (HK) distribution is an important statistical model for describing ultrasound backscatter envelope statistics. HK parametric imaging has shown potential for characterizing hepatic steatosis. However, the feasibility of HK parametric imaging in assessing human hepatic steatosis <i>in vivo</i> remains unclear.In this paper, ultrasound HK <i>μ</i> parametric imaging was proposed for assessing human hepatic steatosis <i>in vivo</i>. Two recent estimators for the HK model, RSK (the level-curve method that uses the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), skewness, and kurtosis based on the fractional moments of the envelope) and XU (the estimation method based on the first moment of the intensity and two log-moments, namely <i>X</i>- and <i>U</i>-statistics), were investigated. Liver donors (n=72) and patients (n=204) were recruited to evaluate hepatic fat fractions (HFFs) using magnetic resonance spectroscopy and to evaluate the stages of fatty liver disease (normal, mild, moderate, and severe) using liver biopsy with histopathology. Livers were scanned using a 3-MHz ultrasound to construct <i>μ</i> <sub>RSK</sub> and <i>μ</i> <sub>XU</sub> images to correlate with HFF analyses and fatty liver stages. The <i>μ</i> <sub>RSK</sub> and <i>μ</i> <sub>XU</sub> parametric images were constructed using the sliding window technique with the window side length (WSL) =1-9 pulse lengths (PLs). The diagnostic values of the <i>μ</i> <sub>RSK</sub> and <i>μ</i> <sub>XU</sub> parametric imaging methods were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves.For the 72 participants in Group A, the <i>μ</i> <sub>RSK</sub> parametric imaging with WSL =2-9 PLs exhibited similar correlation with log<sub>10</sub>(HFF), and the <i>μ</i> <sub>RSK</sub> parametric imaging with WSL = 3 PLs had the highest correlation with log<sub>10</sub>(HFF) (r<i>=</i>0.592); the <i>μ</i> <sub>XU</sub> parametric imaging with WSL =1-9 PLs exhibited similar correlation with log<sub>10</sub>(HFF), and the <i>μ</i> <sub>XU</sub> parametric imaging with WSL =1 PL had the highest correlation with log<sub>10</sub>(HFF) (r=0.628). For the 204 patients in Group B, the areas under the ROC (AUROCs) obtained using <i>μ</i> <sub>RSK</sub> for fatty stages ≥ mild (AUROC<sub>1</sub>), ≥ moderate (AUROC<sub>2</sub>), and ≥ severe (AUROC<sub>3</sub>) were (AUROC<sub>1</sub>, AUROC<sub>2</sub>, AUROC<sub>3</sub>) = (0.56, 0.57, 0.53), (0.68, 0.72, 0.75), (0.73, 0.78, 0.80), (0.74, 0.77, 0.79), (0.74, 0.78, 0.79), (0.75, 0.80, 0.82), (0.74, 0.77, 0.83), (0.74, 0.78, 0.84) and (0.73, 0.76, 0.83) for WSL =1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 PLs, respectively. The AUROCs obtained using <i>μ</i> <sub>XU</sub> for fatty stages ≥ mild, ≥ moderate, and ≥ severe were (AUROC<sub>1</sub>, AUROC<sub>2</sub>, AUROC<sub>3</sub>) = (0.75, 0.83, 0.81), (0.74, 0.80, 0.80), (0.76, 0.82, 0.82), (0.74, 0.80, 0.84), (0.76, 0.80, 0.83), (0.75, 0.80, 0.84), (0.75, 0.79, 0.85), (0.75, 0.80, 0.85) and (0.73, 0.77, 0.83) for WSL = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 PLs, respectively.Both the <i>μ</i> <sub>RSK</sub> and <i>μ</i> <sub>XU</sub> parametric images are feasible for evaluating human hepatic steatosis. The WSL exhibits little impact on the diagnosing performance of the <i>μ</i> <sub>RSK</sub> and <i>μ</i> <sub>XU</sub> parametric imaging. The <i>μ</i> <sub>XU</sub> parametric imaging provided improved performance compared to the <i>μ</i> <sub>RSK</sub> parametric imaging in characterizing human hepatic steatosis <i>in vivo.</i>","['Hepatic steatosis', 'envelope statistics', 'homodynedK HK', 'quantitative ultrasound', 'ultrasound tissue characterization']"
Assessment of fragmented QRS formation and its relationship with left ventricular hypertrophy in nonhypertensive acromegaly patients.,"It is known that the presence of fragmented QRS (fQRS) on electrocardiography (ECG) is associated with cardiovascular events. The aim of this study was the evaluation of fQRS formation and its relationship with the left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) parameters in acromegaly patients.In total, 47 previously diagnosed with non-hypertensive acromegaly patients and 48 control subjects were included in the study. ECG and transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) were performed for each participant. Acromegaly patients were divided into two groups according to the fQRS formation on the ECG. Left ventricular wall thicknesses, and left atrial diameter (LAD), left ventricular mass (LVM), left ventricular mass index (LVMi), and relative wall thickness (RWT) were obtained.In control group 5 (10.4%) and in acromegaly group 17 (36.2%) patients had fQRS on ECG (p = 0.003). LAD [36.0 (34.0–38.0) vs. 38.0 (35.0–41.0) mm, p < 0.001], LVM [155.27 ± 27.00 vs. 173.0 (153.0–235.0) g, p < 0.001], LVMi [83.12 ± 13.19 vs. 92.0 (83.0–118.0) g/m², p < 0.001] and RWT [0.39 ± 0.03 vs. 0.43 (0.41–0.45), p = 0.001] were significantly higher in patients with acromegaly. Disease duration was significantly higher (11.59 ± 1.3 vs. 8.2 ± 1.8 years, p < 0.001) in the fQRS (+) group. LAD [41.0 (39.0–42.5) vs. 37.0 (34.7–38.0) mm, p < 0.001], LVM [219.0 (160.5–254.5) vs. 164.0 (153.0–188.0) g, p = 0.017], LVMi [117.0 (92.5–128.5) vs. 86.0 (82.0–100.2) g/m², p = 0.013] and RWT [0.44 (0.42–0.49) vs. 0.43 (0.40–0.44), p = 0.037] were significantly higher in fQSR (+) acromegaly patients. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, disease duration (odds ratio: 10.05, 95% CI: 1.099–92.012, p = 0.041) and LAD (odds ratio: 2.19, 95% CI: 1.030–4.660, p = 0.042) were found to be the independent predictors of fQRS formation.The results of our study revealed that fQRS (+) acromegaly patients had increased LVH parameters compared to fQRS (-) patients.","['Acromegaly', 'fragmented QRS', 'left ventricular hypertrophy', 'left ventricular mass']"
Association between risk factors and retinal nerve fiber layer loss in early stages of diabetic retinopathy.,"To investigate the changes of retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) among normal individuals, diabetic patients without diabetic retinopathy (NDR) and non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), and explore the possible risk factors of early diabetic retinopathy (DR).In this cross-sectional study, 107 participants were divided in three groups. Totally 31 normal individuals (control group), 40 diabetic patients without DR (NDR group) and 36 patients with NPDR (NPDR group) were included. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) was used to detect RNFL thickness and other optic disc parameters among different groups. The potential association between RNFL loss and systemic risk factors were assessed for DR, including diabetes duration, body mass index (BMI), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), serum lipids, and blood pressure.The average and each quadrant RNFL thickness were thinner in NPDR group compared to control group of the right (<i>P</i>=0.00, <i>P</i>=0.01, <i>P</i>=0.01, <i>P</i>=0.02, <i>P</i>=0.04) and left eyes (<i>P</i>=0.00, <i>P</i>=0.00, <i>P</i>=0.00, <i>P</i>=0.03, <i>P</i>=0.04). The average, superior and inferior RNFL thickness were thinner in NDR group compared to the NPDR group of the right (<i>P</i>=0.00, <i>P</i>=0.02, <i>P</i>=0.03) and left eyes (<i>P</i>=0.00, <i>P</i>=0.00, <i>P</i>=0.01). Diabetic duration was negatively correlated with the superior, inferior, and average RNFL thickness of the right (<i>r</i>=-0.385, <i>P</i>=0.001; <i>r</i>=-0.366, <i>P</i>=0.001; <i>r</i>=-0.503, <i>P</i>=0.000) and left eyes (<i>r</i>=-0.271, <i>P</i>=0.018; <i>r</i>=0.278, <i>P</i>=0.015; <i>r</i>=-0.260, <i>P</i>=0.023). HbA1c was negatively correlated with the superior, inferior, and average RNFL thickness of the right (<i>r</i>=-0.316 <i>P</i>=0.005; <i>r</i>=-0.414, <i>P</i>=0.000; <i>r</i>=-0.418, <i>P</i>=0.000) and left eyes (<i>r</i>=-0.367, <i>P</i>=0.001; <i>r</i>=-0.250, <i>P</i>=0.030; <i>r</i>=-0.393, <i>P</i>=0.000). Systolic pressure was negatively correlated with the inferior and average RNFL thickness of the right eye (<i>r</i>=-0.402, <i>P</i>=0.000; <i>r</i>=-0.371, <i>P</i>=0.001) and was negatively correlated with the superior and average RNFL thickness of the left eye (<i>r</i>=-0.264, <i>P</i>=0.021; <i>r</i>=-0.233, <i>P</i>=0.043).RNFL loss, especially in the superior and inferior quadrants, may be the earliest structural change of the retina in diabetic patients, and is also associated with diabetic duration, HbA1c, and systolic pressure.","['RNFL less', 'diabetic retinopathy', 'neurodegeneration', 'optical coherence tomography', 'risk factors']"
A cascade eye diseases screening system with interpretability and expandability in ultra-wide field fundus images: A multicentre diagnostic accuracy study.,"Clinical application of artificial intelligence is limited due to the lack of interpretability and expandability in complex clinical settings. We aimed to develop an eye diseases screening system with improved interpretability and expandability based on a lesion-level dissection and tested the clinical expandability and auxiliary ability of the system.The four-hierarchical interpretable eye diseases screening system (IEDSS) based on a novel structural pattern named lesion atlas was developed to identify 30 eye diseases and conditions using a total of 32,026 ultra-wide field images collected from the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University, School of Medicine (SAHZU), the First Affiliated Hospital of University of Science and Technology of China (FAHUSTC), and the Affiliated People's Hospital of Ningbo University (APHNU) in China between November 1, 2016 to February 28, 2022. The performance of IEDSS was compared with ophthalmologists and classic models trained with image-level labels. We further evaluated IEDSS in two external datasets, and tested it in a real-world scenario and an extended dataset with new phenotypes beyond the training categories. The accuracy (ACC), F1 score and confusion matrix were calculated to assess the performance of IEDSS.IEDSS reached average ACCs (aACC) of 0·9781 (95%CI 0·9739-0·9824), 0·9660 (95%CI 0·9591-0·9730) and 0·9709 (95%CI 0·9655-0·9763), frequency-weighted average F1 scores of 0·9042 (95%CI 0·8957-0·9127), 0·8837 (95%CI 0·8714-0·8960) and 0·8874 (95%CI 0·8772-0·8972) in datasets of SAHZU, APHNU and FAHUSTC, respectively. IEDSS reached a higher aACC (0·9781, 95%CI 0·9739-0·9824) compared with a multi-class image-level model (0·9398, 95%CI 0·9329-0·9467), a classic multi-label image-level model (0·9278, 95%CI 0·9189-0·9366), a novel multi-label image-level model (0·9241, 95%CI 0·9151-0·9331) and a lesion-level model without Adaboost (0·9381, 95%CI 0·9299-0·9463). In the real-world scenario, the aACC of IEDSS (0·9872, 95%CI 0·9828-0·9915) was higher than that of the senior ophthalmologist (SO) (0·9413, 95%CI 0·9321-0·9504, p = 0·000) and the junior ophthalmologist (JO) (0·8846, 95%CI 0·8722-0·8971, p = 0·000). IEDSS remained strong performance (ACC = 0·8560, 95%CI 0·8252-0·8868) compared with JO (ACC = 0·784, 95%CI 0·7479-0·8201, p= 0·003) and SO (ACC = 0·8500, 95%CI 0·8187-0·8813, <i>p</i> = 0·789) in the extended dataset.IEDSS showed excellent and stable performance in identifying common eye conditions and conditions beyond the training categories. The transparency and expandability of IEDSS could tremendously increase the clinical application range and the practical clinical value of it. It would enhance the efficiency and reliability of clinical practice, especially in remote areas with a lack of experienced specialists.National Natural Science Foundation Regional Innovation and Development Joint Fund (U20A20386), Key research and development program of Zhejiang Province (2019C03020), Clinical Medical Research Centre for Eye Diseases of Zhejiang Province (2021E50007).","['Artificial intelligence', 'Enpandability', 'Eye diseases screening system', 'Interpretability', 'Ultrawide field fundus image']"
Effects of immersion in a simulated natural environment on stress reduction and emotional arousal: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Although the mental health benefits of exposure to simulated natural environments are well established by researchers from environmental psychology, landscape architecture, and public health, it is unclear whether and to what extent technological immersion affects these benefits.Systematical literature searches were conducted in May 2022 from six databases. The risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool 2.0 and the Risk of Bias in Non-randomized Studies of Interventions tool. We performed a random-effects meta-regression to investigate the heterogeneity. The immersion levels of included studies were classified by projection devices and motion capture, and then subgroup analysis was conducted.Twenty-six publications were included. Exposure to simulated nature was confirmed to be associated with increased positive affect 0.40 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.22, 0.58], vigor 0.58 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.86), calmness 0.54 (95% CI: 0.17, 0.92) and decreased perceived stress -0.38 (95% CI: -0.71, -0.06), total mood disturbance -0.87 (95% CI: -1.17, -0.57), tension -0.70 (95% CI: -0.99, -0.41), fatigue -0.60 (95% CI: -0.91, -0.28), anxiety -0.72 (95% CI: -1.43, -0.02), depression -0.33 (95% CI: -0.52, -0.14), confusion -0.79 (95% CI: -1.19, -0.40), and anger -0.54 (95% CI: -0.76, -0.31). Gender, health status, study design, mean age, and single exposure duration were not significant when entered in a meta-regression. For positive affect, medium immersion was observed to produce a larger effect than low and high immersion. All included studies had a moderate to high risk of bias.Audio-visual exposure to simulated nature contributes to stress relief and emotional arousal. The immersion level explains the heterogeneity of positive affect triggered by simulated nature. Focusing on the technical features will open up new possibilities for combining actual and simulated nature's mental health benefits.","['emotion', 'immersion', 'natural environment', 'restorative effect', 'stress', 'virtual reality']"
Genetic evaluation for production and body size traits using different animal models in purebred-Duroc pigs.,"Duroc pigs are popular crossbred terminal sires, and accurate assessment of genetic parameters in the population can help to rationalize breeding programmes. The principle aim of this study were to evaluate the genetic parameters of production (birth weight, BW; age at 115 kg, AGE; feed conversion ratio, FCR) and body size (body length, BL; body height, BH; front cannon circumference, FCC) traits of Duroc pigs. The second objective was to analyze the fit of different genetic assessment models. The variance components and correlations of BW (28,348 records), AGE (28,335 records), FCR (11,135 records), BL (31,544 records), BH (21,862 records), and FCC (14,684 records) traits were calculated by using DMU and AIREMLF90 from BLUPF90 package. In the common environment model, the heritability of BW, AGE, FCR, BL, BH, and FCC traits were 0.17 ± 0.014, 0.30 ± 0.019, 0.28 ± 0.024, 0.16 ± 0.013, 0.14 ± 0.017, and 0.081 ± 0.016, with common litter effect values of 0.25, 0.20, 0.18, 0.23, 0.19, and 0.16, respectively. According to the results of the Akaike information criterion (AIC) calculations, models with smaller AIC values have a better fit. We found that the common environment model with litter effects as random effects for estimating genetic parameters had a better fit. In this Model, the estimated genetic correlations between AGE with BW, FCR, BL, BH, and FCC traits were -0.28 (0.040), 0.76 (0.038), -0.71 (0.036), -0.44 (0.060), and -0.60 (0.073), respectively, with phenotypic correlations of -0.17, 0.52, -0.22, -0.13 and -0.24, respectively. In our analysis of genetic trends for six traits in the Duroc population from 2012 to 2021, we observed significant genetic trends for AGE, BL, and BH. Particularly noteworthy is the rapid decline in the genetic trend for AGE, indicating an enhancement in the pig's growth rate through selective breeding. Therefore, we believe that some challenging-to-select traits can benefit from the genetic correlations between traits. By selecting easily measurable traits, they can gain from synergistic selection effects, leading to genetic progress. Conducting population genetic parameter analysis can assist us in devising breeding strategies.","['Duroc pigs', 'animal model', 'body size traits', 'common litter effect', 'genetic parameters', 'production traits']"
Adolescent media use and its association to wellbeing in a Canadian national sample.,"Our objective is to describe associations between media usage and multiple wellbeing indicators in a nationally representative sample of Canadian youth (CSTADS 2012-13) enrolled in grades 7 to 12 (N = 41,057). Youth reported media usage (television/movie viewing, videogame playing, and surfing the internet), wellbeing (academic achievement, school connectedness, self-esteem, physical activity, intake of fruits and vegetables, and bullying), and psychological (drug use, drinking, and smoking) and sociodemographic confounds (ethnicity, grade, province, gender). Videogame playing was negatively associated with academic achievement, b = -0.07 (99% CI, -0.08-05), physical activity, b = -3.09, (99% CI, -3.63-2.56), school connectedness, b = -0.03 (99% CI, -0.04-0.02), self-esteem, b = -0.13 (99% CI, -0.16-0.09), and the consumption of fruits and vegetables b = -0.07 (99% CI, -0.11-0.03). Internet usage was negatively related to self-esteem, b = -0.25 (99% CI, -0.28-0.21), school connectedness, b = -0.03 (99% CI, -0.03-0.02), academic achievement, b = -0.02 (99% CI, -0.03-0.002) and physical activity b = -1.42 (99% CI, -1.92-0.91). Finally, television exposure was linked with less fruits and vegetable consumption, b = -0.09 (99% CI, -0.12-0.06), academic achievement b = -0.05 (99% CI, -0.07-0.04), school connectedness b = -0.02 (99% CI, -0.03-0.01), self-esteem b = -0.06 (99% CI, -0.11-0.003), and physical activity b = -1.09 (99% CI, -1.64-0.54). Internet, television/movies, and videogame time also increased the odds of bullying others by 9%, OR = 1.09 (99% CI, 1.04-1.14) 8%, OR = 1.08 (99% CI, 1.01-1.16) and 7%, OR = 1.07 (99% CI, 1.01-1.14) respectively.

A novel non-invasive method for predicting bone mineral density and fracture risk using demographic and anthropometric measures.,"Fractures are costly to treat and can significantly increase morbidity. Although dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is used to screen at risk people with low bone mineral density (BMD), not all areas have access to one. We sought to create a readily accessible, inexpensive, high-throughput prediction tool for BMD that may identify people at risk of fracture for further evaluation. Anthropometric and demographic data were collected from 492 volunteers (♂275, ♀217; [44 ​± ​20] years; Body Mass Index (BMI) = [27.6 ​± ​6.0] kg/m<sup>2</sup>) in addition to total body bone mineral content (BMC, kg) and BMD measurements of the spine, pelvis, arms, legs and total body. Multiple-linear-regression with step-wise removal was used to develop a two-step prediction model for BMC followed by BMC. Model selection was determined by the highest adjusted <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>, lowest error of estimate, and lowest level of variance inflation (<i>α</i> ​= ​0.05). Height (HTcm), age (years), sex<sup>m=1, f=0</sup>, %body fat (%fat), fat free mass (FFMkg), fat mass (FMkg), leg length (LLcm), shoulder width (SHWDTHcm), trunk length (TRNKLcm), and pelvis width (PWDTHcm) were observed to be significant predictors in the following two-step model (<i>p</i> ​< ​0.05).

Mesopic visual quality after accelerated corneal cross linking: A 12-month follow-up study.,"To determine the 1-year changes of mesopic higher order aberrations (HOAs) and contrast sensitivity (CS) after accelerated corneal cross linking (CXL) in progressive keratoconus.In this prospective case series, 70 eyes of 62 keratoconic patients underwent accelerated CXL (18 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, 5 min). HOAs and CS were measured using the OPD Scan III and CSV-1000 CS test charts under mesopic conditions before and 6 and 12 months after CXL.At 1 year, logarithmic mesopic CS in spatial frequencies of 3, 6, 12, and 18 cycles per degree (CPD) had increased by 0.05 ± 0.29 (<i>P</i> = 0.029), 0.04 ± 0.88 (<i>P</i> = 0.012), 0.27 ± 0.46 (<i>P</i> = 0.172), and 0.06 ± 0.22 (<i>P</i> = 0.020), respectively.

The correlations between mesopic CS and HOAs were weak before and after CXL.One year after accelerated CXL, CS significantly improved, but changes in HOAs were statistically insignificant. CS changes were independent of HOAs.","['Accelerated cross linking', 'Mesopic contrast sensitivity', 'Mesopic higher order aberrations', 'OPD Scan III']"
Impact of an injury hospital admission on childhood academic performance: a Welsh population-based data linkage study.,"While injuries can impact on children's educational achievements (with threats to their development and employment prospects), these risks are poorly quantified. This population-based longitudinal study investigated the impact of an injury-related hospital admission on Welsh children's academic performance.The Secure Anonymised Information Linkage databank, 55 587 children residing in Wales from 2006 to 2016 who had an injury hospital admission (58.2% males; 16.8% born in most deprived Wales area; 80.1% one injury hospital admission) were linked to data from the Wales Electronic Cohort for Children. The primary outcome was the Core Subject Indicator reflecting educational achievement at key stages 2 (school years 3-6), 3 (school years 7-9) and 4 (school years 10-11). Covariates in models included demographic, birth, injury and school characteristics.Educational achievement of children was negatively associated with: pedestrian injuries (adjusted risk ratio, (95% CIs)) (0.87, (0.83 to 0.92)), cyclist (0.96, (0.94 to 0.99)), high fall (0.96, (0.94 to 0.97)), fire/flames/smoke (0.85, (0.73 to 0.99)), cutting/piercing object (0.96, (0.93 to 0.99)), intentional self-harm (0.86, (0.82 to 0.91)), minor traumatic brain injury (0.92, (0.86 to 0.99)), contusion/open wound (0.93, (0.91 to 0.95)), fracture of vertebral column (0.78, (0.64 to 0.95)), fracture of femur (0.88, (0.84 to 0.93)), internal abdomen/pelvic haemorrhage (0.82, (0.69 to 0.97)), superficial injury (0.94, (0.92 to 0.97)), young maternal age (<18 years: 0.91, (0.88 to 0.94); 19-24 years: 0.94, (0.93 to 0.96)); area based socioeconomic status (0.98, (0.97 to 0.98)); moving to a more deprived area (0.95, (0.93 to 0.97)); requiring special educational needs (0.46, (0.44 to 0.47)). Positive associations were: being female (1.04, (1.03 to 1.06)); larger pupil school sizes and maternal age 30+ years.This study highlights the importance on a child's education of preventing injuries and implementing intervention programmes that support injured children. Greater attention is needed on equity-focused educational support and social policies addressing needs of children at risk of underachievement, including those from families experiencing poverty.

Older adult preferences regarding benefits and harms of statin and aspirin therapy for cardiovascular primary prevention.,"Personalizing preventive therapies for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) is particularly important for older adults, as they tend to have multiple chronic conditions, increased risk for medication adverse effects, and may have heterogenous preferences when weighing health outcomes. However, little is known about outcome preferences related to ASCVD preventive therapies in older adults.In May 2021, using an established online panel, KnowledgePanel, we surveyed older US adults aged 65-84 years without history of ASCVD on outcome preferences related to statin therapy (benefit outcomes to be reduced by the therapy: heart attack, stroke; adverse effects: diabetes, abnormal liver test, muscle pain) or aspirin therapy (benefit outcomes: heart attack, stroke; adverse effects: brain bleed, bowel bleed, stomach ulcer). We used standardized best-worst scores (range of -1 for ""least worrisome"" to +1 for ""most worrisome"") and conditional logistic regression to examine the relative importance of the outcomes.In this study, 607 ASCVD-free participants (median age 74, 46% male, 81% White) were included; 304 and 303 completed the statin and aspirin versions of the survey, respectively. For statin-related outcomes, stroke and heart attack were most worrisome (score 0.55; 95% CI 0.51, 0.60) and (0.53; 0.48, 0.58), followed by potential harms of diabetes (-0.07; -0.10, -0.03), abnormal liver test (-0.25; -0.29, -0.20), and muscle pain (-0.77; -0.82, -0.73). For aspirin-related outcomes, stroke and heart attack were similarly most worrisome (0.48; 0.43, 0.52) and (0.43; 0.38, 0.48), followed by brain bleed (0.30; 0.25, 0.34), bowel bleed (-0.31; -0.33, -0.28), and stomach ulcer (-0.90; -0.92, -0.87). Conditional logistic regression and subgroup analyses by age, sex, and race yielded similar results.Older adults generally consider outcomes related to benefits of ASCVD primary preventive therapies-stroke and heart attack-more important than their adverse effects. Integrating patient preferences with risk assessment is an important next step for personalizing ASCVD preventive therapies for older adults.","['Aspirin', 'Cardiovascular primary prevention', 'Older adult preferences', 'Statin']"
A combination of the Modified Early Warning Score and the Korean Triage and Acuity Scale as a triage tool in patients with infection.,"We evaluated the utility of the Korean Modified Early Warning Score (KMEWS), which combines the Modified Early Warning Score (MEWS) and the Korean Triage and Acuity Scale (KTAS), as a triage tool to screen for infection in patients who visit the emergency department.We retrospectively reviewed data extracted from electronic medical records. Patients aged ≥18 years with an infection who were admitted to the hospital via the emergency department between January 2018 and December 2019 were eligible for inclusion. The KMEWS score was calculated as the sum of the KTAS level and the MEWS score. We generated receiver operating characteristic curves and determined the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the KMEWS, KTAS, MEWS, and Mortality in Emergency Department Sepsis (MEDS) scales. The primary outcome was septic shock, and secondary outcomes were intensive care unit admission and in-hospital mortality.The AUC values (95% confidence interval) for predicting septic shock were as follows: KMEWS, 0.910 (0.902-0.918); MEWS, 0.896 (0.887-0.904); KTAS score, 0.809 (0.798-0.819); and MEDS, 0.927 (0.919-0.934). The AUC values (95% confidence interval) for predicting in-hospital mortality were as follows: KMEWS, 0.752 (0.740-0.764); MEWS, 0.717 (0.704-0.729); KTAS score, 0.764 (0.752-0.776); and MEDS, 0.844 (0.834-0.854). The AUC values (95% confidence interval) for predicting intensive care unit admission were as follows: KMEWS, 0.826 (0.816-0.837); MEWS, 0.782 (0.770-0.793); KTAS score, 0.821 (0.810-0.831); and MEDS, 0.839 (0.829-0.849).The KMEWS, which is a combination of the MEWS and the KTAS scores, might be a useful triage tool in emergency department patients who present with infection, particularly for predicting septic shock.","['Critical care', 'Hospital emergency service', 'Mortality', 'Septic shock', 'Triage']"
Comparative Effectiveness of Interventions for Stroke Prevention in Atrial Fibrillation: A Network Meta-Analysis.,"The goal of this study was to compare the safety and effectiveness of individual antiembolic interventions in nonvalvular atrial fibrillation (AF): novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) (apixaban, dabigatran, edoxaban, and rivaroxaban); vitamin K antagonists (VKA); aspirin; and the Watchman device.A network meta-analysis of randomized, clinical trials (RCTs) was performed. RCTs that included patients with prosthetic cardiac valves or mitral stenosis, mean or median follow-up <6 months, <200 participants, without published report in English language, and NOAC phase II studies were excluded. The placebo/control arm received either placebo or no treatment. The primary efficacy outcome was the combination of stroke (of any type) and systemic embolism. All-cause mortality served as a secondary efficacy outcome. The primary safety outcome was the combination of major extracranial bleeding and intracranial hemorrhage. A total of 21 RCTs (96 017 nonvalvular AF patients; median age, 72 years; 65% males; median follow-up, 1.7 years) were included. In comparison to placebo/control, use of aspirin (odds ratio [OR], 0.75 [95% CI, 0.60-0.95]), VKA (0.38 [0.29-0.49]), apixaban (0.31 [0.22-0.45]), dabigatran (0.29 [0.20-0.43]), edoxaban (0.38 [0.26-0.54]), rivaroxaban (0.27 [0.18-0.42]), and the Watchman device (0.36 [0.16-0.80]) significantly reduced the risk of any stroke or systemic embolism in nonvalvular AF patients, as well as all-cause mortality (aspirin: OR, 0.82 [0.68-0.99]; VKA: 0.69 [0.57-0.85]; apixaban: 0.62 [0.50-0.78]; dabigatran: 0.62 [0.50-0.78]; edoxaban: 0.62 [0.50-0.77]; rivaroxaban: 0.58 [0.44-0.77]; and the Watchman device: 0.47 [0.25-0.88]). Apixaban (0.89 [0.80-0.99]), dabigatran (0.90 [0.82-0.99]), and edoxaban (0.89 [0.82-0.96]) reduced risk of all-cause death as compared to VKA.The entire spectrum of therapy to prevent thromboembolism in nonvalvular AF significantly reduced stroke/systemic embolism events and mortality.","['anticoagulation', 'atrial fibrillation', 'comparative effectiveness', 'left atrial appendage', 'nonvalvular', 'oral anticoagulants', 'stroke', 'vitamin K antagonists', 'watchman']"
Comparison of four markers of hepatic fibrosis and hepatic function indices in patients with liver cirrhosis and hepatoma.,"The present study aimed to compare four hepatic fibrosis markers [i.e., hyaluronic acid (HA), laminin (LN), procollagen III N-terminal peptide (PIIINP), and collagen type IV (CIV)] and 16 hepatic function indices in patients with liver cirrhosis of varying etiology.The hepatic function indices and hepatic fibrosis markers were measured in 108 patients with liver cirrhosis and hepatoma using an automatic biochemical analyzer and luminescent immune analyzer. Twenty healthy controls were enrolled to compare the differences between liver cirrhosis and hepatoma of varying etiology and to analyze the correlations between the hepatic function indices and fibrosis markers.There was no correlation between alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total protein (TP), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), or the four markers of hepatic fibrosis in liver cirrhosis caused by hepatitis B (P>0.05). Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) was positively correlated with HA (r=0.428, P=0.007), LN (r=0.458, P=0.004), and CIV (r=0.374, P=0.021). Total bilirubin (TBIL) and direct bilirubin (DBIL) were positively correlated with LN (TBIL: r=0.480, P=0.002; DBIL: r=0.457, P=0.004), PIIINP (TBIL: r=0.380, P=0.017; DBIL: r=0.406, P=0.011), and CIV (TBIL: r=0.415, P=0.010; DBIL: r=0.400, P=0.013). Total bile acid (TBA) and γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) were positively correlated with PIIINP (TBA: r=0.363, P=0.025; GGT: r=0.353, P=0.029) and CIV (TBA: r=0.419, P=0.009; GGT: r=0.335, P=0.040). Leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) was positively correlated with LN (r=0.482, P=0.002). Cholinesterase (CHE) (HA: r=-0.452, P=0.004, LN: r=-0.336, P=0.039; PIIINP: r=-0.468, P=0.003; CIV: r=-0.485, P=0.002), prealbumin (PA) (HA: r=-0.575, P=0.000, LN: r=-0.413, P=0.010; PIIINP: r=-0.344, P=0.035; CIV: r=-0.371, P=0.022), albumin (ALB) (HA: r=-0.541, P=0.000, LN: r=-0.373, P=0.021; PIIINP: r=-0.353, P=0.030; CIV: r=-0.415, P=0.010), and superoxide dismutase (SOD) (HA: r=-0.334, P=0.040, LN: r=-0.347, P=0.033; PIIINP: r=-0.487, P=0.002; CIV: r=-0.536, P=0.001) were negatively correlated with the four markers of hepatic fibrosis. There was no correlation between ALT, AST, TBIL, TP, ALP, GGT, or the four hepatic fibrosis markers in hepatoma caused by hepatitis B (P>0.05). Meanwhile, DBIL and TBA were positively correlated with CIV (DBIL: r=0.519, P=0.023; TBA: r=0.563, P=0.012), while CHE (r=-0.604, P=0.006), ALB (r=-0.564, P=0.012), and SOD (r=-0.489, P=0.034) were negatively correlated with CIV. Moreover, PA was negatively correlated with LN (r=-0.510, P=0.026) and CIV (r=-0.696, P=0.001).The concentrations of the serological indices differed significantly based on the specific liver cirrhosis etiology. There was a strong correlation between the hepatic function indices and four hepatic fibrosis markers. Thus, the detection of these markers might improve the diagnosis and treatment of hepatoma.","['Fibrosis4 index', 'cirrhosis', 'collagen type IV', 'hepatic cancer', 'hyaluronic acid', 'laminin', 'procollagen III Nterminal peptide']"
Serum Level of Total Lipids and Telomere Length in the Male Population: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Telomeres contain TTAGGG (T; Thymine, A; Adenine and G; Guanine) repetitive sequences and are placed at the end of human chromosomes. Telomere dysfunction is implicated in some age-related and chronic diseases, but its association with total serum lipids and obesity is unknown. Our objective was to determine influenced of total serum lipids on leukocyte telomere lengths (TLs). Participants were selected by cluster sampling from 22 districts of Tehran. The questionnaires were completed by 500 subjects and after the initial assessment in terms of lifestyle, nutrition, home, and job, 300 healthy people, aged 25-40 years were finally selected. TLs and serum level of total lipids were measured by quantitative real-time PCR and the Phillips method, respectively. The average telomere length (T/S) and total lipids were 1.05 ± 0.3 mg/dl and 643.3 ± 70.8 mg/dl, respectively. We found that a one unit difference in the following parameters were associated with kilo base pair differences in TL: Age -0.0002 (95% CI [-0.0022, -0.0018]), BMI -0.0019 (95% CI [-0.0003, -0.0034]), TC 0.0001 (95% CI [-0.0006, -0.0007]), TG -0.0010 (95% CI [-0.0015, -0.0004]), PL 0.0001 (95% CI [-0.0005, -0.0007]), and TSL -0.0003 (95% CI [-0.0008, 0.0001]). Spearman correlation analysis revealed an inverse relationship between TC (R = -0.53; 95% CI [-0.61, -0.44]), TG (R = -0.50; 95% CI [-0.58, -0.41]), PL (R = -0.46; 95% CI [-0.54-0.36]), and TSL (R = -0.63; 95% CI [-0.69, -0.56]) with T/S. Our research suggests that the inverse relationship was found between TL and weight, BMI, age, and TSL which were associated with obesity. High serum lipids concentration may be associated with systemic inflammation and atherosclerosis and may lead to oxidative stress, resulting in telomere shortening.","['peripheral blood leukocytes', 'serum lipids concentrations', 'telomere length']"
Characteristics associated with attitudes and behaviors towards mask wearing during the COVID-19 pandemic: The Trojan Pandemic Response Initiative.,"Attitudes and behaviors towards mask wearing may influence the ability to reduce transmission of COVID-19 and other diseases.University students, staff, and faculty (N = 9653) responded to an email invitation to complete electronic surveys (November 2021 and April 2022). Surveys included 19 items measuring attitudes and behaviors towards mask wearing from the Understanding America Study. Linear mixed models including variables for sex, age group, division, race and ethnicity, political affiliation, and history of COVID-19, were used to estimate the mean difference of the mean score for attitudes and behavior between Time 1 (November 2021) and Time 2 (April 2022).Participants were mostly female (62.1%), students (70.6%), White (39.5%) and Asian (34.7%). More than half identified their political affiliation as Democrat (65.5%). Characteristic variable-by-time interactions for difference in mean mask attitude scores difference were significant at Time 1 (T1) and Time 2 (T2) between Black and White participants (B = 0.18 (0.05), 95% CI: 0.07, 0.28, p = 0.001), Asian and White participants (B = 0.07 (0.02), 95% CI: 0.03-0.12, p = 0.001), participants with self-reported history of COVID-19 and no history of COVID-19 (B= -0.13 (0.02), 95% CI: -0.07, -0.18, p < 0.0001), females and males (B = 0.07 (0.02), 95% CI: 0.03, 0.11, p = 0.001), Republicans and Democrats (B= -0.18 (0.04), 95%CI: -0.26, -0.10, p < 0.0001) and Independents and Democrats (B= -0.10 (0.03), 95%CI: -0.15, -0.05, p < 0.0001). Mean difference in mean scores for mask behaviors at Time and Time 2 were significant between participants with COVID-19 and participants who did not have COVID-19 (B= -0.12 (0.04), 95% CI: -0.19, -0.04, p = 0.004), students compared to faculty and staff (B=-0.22 (0.05), -0.32, -0.12, p < 0.0001), between Republicans and Democrats (B-= -0.16 (0.07), 95% CI: -0.28, -0.03, p = 0.020, and between Independents and Democrats (B=-0.08 (0.04), 95% CI: -0.16, -0.002, p = 0.04).Race and ethnicity, political affiliation, and division may affect attitudes and behaviors in mask wearing. Further investigation into how characteristics influence public health measures such as mask wearing is needed to contain the spread of the COVID-19 virus, other infectious diseases, and future pandemics.","['COVID19', 'Face mask', 'Health behavior', 'SARSCOV2', 'University sample']"
Efficacy and safety of conventional antiviral agents in preventive strategies for cytomegalovirus infection after kidney transplantation: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is common in kidney transplantation (KT). Antiviral-agents are used as universal prophylaxis. Our purpose aimed to compare and rank efficacy and safety. MEDLINE, Embase, SCOPUS, and CENTRAL were used from inception to September 2020 regardless language restriction. We included randomized clinical trials (RCTs) comparing the CMV infection/disease prophylaxis among antiviral-agents in adult KT recipients. Of 24 eligible RCTs, prophylactic valganciclovir (VGC) could significantly lower the overall CMV infection and disease risks than placebo with pooled risk differences (RDs) [95% confidence interval (CI)] of -0.36 (-0.54, -0.18) and -0.28 (-0.48, -0.08), respectively. Valacyclovir (VAC) and ganciclovir (GC) significantly decreased risks with the corresponding RDs of -0.25 (-0.32, -0.19) and -0.30 (-0.37, -0.22) for CMV infection and -0.26 (-0.40, -0.12) and -0.22 (-0.31, -0.12) for CMV disease. For subgroup analysis by seropositive-donor and seronegative-recipient (D+/R-), VGC and GC significantly lowered the risk of CMV infection/disease with RDs of -0.42 (-0.84, -0.01) and -0.35 (-0.60, -0.12). For pre-emptive strategies, GC lowered the incidence of CMV disease significantly with pooled RDs of -0.33 (-0.47, -0.19). VGC may be the best in prophylaxis of CMV infection/disease follow by GC. VAC might be an alternative where VGC and GC are not available.","['cytomegalovirus', 'kidney transplant', 'universalprophylaxis']"
Altered profiles of fecal metabolites correlate with visceral hypersensitivity and may contribute to symptom severity of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.,"Fecal metabolites are associated with gut visceral sensitivity, mucosal immune function and intestinal barrier function, all of which have critical roles in the pathogenesis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). However, the metabolic profile and pathophysiology of IBS are still unclear. We hypothesized that altered profiles of fecal metabolites might be involved in the pathogenesis of IBS with predominant diarrhea (IBS-D).To investigate the fecal metabolite composition and the role of metabolites in IBS-D pathophysiology.Thirty IBS-D patients and 15 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) underwent clinical and psychological assessments, including the IBS Symptom Severity System (IBS-SSS), an Italian modified version of the Bowel Disease Questionnaire, the Bristol Stool Form Scale (BSFS), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and the Visceral Sensitivity Index. Visceral sensitivity to rectal distension was tested using high-resolution manometry system by the same investigator. Fecal metabolites, including amino acids and organic acids, were measured by targeted metabolomics approaches. Correlation analyses between these parameters were performed.The patients presented with increased stool water content, more psychological symptoms and increased visceral hypersensitivity compared with the controls. In fecal metabolites, His [IBS-D: 0.0642 (0.0388, 0.1484), HC: 0.2636 (0.0780, 0.3966), <i>P</i> = 0.012], Ala [IBS-D: 0.5095 (0.2826, 0.9183), HC: 1.0118 (0.6135, 1.4335), <i>P</i> = 0.041], Tyr [IBS-D: 0.1024 (0.0173, 0.4527), HC: 0.5665 (0.2436, 1.3447), <i>P</i> = 0.018], Phe [IBS-D: 0.1511 (0.0775, 0.3248), HC: 0.3967 (0.1388, 0.7550), <i>P</i> = 0.028], and Trp [IBS-D: 0.0323 (0.0001, 0.0826), HC: 0.0834 (0.0170, 0.1759), <i>P</i> = 0.046] were decreased in IBS-D patients, but isohexanoate [IBS-D: 0.0127 (0.0060, 0.0246), HC: 0.0070 (0.0023, 0.0106), <i>P</i> = 0.028] was significantly increased. Only Tyr was mildly correlated with BSFS scores in all subjects (<i>r</i> = -0.347, <i>P</i> = 0.019). A possible potential biomarker panel was identified to correlate with IBS-SSS score (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> <sub>Adjusted</sub> = 0.693, <i>P</i> < 0.001). In this regression model, the levels of Tyr, Val, hexanoate, fumarate, and pyruvate were significantly associated with the symptom severity of IBS-D. Furthermore, visceral sensation, including abdominal pain and visceral hypersensitivity, was correlated with isovalerate, valerate and isohexanoate.Altered profiles of fecal metabolites may be one of the origins or exacerbating factors of symptoms in IBS-D <i>via</i> increasing visceral sensitivity.","['Amino acids', 'Fecal metabolite', 'Irritable bowel syndrome', 'Organic acids', 'Short chain fatty acids', 'Visceral hypersensitivity']"
Effect of Quercetin on Lipids Metabolism Through Modulating the Gut Microbial and AMPK/PPAR Signaling Pathway in Broilers.,"The present study was conducted to investigate effects and mechanism of quercetin on lipids metabolism in broilers. 480 AA broilers were randomly allotted to four treatments (0, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 g/kg quercetin) for 42 days. Compared with the control, 0.6 g/kg quercetin significantly decreased percentage of abdominal fat (<i>P</i> < 0.05); 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 g/kg quercetin significantly decreased relative abundance of <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> and <i>Desulfovibrionaceae</i> (<i>P</i> < 0.05, <i>P</i> < 0.05, <i>P</i> < 0.01; <i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.01); 0.2 g/kg quercetin significantly increased mRNA expression of PI3K, AMPKα1, AMPKα2, AMPKβ2, LKB1 (<i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.05, <i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.05), and significantly reduced mRNA expression of SREBP1 and PPARγ (<i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.05); 0.4 g/kg quercetin significantly increased mRNA expression of LKB1 and PKB (<i>P</i> < 0.05, <i>P</i> < 0.01) and significantly reduced mRNA expression of ACC, HMGR, PPARγ, and SREBP1 (<i>P</i> < 0.05, <i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.01); 0.6 g/kg quercetin significantly increased mRNA expression of AMPKγ, LKB1, CPT1, PPARα, PKB (<i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.05, <i>P</i> < 0.05), and significantly reduced the mRNA expression of PI3K, ACC, HMGR, PPARγ, SREBP1 (<i>P</i> < 0.05, <i>P</i> < 0.05, <i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.01); 0.2 g/kg quercetin significantly increased protein expression of AMPK (<i>P</i> < 0.01); 0.6 g/kg quercetin significantly increased protein expression of LKB1 (<i>P</i> < 0.01), 0.2 and 0.6 g/kg quercetin significantly increased protein expression of PI3K, PKB, CPT1 (<i>P</i> < 0.05, <i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.05, <i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.01), and significantly reduced protein expression of ACC and SREBP1 (<i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.01). In conclusion, quercetin improved lipid metabolism by modulating gut microbial and AMPK/PPAR signaling pathway in broilers.","['AMPK', 'PPAR', 'lipids metabolism', 'microbial', 'quercetin']"
Optical Coherence Tomography Reveals Longitudinal Changes in Retinal Damage Under Different Treatments for Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum Disorder.,"<b>Background:</b> Progressive retinal neuroaxonal damage after acute optic neuritis may occur in neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). However, it is unclear if treatments used to prevent attacks influence neurodegeneration. <b>Objectives:</b> We aimed to investigate retinal damage in patients treated with disease-modifying drugs in a longitudinal study. <b>Methods:</b> We retrospectively included 50 patients with aquaporin 4-antibody-seropositive NMOSD. Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness, macular ganglion cell complex (mGCC) thickness, total macular volume (TMV), and optic disc measures were acquired by spectral domain optical coherence tomography in patients treated with tocilizumab, rituximab, and azathioprine. <b>Results:</b> Longitudinally, in eyes with a history of ON (NMOSD<sup>ON+</sup>), we observed annual thinning of mGCC [tocilizumab: -1.77 (-3.44, -0.09) μm, <i>p</i> = 0.041; rituximab: -2.03 (-3.58, -0.48) μm, <i>p</i> = 0.017; azathioprine: -1.79 (-2.22, -1.37) μm, <i>p</i> < 0.001], and pRNFL [tocilizumab: -2.07 (-0.75, -3.39) μm, <i>p</i> = 0.005; rituximab: -2.18 (-0.36, -4.00) μm, <i>p</i> = 0.023; azathioprine: -2.37 (-0.98, -3.75) μm, <i>p</i> = 0.003], reduced TMV [tocilizumab: -0.12 (-0.22, -0.01) mm<sup>3</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.028; rituximab: -0.15 (-0.21, -0.08) mm<sup>3</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.001; azathioprine: -0.12 (-0.20, -0.04) mm<sup>3</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.006], and increased cup area [tocilizumab: 0.08 (-0.01, 0.16) mm<sup>2</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.010; rituximab: 0.07 (0.01, 0.12) mm<sup>2</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.019; azathioprine: 0.14 (0.02, 0.26) mm<sup>2</sup>, <i>p</i> = 0.023]. However, we detected no significant differences in annual changes in mGCC, pRNFL, TMV, and cup area between patients with tocilizumab, rituximab, and azathioprine in NMOSD<sup>ON+</sup> eyes. NMOSD<sup>ON-</sup> eyes did not display mGCC or pRNFL thinning in patients treated with tocilizumab and rituximab. Intriguingly, we observed significant thinning of mGCC in patients treated with azathioprine compared with tocilizumab [-0.84 (-1.50, -0.18) μm vs. -0.19 (-0.87, 0.48) μm, <i>p</i> = 0.012] and rituximab [-0.84 (-1.50, -0.18) μm vs. -0.07 (-1.25, -2.51) μm, <i>p</i> = 0.015] in NMOSD<sup>ON-</sup> eyes. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study demonstrated that retinal ganglion cell loss is independent of ON attacks in NMOSD. Tocilizumab and rituximab may delay mGCC thinning in NMOSD<sup>ON-</sup> eyes compared with azathioprine.","['azathioprine', 'neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder', 'retinal ganglion cells', 'rituximab', 'tocilizumab']"
Sodium-Glucose Co-Transporter 2 Inhibitors for Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Asian Patients With Type 2 Diabetes: A Meta-Analysis.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a very common disorder among patients with type 2 diabetes and may share causal relationship. Type 2 diabetes is a risk factor for progression and potential poor outcomes in NAFLD patients. This meta-analysis aimed to analyze the current evidence of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), a glucose-lowering drug to improve NAFLD in patients with Type 2 Diabetes.Medline, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched for articles examining efficacy of SGLT2i on treatments of NAFLD in type 2 diabetes in July 2020, and articles were sieved. Continuous data were extracted in the form of mean and standard deviation and were pooled with standardized mean difference (SMD).10 articles involving 555 patients from seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and three cohort studies, were included in this meta-analysis. Our analysis revealed significant improvements in hepatic fat content (after treatment: -0.789 (-1.404 to -0.175), p = 0.012; compared with control: -0.923 (-1.562 to -0.285), p = 0.005), AST (After Treatment: -0.539 (-0.720 to -0.357), p < 0.001; compared with control: -0.421 (-0.680 to -0.161), p = 0.001), ALT (after treatment: -0.633 (-0.892 to -0.373), p < 0.001; compared with Control: -0.468 (-0.685 to -0.251), p < 0.001), body composition (BMI: after treatment: -0.225 (-0.456 to 0.005), p = 0.055; compared with Control: -1.092 (-2.032 to -0.153), p = 0.023), glycemic control (HbA1c: After Treatment: -0.701 (-1.098 to -0.303), p = 0.001; compared with control: -0.210 (-0.603 to 0.183), p = 0.295), lipid parameters (Triglycerides: after treatment: -0.230 (-0.409 to -0.052), p = 0.011; compared with control: -0.336 (-0.597 to -0.076), p = 0.011), inflammatory markers (serum ferritin: after treatment: -0.409 (-0.694 to -0.124), p = 0.005; compared with control: -0.814 (-1.688 to 0.059), p = 0.068) after SGLT2i treatment, and when compared against controls. There was a trend in the improvement in fibrosis markers after SGLT2i treatment.SGLT2i is an effective treatment to improve NAFLD among patients with type 2 diabetes. Further studies are needed to understand the direct and indirect effects of SGLT2i on NAFLD and if SGLT2i could prevent the progression of NAFLD or NASH. SGLT2i could potentially be considered for patients with type 2 diabetes and NAFLD, if there are no contraindications.","['hepatic fat', 'metaanalysis', 'nonalcoholic fatty liver disease', 'sodiumglucose cotransporter2 inhibitors', 'type 2 diabetes']"
Socioeconomic Disparities in Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Serological Testing and Positivity in New York City.,"We characterized severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibody test prevalence and positive test prevalence across New York City (NYC) in order to investigate disparities in testing outcomes by race and socioeconomic status (SES).Serologic data were downloaded from the NYC Coronavirus data repository (August 2020-December 2020). Area-level characteristics for NYC neighborhoods were downloaded from United States census data and a socioeconomic vulnerability index was created. Spatial generalized linear mixed models were performed to examine the association between SES and antibody testing and positivity.The proportion of Hispanic population (posterior median, 0.001 [95% credible interval, 0.0003-0.002]), healthcare workers (0.003 [0.0001-0.006]), essential workers (0.003 [0.001-0.005]), age ≥65 years (0.003 [0.00002-0.006]), and high SES (SES quartile 3 vs 1: 0.034 [0.003-0.062]) were positively associated with antibody tests per 100000 residents. The White proportion (-0.002 [-0.003 to -0.001]), SES index (quartile 3 vs 1, -0.068 [-0.115 to -0.017]; quartile 4 vs 1, -0.077 [-0.134 to -0.018]) and age ≥65 years (-0.005 [-0.009 to -0.002]) were inversely associated with positive test prevalence (%), whereas the Hispanic (0.004 [0.002-0.006]) and essential worker (0.008 [0.003-0.012]) proportions had positive coefficients.Disparities in serologic testing and seropositivity exist on SES and race/ethnicity across NYC, indicative of excess coronavirus disease burden in vulnerable and marginalized populations.","['COVID19 disease', 'New York City', 'SARSCoV2', 'seroprevalence']"
Efficacy of hybrid minimally invasive esophagectomy <i>vs</i> open esophagectomy for esophageal cancer: A meta-analysis.,"The first line treatment regimen for esophageal cancer is still surgical resection and the choice of surgical scheme depends on surgeon. Now the efficacy comparison of hybrid minimally invasive esophagectomy (HMIE) and open esophagectomy (OE) is still controversial.To compare the perioperative and postoperative outcomes of HMIE and OE in patients with esophageal cancer.PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases were searched for related articles. The odds ratio (OR) or standard mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) was used to evaluate the effectiveness of HMIE and OE.Seventeen studies including a total of 2397 patients were selected. HMIE was significantly associated with less blood loss (SMD = -0.43, 95%CI: -0.66, -0.20; <i>P</i> = 0.0002) and lower incidence of pulmonary complications (OR = 0.72, 95%CI: 0.57, 0.90; <i>P</i> = 0.004). No significant differences were seen in the lymph node yield (SMD = 0.11, 95%CI: -0.08, 0.30; <i>P</i> = 0.26), operation time (SMD = 0.24, 95%CI: -0.14, 0.61; <i>P</i> = 0.22), total complications rate (OR = 0.68, 95%CI: 0.46, 0.99; <i>P</i> = 0.05), cardiac complication rate (OR = 0.91, 95%CI: 0.62, 1.34; <i>P</i> = 0.64), anastomotic leak rate (OR = 0.95, 95%CI: 0.67, 1.35; <i>P</i> = 0.78), duration of intensive care unit stay (SMD = -0.01, 95%CI: -0.21, 0.19; <i>P</i> = 0.93), duration of hospital stay (SMD = -0.13, 95%CI: -0.28, 0.01; <i>P</i> = 0.08), and total mortality rates (OR = 0.70, 95%CI: 0.47, 1.06; <i>P</i> = 0.09) between the two treatment groups.Compared with the OE, HMIE shows less blood loss and pulmonary complications. However, further studies are necessary to evaluate the long-term oncologic outcomes of HMIE.","['Esophageal cancer', 'Hybrid minimally invasive esophagectomy', 'Open esophagectomy']"
Association between essential hypertension and bone mineral density: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between essential hypertension (EH) and bone mineral density (BMD).17 articles were included in our meta-analysis, with a total of 39,491 patients. Of these, 13,375 were patients with EH and 26,116 were patients without EH. Meta-analysis results showed that EH can reduce the BMD of the lumbar spine (95% CI: -0.08∼0.01, P=0.006), femoral neck (95% CI: -0.09∼-0.02, <i>p</i> = 0.001), ward's triangle (95% CI: -0.45∼-0.25, p=0.000), femoral intertrochanteric (95% CI: -0.90∼-0.64, <i>p</i> = 0.000), calcaneus (95% CI: -0.31∼-0.18, <i>p</i> = 0.000) and distal forearm (95% CI: -0.09∼-0.03, <i>p</i> = 0.000), but EH cannot reduce the BMD of the femur rotor (95% CI: -0.07∼0.24, <i>p</i> = 0.273). Subgroup analysis showed that EH can reduce the BMD of the lumbar spine (95% CI: -0.11∼-0.03, <i>p</i> = 0.000) and femoral neck (95% CI: -0.11∼-0.07, <i>p</i> = 0.000) in Asian populations. In non-Asian populations, EH can reduce the BMD of the femoral neck (95% CI: 0.04∼0.19, <i>p</i> = 0.002), but cannot reduce the BMD of the lumbar spine (95% CI: -0.04∼0.11, <i>p</i> = 0.346).We conducted a systematic review of the published literature on the association of EH and BMD by searching the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, CBM, CNKI and VIP databases inception to October 2016. Stata 11.0 software was used for data analysis.Our meta-analysis suggests that EH can reduce the BMD of the human body, and for different parts of the bone, the degree of reduction is different. In addition, for different regions and populations, the reduction level of BMD is inconsistent.","['association', 'bone mineral density', 'essential hypertension', 'metaanalysis']"
Role of Neurofilament Light Chain as a Potential Biomarker for Alzheimer's Disease: A Correlative Meta-Analysis.,"Neurofilament light (NFL) is a putative biomarker of neurodegeneration. This study evaluates the correlative association of NFL with Alzheimer's disease (AD) indices. Relevant studies were identified after a literature search in electronic databases and study selection was based on pre-determined eligibility criteria. Correlation coefficients between NFL levels and important AD indices reported by individual studies were pooled as z-scores. Meta-regression analyses were performed to evaluate the relationships between important covariates. Data from 38 studies (age 68.3 years [95% confidence interval (CI): 65.7, 70.9]; 54 % [95% CI: 50, 57] females) were used. Meta-analyses of correlation coefficients reported by the included studies showed that NFL levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) correlated well (<i>r</i> = 0.59 [95% CI: 0.45, 0.71]; <i>p</i> < 0.0001). NFL levels correlated with MMSE score (<i>r</i> = -0.345 [95% CI: -0.43, -0.25]; <i>p</i> = 0.0001), and age (<i>r</i> = 0.485 [95% CI: 0.35, 0.61]; <i>p</i> = 0.00001). CSF NFL levels correlated with total tau (t-tau; <i>r</i> = 0.39 [95% CI: 0.27, 0.50]; <i>p</i> = 0.0001), phosphorylated tau (p-tau; <i>r</i> = 0.34 [95% CI: 0.19, 0.47]; <i>p</i> = 0.00001), and neurogranin (<i>r</i> = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.12, 0.37]; <i>p</i> = 0.001) but not with beta amyloid (Aβ) (<i>r</i> = 0.00 [95%CI: -0.13, 0.12]; <i>p</i> = 0.937). In meta-regression, MMSE scores were associated inversely with blood NFL (metaregression coefficient (MC) -0.236 [95% CI:-0.40, -0.072; <i>p</i> = 0.008), and age (MC) -0.235 [-0.36, -0.11]; <i>p</i> = 0.001) and positively with CSF Aβ-42 (MC 0.017 [0.010, 0.023]; <i>p</i> = 0.00001). NFL has good correlations with t-tau, and p-tau in CSF and CSF NFL levels correlates well with blood NFL levels. These results show that NFL can be a useful biomarker for improving diagnosis and predicting prognosis in AD patients especially if age weighted.","['Alzheimers disease', 'biomarker', 'correlation', 'diagnosis', 'neurofilament light']"
Public mental health during and after the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic: Opportunities for intervention <i>via</i> emotional self-efficacy and resilience.,"During the pandemic, the number of United States adults reporting clinically significant symptoms of anxiety and depression sky-rocketed, up from 11% in 2020 to more than 40% in 2021. Our current mental healthcare system cannot adequately accommodate the current crisis; it is therefore important to identify opportunities for public mental health interventions.Assess whether modifiable emotional factors may offer a point of intervention for the mental health crisis.From January 13 to 15, 2022, adults living in the United States were recruited <i>via</i> Amazon Mechanical Turk to complete an anonymous survey.Linear regressions tested whether the primary outcomes during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (depressive and anxiety symptoms, burnout) were associated with hypothesized modifiable risk factors (loneliness and need for closure) and hypothesized modifiable protective factors (the ability to perceive emotions and connect with others emotionally; emotion-regulation efficacy; and resilience, or the ability to ""bounce back"" after negative events).The sample included 1,323 adults (mean [SD] age 41.42 [12.52] years; 636 women [48%]), almost half of whom reported clinically significant depressive (29%) and/or anxiety (15%) symptoms. Approximately 90% of participants indicated feeling burned out at least once a year and nearly half of participants (45%) felt burned out once a week or more. In separate analyses, depressive symptoms (Model A), anxiety symptoms (Model B), and burnout (Model C) were statistically significantly associated with loneliness (βModel A, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.33-0.43; βModel B, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.26-0.36; βModel C, 0.34; 95% CI, 0.28-0.41), need for closure (βModel A, 0.09; 95% CI, 1.03-1.06; βModel B, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.97-0.17; βModel C, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.07-0.16), recent stressful life events (βModel A, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.10-0.17; βModel B, 0.14; 95% CI, 0.11-0.18; βModel C, 0.10; 95% CI, 0.06-0.15), and resilience (βModel A, -0.10; 95% CI, -0.15 to -0.05; βModel B, -0.18; 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.13; βModel C, -0.11; 95% CI, -0.17 to -0.05). In addition, depressive and anxiety symptoms were associated with emotional self-efficacy (βModel A, -0.17; 95% CI, -0.22 to -0.12; βModel B, -0.11; 95% CI, -0.17 to -0.06), and beliefs about the malleability of emotions (βModel A, -0.08; 95% CI, -0.12 to -0.03; βModel B, -0.09; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.04). Associations between loneliness and symptoms were weaker among those with more emotional self-efficacy, more endorsement of emotion malleability beliefs, and greater resilience, in separate models. Analyses controlled for recent stressful life events, optimism, and social desirability.Public mental health interventions that teach resilience in response to negative events, emotional self-efficacy, and emotion-regulation efficacy may protect against the development of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and burnout, particularly in the context of a collective trauma. Emotional self-efficacy and regulation efficacy may mitigate the association between loneliness and mental health, but loneliness prevention research is also needed to address the current mental health crisis.","['COVID19', 'burnout', 'depression', 'emotional selfefficacy', 'loneliness', 'public mental health', 'resilience']"
Relationships between feeding and glucose concentrations in healthy term infants during the first five days after birth-the Glucose in Well Babies Study (GLOW).,"The World Health Organization recommends breastfeeding be commenced as soon as possible after birth. Amongst other benefits, early feeding is expected to support the metabolic transition after birth, but effects on blood glucose concentrations are controversial. We sought to describe the changes in interstitial glucose concentrations after feedings over the first five postnatal days.In healthy singleton term infants, all feeds were recorded using a smart phone app. Glucose concentrations were measured by blinded interstitial monitoring, calibrated by heel-prick capillary samples 2-4 times/d. Feeding sessions were included if a start and end time were recorded, and if the interval between the start of successive feeds was >90 min. The area under the glucose concentration curve (AUC) was calculated by trapezoidal addition from baseline (median of the 3 measurements before the beginning of the session). The maximum deviation (MD) was the greatest change in glucose concentration (positive or negative) from baseline to the next feeding session or 180 min, whichever came first. Data were analyzed using Stata V17 and are presented as mean (95% CI) in mmol/L.Data were available for 62 infants and 1,770 feedings. The glucose response to breastfeeding was not different from zero on day 1 [day 1 AUC 0.05 (-0.00, 0.10), MD 0.06 (-0.05, 0.16)], but increased thereafter (day 3 (AUC 0.23 (0.18, 0.28), MD 0.41 (0.32, 0.50), day 5 AUC 0.11 (0.06, 0.16), MD 0.28 (0.18, 0.37), <i>p</i> < 0.001 for age effect). Glucose response increased with increased duration of breastfeeding (<30 min AUC 0.06 (0.02,0.09), MD 0.12 (0.04,0.19), >30 min AUC 0.20 (0.16, 0.23) MD 0.37 (0.30, 0.44), <i>p</i> < 0.001 for duration effect) and this was observed even in the first 2 days (<30 min AUC-0.02 (-0.06, 0.03), MD -0.06 (-0.15, 0.03), >30 min AUC 0.12 (0.08, 0.16), MD 0.19 (0.11, 0.27), overall <i>p</i> < 0.001 for age x duration interaction). In feeding sessions that were not breastfeeding, the glucose response was greater after formula than after expressed human milk [AUC 0.29 (0.15, 0.29), MD 0.48 (-0.12, 0.61)], and greater after feed volumes >20 ml than <10 ml [20-30 ml AUC 0.19 (0.01, 0.27), MD 0.23 (-0.01, 0.46)].The glucose response to feeding in the days after birth increases with postnatal age and duration of the feeding episode. Breastfeeding for <30 min has little effect on glucose concentrations in the first two days.","['continuous interstitial glucose monitoring', 'feeding', 'glucose', 'infant', 'newborn']"
The effect of variation of tetrahydropentagamavunon-0 concentration in lotion and emulgel formula toward acute dermal irritation study.,"Tetrahydropentagamavunon-0 (THPGV-0) is a curcumin metabolite analog which known has a higher antioxidant activity than Vitamin E. This compound has been formulated in lotion as antiaging cosmetics, but the irritation effect is unknown yet. This study aims to analyze the effect of variation of THPGV-0 concentration in lotion and emulgel formula toward acute dermal irritation. The concentrations of THPGV-0 varied to 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.4% in lotion/emulgel and tested for their physical properties such as organoleptic, homogeneity, pH, spreadability, and adhesion. Acute dermal irritation test is done in accordance with the <i>In vivo</i> Nonclinical Toxicity Test Guidelines by the Indonesian Food and Drug Administration (BPOM). This study showed that Primary Irritation Index (PII) value concentrations of 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.4% THPGV-0 in lotion formula are 0.014, 0.014, and 0.028 (close to 0) and in emulgel formula are 0.08 at concentration of 0.1%, 0.33 at concentration of 0.2%, and 0.25 at concentration of 0.4%. PII of 0.1%, 0.2%, and 0.4% THPGV-0 in lotion and emulgel is included in negligible irritation response. Hence, the both of THPGV-0 formula in lotion and emulgel are considered safe to use on skin according to this study.","['Emulgel', 'irritation', 'lotion', 'tetrahydropentagamavunon0']"
Evaluation of chromogenic culture media for rapid identification of microorganisms isolated from cows with clinical and subclinical mastitis.,"This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance (specificity, Sp; sensitivity, Se; accuracy; positive predictive value; negative predictive value; and Cohen's kappa coefficient, κ, of agreement) of chromogenic culture media for rapid identification of microorganisms isolated from cows with clinical (CM) and subclinical mastitis (SCM). For this, 2 experiments were carried out: evaluation of (1) biplate, and (2) triplate of chromogenic culture media for rapid identification of mastitis-causing microorganisms. For the evaluation of diagnostic performance, identification of microorganisms by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was considered the standard methodology. In experiment 1, 476 milk samples collected from cows with CM and 660 from cows with SCM were evaluated by inoculation in 2 selective chromogenic culture media (CHROMagar) for gram-positive bacteria and another for gram-negative bacteria. In experiment 2, 476 milk samples from cows with CM and 500 from cows with SCM were evaluated by inoculation in triplate chromogenic culture media (Smartcolor2, Onfarm), selective for Streptococcus and Strep-like organisms, Staphylococcus, and gram-negative bacteria. In experiment 1 for the CM samples, the use of biplates with gram-positive and gram-negative culture media showed Se that ranged from 0.56 (0.32-0.81; Staphylococcus aureus) to 0.90 (0.80-0.99 Streptococcus uberis), Sp varied from 0.94 (0.92-0.96; Strep. uberis) to 1.00 (Prototheca spp. or yeast), and κ ranged from 0.47 (0.26-0.67; Staph. aureus) to 0.84 (0.78-0.9; Escherichia coli). The Se of biplates for SCM samples ranged from 0.50 (0.15-0.85; E. coli) to 0.94 (0.87-1.00; Staph. aureus), Sp varied from 0.95 (0.93-0.97; Strep. uberis) to 0.99 (0.98-1.00; Staph. aureus and Strep. Agalactiae or dysgalactiae), and κ ranged from 0.18 (0.00-0.40; Escherichia coli) to 0.88 (0.80-0.95; Staph. aureus). In experiment 2, the Se of the triplate chromogenic media in CM samples ranged from 0.09 (0.00-0.26; Serratia spp.) to 0.94 (0.85-1.00; Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp.), Sp varied from 0.94 (0.92-0.96; Strep. agalactiae and Strep. dysgalactiae) to 1.00 (Serratia spp.) and κ ranged from 0.07 (0.00-0.24; Serratia spp.) to 0.85 (0.75-0.94; Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp.). For SCM samples, the use of the triplate with the chromogenic culture media showed Se that varied from 0.25 (0.10-0.40; Lactococcus spp.) to 1.00 (Strep. Agalactiae or dysgalactiae), Sp ranged from 0.92 (0.90-0.94; Strep. Agalactiae and Strep. dysgalactiae) to 0.99 (0.98-1.00; Klebsiella spp. and Enterobacter spp.), and κ varied from 0.28 (0.00-0.72; E. coli) to 0.72 (0.60-0.82; Staph. aureus). Our results suggest that the diagnostic accuracy of the biplate and triplate of chromogenic culture media varies according to pathogen, and the results of chromogenic culture media may be useful for rapid decision-making on mastitis treatment protocols of the main mastitis-causing microorganisms, but their use for implementation of mastitis control measures will depend on each farm specific needs.","['chromogenic media', 'dairy cow', 'mastitis', 'onfarm culture']"
Relationship between the estimates of desaturase activities and cardiometabolic phenotypes in Koreans.,"In the present study, we evaluated the relationships of estimated desaturase activities with cardiometabolic risk factors including abdominal obesity, atherogenic lipoprotein phenotype and inflammation in Koreans. Ninety-three healthy volunteers participated in this cross-sectional study. LDL particle size was determined using gradient gel electrophoresis and inflammatory markers including C-reactive protein, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, and adiponectin were measured. Stearoyl-coA desaturase, delta-6 desaturase and delta-5 desaturase were estimated as precursor to fatty acid ratios. The results showed that stearoyl-coA desaturase was correlated with body mass index (r = 0.235, p<0.05), triglyceride (r = 0.261, p<0.001), and HDL-cholesterol (r = -0.226, p<0.05). Stearoyl-coA desaturase was associated with only triglyceride (r = 0.283, p<0.01). Delta-6 desaturase was correlated with body mass index (r = 0.236, p<0.05), waist circumference (r = 0.218, p<0.05), triglyceride (r = 0.399, p<0.001), C-reactive protein (r = 0.333, p<0.001), soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (r = 0.229, p<0.05), HDL-cholesterol (r = -0.325, p<0.01), LDL particle size (r = -0.297, p<0.01) and adiponectin (r = -0.233, p<0.05). In contrast, delta-5 desaturase was correlated with body mass index (r = -0.324, p<0.01), waist circumference (r = -0.276, p<0.01), triglyceride (r = -0.329, p<0.01), C-reactive protein (r = -0.215, p<0.05), HDL-cholesterol (r = 0.262, p<0.05) and LDL particle size (r = 0.278, p<0.01). Stepwise multiple regression analysis revealed that delta-6 desaturase (p<0.01) together with waist circumference (p<0.001) were found to be independent factors for determining plasma levels of C-reactive protein (R(2) = 0.230). Estimated desaturase activities are closely associated with the features of cardiometabolic risk in Koreans.","['atherogenic dyslipidemia', 'cardiometabolic risk factor', 'desaturase', 'fatty acid composition', 'inflammation']"
Health-related quality of life in Chinese inpatients with lung cancer treatedin large general hospitals: across-sectional study.,"In China, psychosocial problems of patients with cancer are under-recognised and undertreated in medical oncology practice. This study examined the health-related quality of life (QOL) in inpatients with lung cancer treated in large general hospitals and explored the demographic, clinical and psychosocial factors associated with QOL.Cross-sectional study.Altogether, 148 inpatients with lung cancer were consecutively recruited from two large general hospitals in Tianjin, China.QOL, pain intensity, depressive and anxiety symptoms, and social support were assessed with WHO QOL Scale Brief Version, four-point Verbal Rating Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and Social Support Rating Scale, respectively.Compared with the normative data for the Chinese general population, patients had significantly lower scores in physical (t=-25.860, p<0.001) and psychological (t=-18.225, p<0.001) QOL. Being unmarried (β=-2.471, 95% CI -4.908 to -0.034), poor economic status (β=-1.764, 95% CI -2.964 to -0.564), cancer metastasis (β=-1.328, 95% CI -2.632 to -0.024), poor performance status (β=-0.959, 95% CI -1.542 to -0.376), depression (β=-0.465, 95% CI -0.631 to -0.299), anxiety (β=-0.208, 95% CI -0.354 to -0.062) and low utilisation of social support (β=-0.344, 95% CI -0.577 to -0.111) were independently associated with poor physical QOL, while female gender (β=-1.494, 95% CI -0.649 to -2.339), less education years (β=-0.209, 95% CI -0.294 to -0.123), currently receiving chemotherapy (β=-1.536, 95% CI -3.051 to -0.021), small-cell cancer (β=-1.157, 95% CI -2.223 to -0.091), more intense pain (β=-0.535, 95% CI -0.919 to -0.151), poor performance status (β=-0.930, 95% CI -1.383 to -0.477), anxiety (β=-0.178, 95% CI -0.248 to -0.108) and inadequate subjective social support (β=-0.137, 95% CI -0.153 to -0.121) were independently associated with poor psychological QOL.Inpatients with lung cancer treated in Chinese large general hospitals have poorer QOL than the general population. Effective prevention and management of psychosocial problems are potentially effective to improve their QOL.","['lung cancer', 'psychosocial factor', 'quality of life']"
The International Diet-Health Index: a novel tool to evaluate diet quality for cardiometabolic health across countries.,"Diet is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiometabolic disease; however, interpretable measures capturing impacts of overall diet on health that can be easily used by policymakers at the global/national levels are not readily available.We developed the International Diet-Health Index (IDHI) to measure health impacts of dietary intake across 186 countries in 2010, using age-specific and sex-specific data on country-level dietary intake, effects of dietary factors on cardiometabolic diseases and country-specific cardiometabolic disease profiles. The index encompasses the impact of 11 foods/nutrients on 12 cardiometabolic diseases, the mediation of health effects of specific dietary intakes through blood pressure and body mass index and background disease prevalence in each country-age-sex group. We decomposed the index into IDHI<sub>beneficial</sub> for risk-reducing factors, and IDHI<sub>adverse</sub> for risk-increasing factors. The flexible functional form of the IDHI allows inclusion of additional risk factors and diseases as data become available.By sex, women experienced smaller detrimental cardiometabolic effects of diet than men: (females IDHI<sub>adverse</sub> range: -0.480 (5th percentile, 95th percentile: -0.932, -0.300) to -0.314 (-0.543, -0.213); males IDHI<sub>adverse</sub> range: (-0.617 (-1.054, -0.384) to -0.346 (-0.624, -0.222)). By age, middle-aged adults had highest IDHI<sub>beneficial</sub> (females: 0.392 (0.235, 0.763); males: 0.415 (0.243, 0.949)) and younger adults had most extreme IDHI<sub>adverse</sub> (females: -0.480 (-0.932, -0.300); males: -0.617 (-1.054, -0.384)). Regionally, Central Latin America had the lowest IDHI<sub>overall</sub> (-0.466 (-0.892, -0.159)), while Southeast Asia had the highest IDHI<sub>overall</sub> (0.272 (-0.224, 0.903)). IDHI<sub>overall</sub> was highest in low-income countries and lowest in upper middle-income countries (-0.039 (-0.317, 0.227) and -0.146 (-0.605, 0.303), respectively). Among 186 countries, Honduras had lowest IDHI<sub>overall</sub> (-0.721 (-0.916, -0.207)), while Malaysia had highest IDHI<sub>overall</sub> (0.904 (0.435, 1.190)).IDHI encompasses dietary intakes, health effects and country disease profiles into a single index, allowing policymakers a useful means of assessing/comparing health impacts of diet quality between populations.","['cardiovascular disease', 'diabetes', 'epidemiology', 'nutrition', 'public health']"
"Timing, intensity, and duration of household food insecurity are associated with early childhood development in Kenya.","This study examines the association between 3 dimensions of food insecurity (timing, intensity, and duration) and 3 domains of child development (gross motor, communication, and personal social). Longitudinal data from 303 households (n = 309 children) visited 9 times over 2 years were collected. Children in households experiencing severe food insecurity 3 months prior (timing) had significantly lower gross motor (β -0.14; 95% CI [0.27, -0.0033]; p = .045), communication (β -0.16; 95% CI [-0.30, -0.023]; p = .023), and personal social (β -0.20; 95% CI [-0.33, -0.073]; p = .002) Z-scores, using lagged longitudinal linear models controlling for current food insecurity; these results were attenuated in full models, which included maternal education, household asset index, and child anthropometry. Children in households that experienced greater aggregate food insecurity over the past 2 years (intensity) had significantly lower gross motor (β -0.047; 95% CI [-0.077, -0.018]; p = .002), communication (β -0.042; 95% CI [-0.076, -0.0073]; p = .018), and personal social (β -0.042; 95% CI [-0.074, -0.010]; p = .010) Z-scores; these results were also attenuated in full models. Children with more time exposed to food insecurity (duration) had significantly lower gross motor (β -0.050; 95% CI [-0.087, -0.012]; p = .010), communication (β -0.042; 95% CI [-0.086, 0.0013]; p = .057), and personal social (β -0.037; 95% CI [-0.077, 0.0039]; p = .076) Z-scores; these results were no longer significant in full models. Our findings suggest that acute and chronic food insecurity and child development are related, but that many associations are attenuated with the inclusion of relevant covariates.","['Kenya', 'Lake Victoria', 'early childhood development', 'food security', 'stunting']"
Comparison of outcomes with multifocal intraocular lenses: a meta-analysis.,"To compare the clinical outcome of different multifocal intraocular lenses (IOLs) based on information reported in the international literature.All comparative clinical trials that involved implanting at least one multifocal IOL in patients with cataract or presbyopia were extracted from the literature. Clinical outcomes included uncorrected near visual acuity, uncorrected distance visual acuity, visual acuity, spectacle independence, and halos. Random effects meta-analyses were conducted to compare outcomes for the different IOL types.Twenty papers were identified describing 11 monofocal IOLs and 35 multifocal IOLs (19 diffractive, including 12 ReSTOR(®), 14 refractive, and two accommodative) patient cohorts. Multifocal and monofocal uncorrected distance visual acuity was 0.165 (0.090-0.240) and 0.093 (0.088-0.098), respectively. Compared with monofocal IOLs, multifocal IOLs produced better uncorrected near visual acuity (0.470 [0.322-0.618] versus 0.141 [0.131-0.152]; P < 0.0001), resulting in higher spectacle independence (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 3.62 [2.90-4.52]; P < 0.0001). Compared with refractive multifocal IOLs, diffractive multifocal IOLs produced a similar uncorrected distance visual acuity (0.105 [0.098-0.111] versus 0.085 [0.029-0.140]; P ≤ 0.78, not significant) and better uncorrected near visual acuity (0.217 [0.118-0.317] versus 0.082 [0.067-0.098]; P < 0.0001) resulting in higher spectacle independence (IRR 1.75 [1.24-2.48]; P < 0.001). Compared with other multifocal IOLs, ReSTOR produced a better uncorrected distance visual acuity (0.067 [0.059-0.076] versus 0.093 [0.088-0.098]; P < 0.0001) and better uncorrected near visual acuity (0.064 [0.046-0.082] versus 0.141 [0.131-0.152]; P < 0.006), resulting in higher spectacle independence (IRR 2.06 [1.26-1.36]; P < 0.004). Halo incidence rates with different types of multifocal implants did not differ significantly.Multifocal IOLs provide better uncorrected near visual acuity than monofocal IOLs, leading to less need for spectacles. Multifocal IOL design might play a role in postsurgical outcome, because better results were obtained with diffractive lenses. ReSTOR showed better uncorrected near visual acuity, uncorrected distance visual acuity, and higher spectacle independence rates compared with other multifocal IOLs.","['metaanalysis', 'multifocal implants', 'patient satisfaction', 'spectacle independence', 'uncorrected distance visual acuity', 'uncorrected near visual acuity']"
Value of Blood-Based microRNAs in the Diagnosis of Acute Myocardial Infarction: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"<b>Background:</b> Recent studies have shown that blood-based miRNAs are dysregulated in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and are therefore a potential tool for the diagnosis of AMI. Therefore, this study summarized and evaluated studies focused on microRNAs as novel biomarkers for the diagnosis of AMI from the last ten years. <b>Methods:</b> MEDLINE, the Cochrane Central database, and EMBASE were searched between January 2010 and December 2019. Studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of circulating microRNAs in AMI were chosen. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio, and area under the curve (AUC) were used to assess the test performance of miRNAs. <b>Results:</b> A total of 58 studies that included 8,206 participants assessed the diagnostic accuracy of circulating miRNAs in AMI. The main results of the meta-analyses are as follows: (1) Total miRNAs: the overall pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.82 (95% CI: 0.79-0.85) and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84-0.90), respectively. The AUC value was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.88-0.93) in the overall summary receiver operator characteristic (SROC) curve. (2) The panel of two miRNAs: sensitivity: 0.88 (95% CI: 0.77-0.94), specificity: 0.84 (95% CI: 0.72-0.91), AUC: 0.92 (95% CI: 0.90-0.94). (3) The panel of three miRNAs: sensitivity: 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85-0.94), specificity: 0.87 (95% CI: 0.77-0.92), AUC: 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89-0.94). (4) Results by types of miRNAs: miRNA-1: sensitivity: 0.78 (95% CI: 0.71-0.84), specificity: 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77-0.91), AUC: 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85-0.90); miRNA-133a: sensitivity: 0.85 (95% CI: 0.69-0.94), specificity: 0.92 (95% CI: 0.61-0.99), AUC: 0.93 (95% CI: 0.91-0.95); miRNA-208b: sensitivity: 0.80 (95% CI: 0.69-0.88), specificity: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.77-0.99), AUC: 0.91 (95% CI: 0.88-0.93); miRNA-499: sensitivity: 0.85 (95% CI: 0.77-0.91), specificity: 0.95 (95% CI: 0.89-0.98), AUC: 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94-0.97). <b>Conclusion:</b> miRNAs may be used as potential biomarkers for the detection of AMI. For single, stand-alone miRNAs, miRNA-499 may have better diagnostic accuracy compared to other miRNAs. We propose that a panel of multiple miRNAs with high sensitivity and specificity should be tested.","['acute myocardial infarction', 'biomarker', 'diagnosis', 'metaanalysis', 'miRNAs']"
"Inter-rater agreement and reliability of thoracic ultrasonographic findings in feedlot calves, with or without naturally occurring bronchopneumonia.","Thoracic ultrasonography (TUS) can be used to assess the extent and severity of lung lesions associated with bronchopneumonia (BP) in feedlot cattle.To assess inter-rater agreement and reliability of TUS findings in feedlot cattle, with or without naturally occurring BP.Feedlot steers with (n = 210) or without (n = 107) clinical signs of BP that were assessed by TUS in a previous case-control study.A random sample of 50 TUS videos (16-s duration) were scored by 6 raters with various levels of TUS expertise. Lung consolidation, comet tail artifacts, pleural irregularity and effusion were scored. Inter-rater agreement was assessed using raw percentage of agreement (Pa), Cohen's and Fleiss' Kappa (κ), and Gwet agreement coefficient (AC1). Intra-class correlation (ICC) was determined for variables with continuous measurements (mixed factorial design).Median (interquartile range [IQR]) Pa were 0.84 (0.80-0.89), 0.82 (0.80-0.87), 0.62 (0.53-0.67), and 0.82 (0.75-0.86) for presence of lung consolidation, comet tails, pleural irregularity, and pleural effusion, respectively. For the same lesions, Fleiss κ (95% confidence intervals [CI]) were 0.67 (0.49-0.86), 0.56 (0.33-0.80), 0.20 (-0.05 to 0.44), and 0.36 (0.10-0.61), respectively. AC1 were 0.68 (0.51-0.86), 0.73 (0.58-0.89), 0.21 (-0.01 to 0.44), and 0.71 (0.51-0.92), respectively. Moderate reliability was found among raters for all quantitative variables (ICC ranged from 0.52 to 0.70).Inter-rater agreement was good for presence of lung consolidation, comet tails and pleural effusion (based on Pa and AC1) but was slight to poor for pleural irregularity.","['bovine respiratory disease', 'cattle', 'infectious diseases', 'radiology and diagnostic imaging', 'respiratory tract']"

Various Expressions of <i>PIK3C2A</i> and <i>TXNIP</i> Genes and Their Potential Role as Independent Risk Factors for Chronic Stable Angina and Acute Coronary Syndrome.,"Genetic factors play a significant role in the onset and progression of coronary artery disease (CAD). <i>PIK3C2A</i> may contribute to the development of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) by affecting blood glucose levels and oxidative stress. The expression levels of <i>TXNIP</i> were significantly higher in patients with unstable angina pectoris. However, the situation is different in ACS. In the current study, we aim to investigate the role of <i>PIK3C2A</i> and <i>TXNIP</i> as independent risk factors for chronic stable angina (CSA) and ACS.This study involved 215 subjects (60 patients with CSA, 55 patients with ACS, and 100 controls). All subjects were exposed for assaying gene expressions of <i>PIK3C2A</i> and <i>TXNIP</i> by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction.It was found that <i>TXNIP</i> was upregulated, whereas <i>PIK3C2A</i> was downregulated in patients with CAD compared to the control group. <i>PIK3C2A</i> was significantly downregulated in patients with ACS compared to that in patients with CSA (<i>p</i> < 0.001), but <i>TXNIP</i> was not (<i>p</i> = 0.7). <i>TXNIP</i> was significantly upregulated in STEMI-ACS patients compared to CSA (<i>p</i> = 0.045) and NSTEMI ACS (<i>p</i> = 0.046), among non-diabetic (<i>p</i> = 0.023) smokers (<i>p</i> = 0.036) with hypertension (<i>p</i> = 0.005) and hypercholesterolemia (<i>p</i> = 0.001). ROC (receiver operating characteristic) curve analysis revealed that <i>PIK3C2A</i> (0.981; <i>p</i> < 0.001; 98.18) was the most sensitive mRNA for discriminating ACS from control, followed by <i>TXNIP</i> (0.775; <i>p</i> < 0.001; 70.91). However, for discriminating ACS from CSA combined mRNAs, (<i>PIK3C2A + TXNIP</i>) (0.893; <i>p</i> < 0.001; 98.18) and <i>PIK3C2A</i> (0.892; <i>p</i> < 0.001; 81.82) are promising biomarkers. On the other hand, the most sensitive mRNA for differentiating CSA from control is mRNAs (<i>PIK3C2A + TXNIP</i>) (0.963; <i>p</i> < 0.001; 95), then <i>TXINP</i> (81.3; <i>p</i> < 0.001; 93.33), and finally, <i>PIK3C2A</i> (0.782; <i>p</i> < 0.001; 81.67). In the multivariate regression model, <i>PIK3C2A</i> ((<i>p</i> = 0.002), 0.118 (0.031-0.445)) and smoking status ((<i>p</i> = 0.034); 0.151 (0.026-0.866)) were independent variables for ACS. Moreover, <i>PIK3C2A</i> ((<i>p</i> < 0.013); 0.706 (0.614-0.812)), Hb ((<i>p</i> = 0.013); 0.525 (0.317-0.871)), and total cholesterol ((<i>p</i> = 0.04); 0.865 (0.784-0.955)) were significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.05) and independently related to the prognosis of CSA. Furthermore, <i>PIK3C2A</i> ((<i>p</i> = 0.002), 0.923 (0.877-0.971)), <i>TXNIP</i> ((<i>p</i> = 0.001); 2.809 (1.558-5.064)) the body weight ((<i>p</i> = 0.033); 1.254 (1.018-1.544)) were independently associated with CSA.Our study concluded that the dysregulated mRNA <i>PIK3C2A</i> and <i>TXNIP</i> gene expressions may be useful in diagnosis of CAD and prediction of ACS development.","['ACS', 'CSA', 'PIK3C2A', 'TXNIP', 'realtime PCR']"
Poor health literacy associated with stronger perceived barriers to breast cancer screening and overestimated breast cancer risk.,"Low health literacy (HL) is negatively associated with mammography screening uptake. However, evidence of the links between poor HL and low mammography screening participation is scarce.We conducted a cross-sectional questionnaire survey among participants of a cancer screening program. We measured HL using a validated Chinese instrument. We assessed breast cancer screening-related beliefs using the Health Belief Model and the accuracy of risk perception. We used multivariable regression models to estimate the relationship between HL and the outcomes.A total of 821 females were included. 264 (32.2%) had excellent or sufficient, 353 (43.0%) had problematic, and 204 (24.8%) had inadequate health literacy (IHL). Women with IHL were more likely to agree that high price (β = -0.211, 95% CI -0.354 to -0.069), lack of time (β = -0.219, 95% CI -0.351 to -0.088), inconvenient service time (β = -0.291, 95% CI -0.421 to -0.160), long waiting time (β = -0.305, 95% CI -0.447 to -0.164), fear of positive results (β = -0.200, 95% CI -0.342 to -0.058), embarrassment (β = -0.225, 95% CI -0.364 to -0.086), fear of pain (β = -0.154, 95% CI -0.298 to -0.010), fear of radiation (β = -0.177, 95% CI -0.298 to -0.056), lack of knowledge on service location (β = -0.475, 95% CI -0.615 to -0.335), and lack of knowledge on mammography (β = -0.360, 95% CI -0.492 to -0.228) were barriers. They were also less likely to have an accurate breast cancer risk perception (aOR 0.572, 95% CI 0.341 to 0.956).Women with lower HL could have stronger perceived barriers to BC screening and an over-estimation of their breast cancer risk. Tackling emotional and knowledge barriers, financial and logistical assistance, and guidance on risk perception are needed to increase their breast cancer screening uptake.","['barrier', 'cancer screening MeSH', 'health literacy', 'overestimate', 'risk perception']"
A Clinically Relevant Method of Quantifying the Mechanical Properties of RockTape® Kinesiology Tape at Different Elongation Lengths.,"Kinesiology tape (KT) is a therapeutic intervention used to treat different musculoskeletal conditions and to enhance sports performance. The evidence is inconclusive, with researchers attributing the variable outcomes to different manufactured KT used in the research. Researchers have begun to measure and document the mechanical properties of different brands, using machines versus professionals. This prevents a clear translation to clinical practice, as it may be difficult to reproduce outcomes. There is a need to measure the mechanical properties of KT using more clinically relevant methodology.The purpose was to document a clinically relevant method of measuring the mechanical properties of 2 different types of precut RockTape® tape at common elongation lengths and to establish the methodology for future validation research on this testing method.Controlled laboratory study.University laboratory.One researcher conducted all measurements.Each tape was measured at 3 elongation lengths with a force gauge.Force, stress, and Young modulus.The RockTape® 2 and RockTape® 3 elongation force were 25% = 2.27 (0.21) and 2.12 (0.26) N, 50% = 6.51 (0.27) and 5.93 (0.20) N, and 75% = 30.13 (0.63) and 21.23 (0.41) N. The stress values for the RockTape® 2 and RockTape® 3 were 25% = 0.88 (0.05) and 0.82 (0.03) kPa, 50% = 2.52 (0.03) and 2.29 (0.01) kPa, and 75% = 11.67 (0.04) and 8.23 (0.02) kPa.

Meta-analysis of contrast-enhanced ultrasound and contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasound for the diagnosis of gallbladder malignancy.,"The diagnosis between benign and malignant gallbladder lesions is sometimes difficult. The objective of this study is to assess whether contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and contrast-enhanced harmonic endoscopic ultrasound (CH-EUS) can be an accurate method for detecting gallbladder malignancy and to determine which imaging signs can be indicative of malignancy.A study search of PubMed, Elsevier, and Sciencedirect was performed in May 2019. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve were used to examine the accuracy of CEUS and CH-EUS.Twenty-one studies were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivities of CEUS and CH-EUS were 0.81 (0.75-0.86) and 0.92 (0.86-0.95); the specificities were 0.94 (0.90-0.96) and 0.89 (0.69-0. 97); the DORs were 64 (32-127) and 89 (22-354); and the area under the SROC curves were 0.90 (0.87-0.92) and 0.92 (0.90-0.94). On CEUS, the diagnostic criterion for gallbladder malignancy according to four features were analyzed. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.75 (0.65-0.83) and 0.98 (0.85-1.00) for integrity of gallbladder wall; 0.69 (0.55-0.81) and 0.89 (0.77-0.95) for heterogeneous enhancement; 0.81 (0.71-0.88) and 0.88 (0.76-0.94) for irregular vessels; and 0.81 (0.66-0.91) and 0.75 (0.59-0.86) for washout time within 28 s. On CH-EUS, heterogeneous enhancement could be indicative of malignant lesions with a sensitivity of 0.94 (0.85-0.97); and the specificity was 0.92 (0.71-0.98).CEUS and CH-EUS are promising and reliable imaging modalities with a high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of gallbladder malignancy. CH-EUS might be more sensitive than CEUS with a higher sensitivity. In addition, irregular tralesional vessels and washout time within 28 s on CEUS and heterogeneous enhancement on CH-EUS are indicative of malignancy. However, larger scale and well-designed studies are warranted to verify our results.","['Contrastenhanced ultrasound', 'Diagnosis', 'Endoscopic ultrasonography', 'Gallbladder', 'Malignant lesions', 'Metaanalysis']"
Racial disparities in supportive medication use among older patients with brain metastases: a population-based analysis.,"Brain metastases (BM) cause symptoms that supportive medications can alleviate. We assessed whether racial disparities exist in supportive medication utilization after BM diagnosis.Medicare-enrolled patients linked with the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program (SEER) who had diagnoses of BM between 2007 and 2016 were identified. Fourteen supportive medication classes were studied: non-opioid analgesics, opioids, anti-emetics, anti-epileptics, headache-targeting medications, steroids, cognitive aids, antidepressants, anxiolytics, antidelirium/antipsychotic agents, muscle relaxants, psychostimulants, sleep aids, and appetite stimulants. Drug administration ≤30 days following BM diagnosis was compared by race using multivariable logistic regression.Among 17,957 patients, headache aids, antidepressants, and anxiolytics were prescribed less frequently to African Americans (odds ratio [95% CI] = 0.81 [0.73-0.90], P < 0.001; OR = 0.68 [0.57-0.80], P < 0.001; and OR = 0.68 [0.56-0.82], P < 0.001, respectively), Hispanics (OR = 0.83 [0.73-0.94], P = 0.004 OR = 0.78 [0.64-0.97], P = 0.02; and OR = 0.63 [0.49-0.81], P < 0.001, respectively), and Asians (OR = 0.81 [0.72-0.92], P = 0.001, OR = 0.67 [0.53-0.85], P = 0.001, and OR = 0.62 [0.48-0.80], P < 0.001, respectively) compared with non-Hispanic Whites. African Americans also received fewer anti-emetics (OR = 0.75 [0.68-0.83], P < 0.001), steroids (OR = 0.84 [0.76-0.93], P < 0.001), psychostimulants (OR = 0.14 [0.03-0.59], P = 0.007), sleep aids (OR = 0.71 [0.61-0.83], P < 0.001), and appetite stimulants (OR = 0.85 [0.77-0.94], P = 0.002) than Whites. Hispanic patients less frequently received antidelirium/antipsychotic drugs (OR = 0.57 [0.38-0.86], P = 0.008), sleep aids (OR = 0.78 [0.64-0.94, P = 0.01), and appetite stimulants (OR = 0.87 [0.76-0.99], P = 0.04). Asian patients received fewer opioids (OR = 0.86 [0.75-0.99], P = 0.04), anti-emetics (OR = 0.83 [0.73-0.94], P = 0.004), anti-epileptics (OR = 0.83 [0.71-0.97], P = 0.02), steroids (OR = 0.81 [0.72-0.92], P = 0.001), muscle relaxants (OR = 0.60 [0.41-0.89], P = 0.01), and appetite stimulants (OR = 0.87 [0.76-0.99], P = 0.03). No medication class was prescribed significantly less frequently to Whites.Disparities in supportive medication prescription for non-White/Hispanic groups with BM exist; improved provider communication and engagement with at-risk patients is needed.1. Patients with BM commonly experience neurologic symptoms.2. Supportive medications improve quality of life among patients with BM.3. Non-White patients with BM receive fewer supportive medications than White patients.","['brain metastases', 'disparities', 'medications', 'pain', 'palliative care', 'race', 'supportive care']"
Leukocyte Telomere Length Is Not Reduced in Children and Adults with Cystic Fibrosis but Associates with Clinical Characteristics-A Cross-Sectional Study.,"We hypothezied that telomere length is considerably altered in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients compared to healthy subjects (HS), and that leukocyte telomere length variation reflects the severity of CF. Relative telomere length (RTL) was assessed by qPCR in 70 children aged 5-10 (34 CF; 36 HS) and 114 adults aged 18-45 (53 CF; 61 HS). Telomere length was similar in CF and HS (median (interquartile range): 0.799 (0.686-0.950) vs. 0.831 (0.707-0.986); <i>p</i> = 0.5283) both in children and adults. In adults, women had longer telomeres than men (0.805 (0.715-0.931) vs. 0.703 (0.574-0.790); <i>p</i> = 0.0002). Patients treated with inhaled corticosteroids had a shorter RTL compared to those without steroid therapy (0.765 (0.664-0.910) vs. 0.943 (0.813-1.191); <i>p</i> = 0.0007) and this finding remained significant after adjusting for gender, age, BMI, and child/adult status (<i>p</i> = 0.0003). Shorter telomeres were independently associated with the presence of comorbidities (0.763 (0.643-0.905) vs. 0.950 (0.783-1.130); <i>p</i> = 0.0006) and antibiotic treatment at the moment of blood sampling (0.762 (0.648-0.908) vs. 0.832 (0.748-1.129); <i>p</i> = 0.0172). RTL correlated with number of multiple-day hospitalizations (rho = -0.251; <i>p</i> = 0.0239), as well as number of hospitalization days (rho = -0.279; <i>p</i> = 0.0113). Leukocyte RTL in children and adults with CF was not shorter than in healthy controls, and did not seem to have any potential as a predictor of CF survival. However, it inversely associated with the investigated clinical characteristics.","['CFTR', 'Pseudomonas aeruginosa', 'dried blood spots', 'inhaled corticosteroids', 'pancreatic insufficiency']"
"Does doctors' personality differ from those of patients, the highly educated and other caring professions? An observational study using two nationally representative Australian surveys.","Personality differences between doctors and patients can affect treatment outcomes. We examine these trait disparities, as well as differences across medical specialities.Retrospective, observational statistical analysis of secondary data.Data from two data sets that are nationally representative of doctors and the general population in Australia.We include 23 358 individuals from a representative survey of the general Australian population (with subgroups of 18 705 patients, 1261 highly educated individuals and 5814 working in caring professions) as well as 19 351 doctors from a representative survey of doctors in Australia (with subgroups of 5844 general practitioners, 1776 person-oriented specialists and 3245 technique-oriented specialists).Big Five personality traits and locus of control.

Effect of <i>n</i>-3 (Omega-3) Polyunsaturated Fatty Acid Supplementation on Metabolic and Inflammatory Biomarkers and Body Weight in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of RCTs.,"Beneficial effects of <i>n</i>-3 fatty acids on metabolic biomarkers in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has been reported. The objectives of this current research were to investigate the effects of <i>n</i>-3 supplementation on metabolic factors, weight, and body mass index (BMI) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), using a meta-analysis of randomized, controlled trials (RCTs). Online databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Science Direct were searched until 2021 to identify eligible articles. Thirty trials were included. The results showed that <i>n</i>-3 consumption can significantly reduce glycemic factors including fasting blood sugar (FBS) (-0.36 (-0.71 to -0.01)), glycated hemoglobulin (HbA1c) (-0.74 (-1.13 to -0.35)), and homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA.IR) (-0.58 (-1.13 to -0.03)). Furthermore, significant improvement in lipid profile including triglycerides (TG) (-0.27 (-0.37 to -0.18)), total cholesterol (-0.60 (-0.88 to -0.32)), low density lipoprotein (LDL) (-0.54 (-0.85 to -0.23)), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (0.60 (0.23 to 0.96)) levels were found in the present meta-analysis. The reduction in the inflammatory marker's tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) (-0.13 (-0.75 to 0.48)) and c-reactive protein (CRP) (-0.72 (-1.70 to 0.27)), as well as weight (-0.09 (-0.24 to 0.07)) and BMI (-0.13 (-0.29 to 0.02)) were not statistically significant. Furthermore, the findings revealed that the optimal dose and duration of <i>n</i>-3 consumption for patients with T2DM is 1000-2000 mg/d for more than 8 weeks. The present meta-analysis and review reveals that <i>n</i>-3 supplementation can improve glycemic factors and lipid profile in patients with T2DM. Furthermore, <i>n</i>-3 supplementation may provide beneficial effects on inflammatory markers and body weight if used at the appropriate dose and duration.","['BMI', 'T2DM', 'diabetes', 'glycemic control', 'metaanalysis', 'metabolic and inflammatory biomarkers', 'n3', 'polyunsaturated fatty acids PUFA', 'randomized controlled trials RCTs', 'weight']"
Serum Albumin Before CRRT Was Associated With the 28- and 90-Day Mortality of Critically Ill Patients With Acute Kidney Injury and Treated With Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Although low serum albumin (ALB) may worsen acute kidney injury (AKI), additional study is needed to establish the connection between ALB and the prognosis of critically ill patients with AKI and treated with continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT). <b>Methods:</b>A secondary analysis of a bi-center, retrospective, and observational study, such as critically ill patients with AKI and treated with CRRT from January 2009 to September 2016. The univariate analysis, multi-factor regression analysis, sensitivity analysis, and curve-fitting analysis were applied to explore the association of ALB with the 28 and 90 days mortality of critically ill patients with AKI and treated with CRRT, and the removal efficiency of serum phosphorus. <b>Results:</b> From January 2009 to September 2016, 1,132 cases with AKI and treated with CRRT met the inclusion criteria and enrolled in this study. We found that the higher ALB before CRRT, the lower the 28- and 90-day mortality of patients with AKI and treated with CRRT, the higher removal efficiency of serum phosphorus, the adjusted hazard ratio (HR) value for 28-day mortality in the four models were separately 0.92 (0.90, 0.95), 0.91 (0.89, 0.94), 0.92 (0.89, 0.95), and 0.92 (0.89, 0.95); the adjusted HR value for 90 day mortality in the four models were 0.91 (0.89, 0.94), 0.92 (0.89, 0.95), 0.92 (0.89, 0.95), and 0.92 (0.89, 0.96); the adjusted OR value for the removal efficiency of serum phosphorus in the four models were separately -0.04 (-0.07, -0.01), -0.05 (-0.08, -0.01), -0.04 (-0.08, -0.01), and -0.04 (-0.08, -0.01). The sensitivity analysis and curve-fitting analysis also showed that ALB before CRRT was correlated with the 28 and 90 days mortality of critically ill patients with AKI and treated with CRRT and the removal efficiency of serum phosphorus. <b>Conclusion:</b> The higher the serum ALB before CRRT, the lower the mortality of critically ill patients with AKI and treated with CRRT, and the higher the clearance efficiency of serum phosphorus.","['28 and 90day mortality', 'acute kidney infusion', 'continuous renal replacement therapy', 'critically ill patients', 'serum albumin']"
Changes in aminoacidergic and monoaminergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus and amygdala of rats after ayahuasca ingestion.,"To evaluate changes in neurotransmission induced by a psychoactive beverage ayahuasca in the hippocampus and amygdala of naive rats.The level of monoamines, their main metabolites and amino acid neurotransmitters concentrations were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Four groups of rats were employed: saline-treated and rats receiving 250, 500 and 800 mg/kg of ayahuasca infusion (gavage). Animals were killed 40 min after drug ingestion and the structures stored at -80 °C until HPLC assay. The data from all groups were compared using Analysis of variance and Scheffé as post test and P < 0.05 was accepted as significant.The results showed decreased concentrations of glycine (GLY) (0.13 ± 0.03 vs 0.29 ± 0.07, P < 0.001) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (1.07 ± 0.14 vs 1.73 ± 0.25, P < 0.001) in the amygdala of rats that received 500 of ayahuasca. Animals that ingested 800 mg/kg of ayahuasca also showed a reduction of GLY level (0.11 ± 0.01 vs 0.29 ± 0.07, P < 0.001) and GABA (0.98 ± 0.06 vs 1.73 ± 0.25, P < 0.001). In the hippocampus, increased GABA levels were found in rats that received all ayahuasca doses: 250 mg/kg (1.29 ± 0.19 vs 0.84 ± 0.21, P < 0.05); 500 mg/kg (2.23 ± 038 vs 084 ± 0.21, P < 0.05) and 800 mg/kg (1.98 ± 0.92 vs 0.84 ± 0.21, P < 0.05). In addition, an increased utilization rate of all monoamines was found in the amygdala after ayahuasca administration in doses: 250 mg/kg (noradrenaline: 0.16 ± 0.02 vs 0.36 ± 0.06, P < 0.01; dopamine: 0.39 ± 0.012 vs 2.39 ± 0.84, P < 0.001; serotonin: 1.02 ± 0.22 vs 4.04 ± 0.91, P < 0.001), 500 mg/kg (noradrenaline: 0.08 ± 0.02 vs 0.36 ± 0.06, P < 0.001; dopamine: 0.33 ± 0.19 vs 2.39 ± 0.84, P < 0.001; serotonin: 0.59 ± 0.08 vs 4.04 ± 0.91, P < 0.001) and 800 mg/kg (noradrenaline: 0.16 ± 0.04 vs 0.36 ± 0.06, P < 0.001; dopamine: 0.84 ± 0.65 vs 2.39 ± 0.84, P < 0.05; serotonin: 0.36 ± 0.02 vs 4.04 ± 0.91, P < 0.001).Our data suggest increased release of inhibitory amino acids by the hippocampus and an increased utilization rate of monoamines by the amygdala after different doses of ayahuasca ingestion.","['Amino Acids', 'Amygdala', 'Ayahuasca', 'Hippocampus', 'Monoamines']"
Effects of exercise of different intensities on withdrawal symptoms among people with substance use disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"<b>Background:</b> Exercise can effectively attenuate withdrawal symptoms and reduce relapse, but it is unknown whether exercise of different intensities produces different results. This study aimed to systematically review the effects of different exercise intensities on withdrawal symptoms among people with substance use disorder (SUD). <b>Methods:</b> Systematic searches for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on exercise, SUD, and abstinence symptoms were conducted via electronic databases, including PubMed, up to June 2022. Study quality was evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool (RoB 2.0) for assessment of risk of bias in randomized trials. The meta-analysis was performed by calculating the standard mean difference (SMD) in outcomes of interventions involving light-, moderate-, and high-intensity exercise for each individual study using Review Manager version 5.3 (RevMan 5.3). <b>Results:</b> In total, 22 RCTs (<i>n</i> = 1,537) were included. Overall, exercise interventions had significant effects on withdrawal symptoms, but the effect size varied with exercise intensity and by outcome measure (i.e., for different negative emotions). Light-, moderate-, and high-intensity exercise reduced cravings after the intervention [SMD = -0.71, 95% CI = (-0.90, -0.52)], and there were no statistical differences between the subgroups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Light-, moderate-, and high-intensity exercise reduced depression after the intervention [light, SMD = -0.33, 95% CI = (-0.57, -0.09); moderate, SMD = -0.64, 95% CI = (-0.85, -0.42); high, SMD = -0.25, 95% CI = (-0.44, -0.05)], with moderate-intensity exercise producing the best effect (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Only light- and moderate-intensity exercise relieved anxiety after the intervention [light, SMD = -0.48, 95% CI = (-0.71, -0.26); moderate, SMD = -0.58, 95% CI = (-0.85, -0.31)]. Only high-intensity exercise worked in alleviating stress [SMD = -1.13, 95% CI = (-2.22, -0.04)]. Both irritability and restlessness could be improved by light- and moderate-intensity exercise [irritability, SMD = -0.74, 95% CI = (-0.98, -0.50); restless, SMD = -0.72, 95% CI = (-0.98, -0.47)], and there were no statistical differences between the subgroups (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Moderate- and high-intensity exercise decreased withdrawal syndrome after the intervention [moderate, SMD = -0.30, 95% CI = (-0.55, -0.05); high, SMD = -1.33, 95% CI = (-1.90, -0.76)], with high-intensity exercise producing the best effects (<i>p</i> < 0.01). <b>Conclusion:</b> Overall, exercise leads to improvements in withdrawal symptoms in individuals with SUD, but these effects vary significantly between the exercise of different intensities and according to the type of withdrawal symptoms. Moderate-intensity exercise has the greatest benefits in improving depression and anxiety; high-intensity exercise has the greatest benefits in improving withdrawal syndrome. <b>Systematic Review Registration:</b> www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier, CRD42022343791.","['exercise', 'intensity', 'metaanalysis', 'substance use disorder', 'withdrawal symptom']"
The hemorrhagic transformation index score: a prediction tool in middle cerebral artery ischemic stroke.,"We aimed to develop a tool, the hemorrhagic transformation (HT) index (HTI), to predict any HT within 14 days after middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke onset regardless of the intravenous recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (IV rtPA) use. That is especially important in the light of missing evidence-based data concerning the timing of anticoagulant resumption after stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).We retrospectively analyzed 783 consecutive MCA stroke patients. Clinical and brain imaging data at admission were recorded. A follow-up period was 2 weeks after admission. The patients were divided into derivation (DC) and validation (VC) cohorts by generating Bernoulli variates with probability parameter 0.7. Univariate/multivariate logistic regression, and factor analysis were used to extract independent predictors. Validation was performed with internal consistency reliability and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Bootstrapping was used to reduce bias.The HTI was composed of 4 items: Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score (ASPECTS), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), hyperdense MCA (HMCA) sign, and AF on electrocardiogram (ECG) at admission. According to the predicted probability (PP) range, scores were allocated to ASPECTS as follows: 10-7 = 0; 6-5 = 1; 4-3 = 2; 2-0 = 3; to NIHSS: 0-11 = 0; 12-17 = 1; 18-23 = 2; >23 = 3; to HMCA sign: yes = 1; to AF on ECG: yes = 1. The HTI score varied from 0 to 8. For each score, adjusted PP of any HT with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was as follows: 0 = 0.027 (0.011-0.042); 1 = 0.07 (0.043-0.098); 2 = 0.169 (0.125-0.213); 3 = 0.346 (0.275-0.417); 4 = 0.571 (0.474-0.668); 5 = 0.768 (0.676-0.861); 6 = 0.893 (0.829-0.957); 7 = 0.956 (0.92-0.992); 8 = 0.983 (0.965-1.0). The optimal cutpoint score to differentiate between HT-positive and negative groups was 2 (95% normal-based CI, 1-3) for the DC and VC alike. ROC area/sensitivity/specificity with 95% normal-based CI for the DC and VC were 0.85 (0.82-0.89)/0.82 (0.73-0.9)/0.89 (0.8-0.97) and 0.83 (0.78-0.88)/0.8 (0.66-0.94)/0.87 (0.73-1.0) respectively. McDonald's categorical omega with 95% bias-corrected and accelerated CI for the DC and VC was 0.81 (0.77-0.84) and 0.82 (0.76-0.86) respectively.The HTI is a simple yet reliable tool to predict any HT within 2 weeks after MCA stroke onset regardless of the IV rtPA use.","['Complication', 'Hemorrhage', 'Hemorrhagic transformation', 'Middle cerebral artery', 'Prognosis', 'Stroke']"
Exploring the factors behind the shift in unwanted childbearing rate in Bangladesh between 2007 and 2017/2018: a cross-sectional study.,"This study aimed at exploring the factors associated with the reduction in the proportion of women reporting unwanted births in Bangladesh between 2007 and 2017/2018.A cross-sectional analysis of the data collected by the 2007 and 2017/2018 Bangladesh Demographic and Health Surveys by using a two-stage stratified sampling covering the entire population in Bangladesh.Our analysis included 4810 (2007) and 7403 (2017/2018) weighted ever-married women aged 15-49 years reporting at least one birth in the 5 years preceding each of the surveys.The proportion of women reporting unwanted births declined by 26.2% between 2007 and 2017/2018. Overall changes in women's behaviour and their proportions with distinct characteristics explained 66.2% (0.051 points decrease, 95% CI -0.071 to -0.031, p<0.001) and 45.5% (0.035 points decrease, 95% CI -0.051 to -0.019, p<0.001) of the overall reduction in the proportion reporting unwanted births, respectively. Behavioural changes among those being visited by family planning (FP) workers (0.004 points decrease, 95% CI -0.008 to -0.000, p=0.047), having complete secondary education or higher (0.009 points decrease, 95% CI -0.016 to -0.003, p=0.002), and earning in kind (0.002 points decrease, 95% CI -0.005 to -0.000, p=0.035) were associated with a reduction in unwanted childbearing. Increases in the proportions of women married at age 18 or older (0.008 points decrease, 95% CI -0.010 to -0.005, p<0.001), and having some secondary education (0.013 points decrease, 95% CI -0.019 to -0.008, p<0.001) were negatively associated with unwanted childbearing. Conversely, an increase in the proportion expressing preference for a balanced sex composition of the family was positively associated with unwanted childbearing (0.013 points increase, 95% CI 0.008 to 0.017, p<0.001).Women's behavioural changes driven by the FP programmes and other external factors, and changes in their characteristics, could reduce the incidence of unwanted childbearing in Bangladesh, and thereby contribute to improvements in maternal health.","['Demography', 'Health policy', 'PUBLIC HEALTH']"
Assessment of autonomous nerve system through non-linear heart rate variability outcomes in sedentary healthy adults.,"Heart rate variability (HRV) is a psycho-physiological phenomenon with broad health implications. Different data analysis methods have been used to assess the autonomic nervous system activity, but the validation of new indexes that accurately describe its balance through non-invasive methods (i.e., HRV analysis) is of clinical interest. This study aimed: (i) to evaluate the association of the Stress Score (SS) and the Sympathetic/Parasympathetic Ratio (S/PS) with time domain and frequency domain analysis of HRV, and (ii) to set reference values of SS and S/PS in sedentary healthy adults.A total of 156 sedentary healthy adults (38.4 ± 15.57 years old, 81 women), aged were involved in this study. HRV was measured for 15 min in a supine position at rest. SS and S/PS were calculated from the non-linear HRV analyses based on Poincare Plot.Stress Score showed a non-linear negative power-law relationship with SDNN (β = -0.969; <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.963; <i>P</i> < 0.001), RMSSD (β = -0.867; <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.722; <i>P</i> < 0.001), high frequency (β = -0.834; <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.752; <i>P</i> =< 0.001), low frequency (β = -0.627; <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.330; <i>P</i> < 0.001), SD1 (β = -0.867; <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.722; <i>P</i> < 0.001) and SD2 (β = -1.000; <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> > 0.999; <i>P</i> < 0.001). There was observed a negative cubic relationship between SS with PNN50 (β = -1.972; <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.644; <i>P</i> < 0.001). A linear regression model was conducted between SS with Ratio Low/High Frequency (β = 0.026; <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> < 0.001; <i>P</i> = 0.750). Non-linear power-law regression models were built between S/PS and SDNN (β = -0.990; <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.981; <i>P</i> < 0.001), RMSSD (β = -0.973; <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.939; <i>P</i> < 0.001), high frequency (β = -0.928; <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.970; <i>P</i> < 0.001), low frequency (β = -2.344; <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.557; <i>P</i> < 0.001), SD1 (β = -0.973; <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.939; <i>P</i> < 0.001) and SD2 (β = -0.611; <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.908; <i>P</i> < 0.001). A non-linear negative regression model was built between S/PS and PNN50 (β = -3.412; <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.868; <i>P</i> < 0.001). A linear regression model was conducted between S/PS and SD2/SD1 (β = 0.075; <i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.006; <i>P</i> < 0.001).Our results support the use of SS as a sympathetic activity marker, and S/PS as an indicator of the sympathetic and parasympathetic activity of the autonomic nervous system in sedentary healthy adults.","['HRV', 'Kubios', 'Poincare plot', 'Stress score', 'Sympatheticparasympathetic ratio']"
Uniportal versus three-port video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery for spontaneous pneumothorax: a meta-analysis.,"Whether or not uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is beneficial for spontaneous pneumothorax remains inconclusive. This meta-analysis aimed to summarize the available evidence to assess the feasibility and advantages of uniportal VATS for the treatment of spontaneous pneumothorax compared with three-port VATS.Eligible publications were identified by searching the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data databases and CQVIP. Odds ratios (OR) and standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated to compare dichotomous and continuous variables, respectively.This meta-analysis was based on 17 studies and included a total of 988 patients with spontaneous pneumothorax. No death was reported during the perioperative period. Compared with three-port VATS groups, there was a statistically significant difference in uniportal VATS groups regarding postoperative hospital stay (SMD= -0.58; 95% CI: -1.04 to -0.12; P=0.01), paresthesia (OR=0.13; 95% CI: 0.07 to 0.24; P<0.00001), visual analogue pain score (VAS) at 24 hours (h) (SMD= -0.87; 95% CI: -1.07 to -0.68; P<0.00001), VAS at 72 h (SMD= -0.49; 95% CI: -0.68 to -0.30; P<0.00001), and patients satisfaction scale (PSS) at 24 h (SMD= -0.81; 95% CI: -1.21 to -0.41; P<0.0001), PSS at 48 h (SMD= -0.69; 95% CI: -1.08 to -0.29; P=0.0007). However there was no statistically significant difference on the recurrence (OR=0.79; 95% CI: 0.42 to 1.46; P=0.45), operative time (SMD= -0.23; 95% CI: -0.21 to 0.67; P=0.31), length of postoperative drainage (SMD= -0.17; 95% CI: -0.40 to -0.07; P=0.16), VAS at 48 h (SMD= -0.40; 95% CI: -1.47 to 0.67; P=0.46), and PSS at 72 h (SMD= -0.13; 95% CI: -0.52 to -0.25; P=0.50).The results for mortality, recurrence, operative time, and length of postoperative drainage were similar between uniportal and three-port VATS. Uniportal VATS resulted in reduction in postoperative pain and paresthesia as well as an improvement in patients' satisfaction. This meta-analysis indicated that using uniportal VATS to treat spontaneous pneumothorax was safe and feasible, and it may be a better alternative procedure because of its advantage in reducing postoperative pain and paresthesia.","['Uniportal', 'metaanalysis', 'spontaneous pneumothorax', 'threeport surgery', 'videoassisted thoracoscopic surgery VATS']"
Comparison of artificial intelligence <i>vs.</i> junior dentists' diagnostic performance based on caries and periapical infection detection on panoramic images.,"There is information missing in the literature about the comparison of dentists <i>vs.</i> artificial intelligence (AI) based on diagnostic capability. The aim of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance based on radiological diagnoses regarding caries and periapical infection detection by comparing AI software with junior dentists who have 1 or 2 years of experience, based on the valid determinations by specialist dentists.In the initial stage of the study, 2 specialist dentists evaluated the presence of caries and periapical lesions on 500 digital panoramic radiographs, and the detection time was recorded in seconds. In the second stage, 3 junior dentists and an AI software performed diagnoses on the same panoramic radiographs, and the diagnostic results and durations were recorded in seconds.The AI and the three junior dentists, respectively, detected dental caries at a sensitivity (SEN) of 0.907, 0.889, 0.491, 0.907; a specificity (SPEC) of 0.760, 0.740, 0.454, 0.696; a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.693, 0.470, 0.155, 0.666; a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.505, 0.415, 0.275, 0.367 and a F1-score of 0.786, 0.615, 0.236, 0.768. The AI and the three junior dentists respectively detected periapical lesions at an SEN of 0.973, 0.962, 0.758, 0.958; a SPEC of 0.629, 0.421, 0.404, 0.621; a PPV of 0.861, 0.651, 0.312, 0.648; a NPV of 0.689, 0.673, 0.278, 0.546 and an F1-score of 0.914, 0.777, 0.442, 0.773. The AI software gave more accurate results, especially in detecting periapical lesions. On the other hand, in caries detection, the underdiagnosis rate was high for both AI and junior dentists.Regarding the evaluation time needed, AI performed faster, on average.","['Dental radiology', 'artificial intelligence AI', 'caries', 'diagnosis', 'infection']"
"Vitamin D Supplementation, Serum 25(OH)D Concentrations and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","<b>Background:</b> Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors are associated with low serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D) concentrations in observational studies; however, clinical trial findings are inconsistent. <b>Objective:</b> We assessed the effect of vitamin D supplementation and increased serum 25(OH)D concentrations on CVD risk factors in a systemic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs). <b>Design:</b> MEDLINE, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Google Scholar were searched for RCTs that evaluated vitamin D supplementation and cardiovascular outcomes [blood pressure, parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), total cholesterol, high and low density lipoprotein (HDL and LDL, respectively), triglycerides, peak wave velocity (PWV) and Augmentation Index (AI)] from 1992 through 2017. Meta-analysis was based on a random-effects model and inverse variance method to calculate standardized mean difference (SMD) as effect sizes, followed by a leave-one-out method for sensitivity analysis. Risk of publication bias was assessed using Cochrane checklist and Begg funnel plots. The systematic review is registered as CRD42015025346. <b>Results:</b> We identified 2341 studies from which 81 met inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis indicated a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure (SMD = -0.102 ± 0.04 mmHg, 95% confidence interval (CI), -0.20 to -0.03), diastolic blood pressure (SMD = -0.07 ± 0.03 mmHg, 95% CI, -0.14 to -0.006), serum PTH (SMD = -0.66 ± 0.08 ng/L, 95% CI, -0.82 to -0.49), hs-CRP (SMD = -0.20 ± 0.07 mg/L, 95% CI, -0.34 to -0.06), total cholesterol (SMD = -0.15 ± 0.06 mmol/L, 95% CI, -0.25 to -0.04), LDL (SMD = -0.10 ± 0.05 mmol/L, 95% CI, -0.20 to -0.003), triglycerides (SMD = -0.12 ± 0.06 mmol/L, 95% CI, -0.23 to -0.003) and a significant increase in HDL (SMD = 0.09 ± 0.04 mmol/L, 95% CI, 0.00 to 0.17) with vitamin D supplementation. These findings remained significant in sensitivity analyses for blood pressure, lipid profile, serum PTH, and serum hs-CRP. There was no significant effect of vitamin D supplementation on PWV (SMD = -0.20 ± 0.13 m/s, 95% CI, -0.46 to 0.06, <i>p</i> = 0.14) and AI (SMD = -0.09 ± 0.14%, 95% CI, -0.37 to 0.19, <i>p</i> = 0.52) for vitamin D supplemented groups. <b>Conclusion:</b> These findings suggest that vitamin D supplementation may act to protect against CVD through improving risk factors, including high blood pressure, elevated PTH, dyslipidemia, and inflammation.","['arterial stiffness', 'blood pressure', 'cardiovascular', 'inflammation', 'lipids', 'metaanalysis', 'parathyroid hormone', 'vitamin D']"
A Study on the Psychological Factors Affecting the Quality of Life Among Ovarian Cancer Patients in China.,"We aim to test whether resilience mediates the association of fear of progression (FoP) with quality of life (QoL) among ovarian cancer patients in China.We collected 230 questionnaires from the First Affiliated Hospital of China Medical University in Liaoning Province, and 209 completed the questionnaire survey. The survey instrument consisted of four questionnaires: a sociodemographic and clinical characteristics questionnaire, the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy general instrument, the Fear of Progression Questionnaire-Short Form and the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale. Hierarchical regression analysis was used to examine the relationship among FoP, resilience, and QoL, including physical well-being, social well-being, emotional well-being, and functional well-being. We used asymptotic and resampling strategies to examine the indirect effect of resilience.FoP was negatively associated with resilience (<i>r</i>=-0.543, <i>P</i><0.01) and QoL (physical well-being: <i>r</i>=-0.537, <i>P</i><0.01; social well-being: <i>r</i>=-0.426, <i>P</i><0.01; emotional well-being: <i>r</i>=-0.487, <i>P</i><0.01; functional well-being: <i>r</i>=-0.529, <i>P</i><0.01). Resilience was positively related with QoL (physical well-being: <i>r</i>=0.449, <i>P</i><0.01; social well-being: <i>r</i>=0.548, <i>P</i><0.01; emotional well-being: <i>r</i>=0.430, <i>P</i><0.01; functional well-being: <i>r</i>=0.655, <i>P</i><0.01). Resilience partly mediated the association between FoP and physical well-being (a×b=-0.05, BCa 95% CI: -0.09, -0.02), social well-being (a×b=-0.21, BCa 95% CI: -0.29, -0.14), emotional well-being (a×b=-0.05, BCa 95% CI: -0.08, -0.02), and functional well-being (a×b=-0.24, BCa 95% CI: -0.32, -0.17). The proportion of the mediating effect accounted for by resilience were 22.57%, 57.22%, 26.02%, 53.42% for physical well-being, social well-being, emotional well-being and functional well-being, respectively.The study showed that resilience could mediate the association between fear of progression and quality of life. It suggests that resilience might provide a potential target for intervention in quality of life with ovarian cancer.","['fear of progression', 'mediating role', 'ovarian cancer patients', 'quality of life', 'resilience']"
Improving performance and generalizability in radiogenomics: a pilot study for prediction of IDH1/2 mutation status in gliomas with multicentric data.,"<b>Purpose:</b> Radiogenomics offers a potential virtual and noninvasive biopsy. However, radiogenomics models often suffer from generalizability issues, which cause a performance degradation on unseen data. In MRI, differences in the sequence parameters, manufacturers, and scanners make this generalizability issue worse. Such image acquisition information may be used to define different environments and select robust and invariant radiomic features associated with the clinical outcome that should be included in radiomics/radiogenomics models. <b>Approach:</b> We assessed 77 low-grade gliomas and glioblastomas multiform patients publicly available in TCGA and TCIA. Radiomics features were extracted from multiparametric MRI images (T1-weighted, contrast-enhanced T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) and different regions-of-interest (enhancing tumor, nonenhancing tumor/necrosis, and edema). A method developed to find variables that are part of causal structures was used for feature selection and compared with an embedded feature selection approach commonly used in radiomics/radiogenomics studies, across two different scenarios: (1) leaving data from a center as an independent held-out test set and tuning the model with the data from the remaining centers and (2) use stratified partitioning to obtain the training and the held-out test sets. <b>Results:</b> In scenario (1), the performance of the proposed methodology and the traditional embedded method was AUC: 0.75 [0.25; 1.00] versus 0.83 [0.50; 1.00], Sens.: 0.67 [0.20; 0.93] versus 0.67 [0.20; 0.93], Spec.: 0.75 [0.30; 0.95] versus 0.75 [0.30; 0.95], and MCC: 0.42 [0.19; 0.68] versus 0.42 [0.19; 0.68] for center 1 as the held-out test set. The performance of both methods for center 2 as the held-out test set was AUC: 0.64 [0.36; 0.91] versus 0.55 [0.27; 0.82], Sens.: 0.00 [0.00; 0.73] versus 0.00 [0.00; 0.73], Spec.: 0.82 [0.52; 0.94] versus 0.91 [0.62; 0.98], and MCC: <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mo>-</mo> <mn>0.13</mn></mrow> </math> <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mo>[</mo> <mo>-</mo> <mn>0.38</mn> <mo>;</mo> <mo>-</mo> <mn>0.04</mn> <mo>]</mo></mrow> </math> versus <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mo>-</mo> <mn>0.09</mn></mrow> </math> <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><mrow><mo>[</mo> <mo>-</mo> <mn>0.38</mn> <mo>;</mo> <mo>-</mo> <mn>0.02</mn> <mo>]</mo></mrow> </math> , whereas for center 3 was AUC: 0.80 [0.62; 0.95] versus 0.89 [0.56; 0.96], Sens.: 0.86 [0.48; 0.97] versus 0.86 [0.48; 0.97], Spec.: 0.72 [0.54; 0.85] versus 0.79 [0.61; 0.90], and MCC: 0.47 [0.41; 0.53] versus 0.55 [0.48; 0.60].

"Protection of homologous and heterologous boosters after primary schemes of rAd26-rAd5, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BBIBP-CorV during the omicron outbreak in adults of 50 years and older in Argentina: a test-negative case-control study.","After primary vaccination schemes with rAd26-rAd5 (Sputnik V), ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, BBIBP-CorV or heterologous combinations, the effectiveness of homologous or heterologous boosters (Sputnik V, ChAdOx, Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna) against SARS-CoV-2 infections, hospitalisations and deaths has been scarcely studied.Test-negative, case-control study, conducted in Argentina during omicron BA.1 predominance, in adults ≥50 years old tested for SARS-CoV-2 who had received two or three doses of COVID-19 vaccines. Outcomes were COVID-associated infections, hospitalisations and deaths after administering mRNA and vectored boosters, < or ≥60 days from the last dose.Of 422,124 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, 221,993 (52.5%) tested positive; 190,884 (45.2%) and 231,260 (54.8%) had received 2-dose and 3-dose vaccination schemes, respectively. The 3-dose scheme reduced infections, hospitalisations and death (OR 0.81 [0.80-0.83]; 0.28 [0.25-0.32] and 0.25 [0.22-0.28] respectively), but protection dropped after 60 days to 1.04 [1.01-1.06]; 0.52 [0.44-0.61] and 0.38 [0.33-0.45]). Compared with 2-dose-schemes, homologous boosters after primary schemes with vectored-vaccines provided lower protection against infections < and ≥60 days (0.94 [0.92-0.97] and 1.05 [1.01-1.09], respectively) but protected against hospitalisations (0.30 [0.26-0.35]) and deaths (0.29 [0.25-0.33]), decreasing after 60 days (0.59 [0.47-0.74] and 0.51 [0.41-0.64], respectively). Heterologous boosters protected against infections (0.70 [0.68-0.71]) but decreased after 60 days (1.01 [0.98-1.04]) and against hospitalisations and deaths (0.26 [0.22-0.31] and 0.22 [0.18-0.25], respectively), which also decreased after 60 days (0.43 [0.35-0.53] and 0.33 [0.26-0.41], respectively). Heterologous boosters protected against infections when applied <60 days (0.70 [0.68-0.71], p < 0.001), against hospitalisations when applied ≥60 days (0.43 [0.35-0.53], p < 0.01), and against deaths < and ≥60 days (0.22 [0.18-0.25], p < 0.01 and 0.33 [0.26-0.41], p < 0.001).During omicron predominance, heterologous boosters such as viral vectored and mRNA vaccines, following Sputnik V, ChAdOx1, Sinopharm or heterologous primary schemes might provide better protection against death; this effect might last longer in individuals aged ≥50 than homologous boosters.None.",['Vaccination']
Haloperidol versus Second-generation Antipsychotics on the cognitive performance of individuals with schizophrenia and related disorders: pairwise meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Despite previous literature, the superiority of Second-generation Antipsychotics (SGAs) relative to First-generation Antipsychotics- especially haloperidol - on cognitive management in schizophrenia is still controversial. Thus, we aimed to compare the effects of haloperidol versus SGAs on the cognitive performance of individuals with schizophrenia or related disorders.We conducted an updated systematic review and nine pairwise meta-analyses of double-blinded randomized controlled trials published up to October 30th, 2022, using Medline, Web of Science, and Embase.Twenty-eight trials were included, enrolling 1,932 individuals. Compared to SGAs, haloperidol performed worse on cognitive composite (MD -0.13; 95% CI: -0.33 to -0.03; MD = mean difference, CI = confidence interval), processing speed (MD -0.17; 95% CI: -0.28 to -0.07), attention (MD -0.14; 95% CI: -0.26 to -0.02), motor performance (MD -0.17; 95% CI: -0.31 to -0.03), memory and verbal learning (MD -0.21; 95% CI: -0.35 to -0.08), and executive function (MD -0.27; 95% CI: -0.43 to -0.11). In contrast, there were no significant differences between SGAs and haloperidol on working memory (MD 0.10; 95% CI: -0.08 to 0.27), visual learning (MD 0.08; 95% CI: -0.05 to 0.21), social cognition (MD 0.29; 95% CI: -0.30 to 0.88), and visuoconstruction (MD 0.17; 95% CI: -0.04 to 0.39).Haloperidol had poorer performance in global cognition and in some cognitive domains, but with small effect sizes. Therefore, it was not possible to conclude that haloperidol is certainly worse than SGAs in the long-term cognitive management of schizophrenia.","['Cognition', 'antipsychotics', 'haloperidol', 'metaanalysis', 'schizophrenia']"
Myopia control utilizing low-dose atropine as an isolated therapy or in combination with other optical measures: A retrospective cohort study.,"To assess the additive potency of low-dose atropine combined with optical measures designed to decrease myopia progression.This retrospective study included 104 myopic children aged 5-12 over 4 years, divided into five groups: daily instillation of 0.01% atropine and distance single-vision spectacles (A), 0.01% atropine and progressive addition lenses (A + PAL), 0.01% atropine and soft contact lens with peripheral blur (A + CL). Two control groups were included, prescribed bifocal spectacles or single vision (SV) spectacles. Cycloplegic spherical equivalence refraction was measured biannually, including 1 year after cessation of treatment.A significant decrease in myopia progression was noted during the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> years of atropine treatment: A -0.55 ± 0.55D, -0.15 ± 0.15, -0.12 ± 0.12D were 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> years, respectively, A + PAL -0.47 ± 0.37D, -0.10 ± 0.25D, and -0.11 ± 0.25D were 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> years, respectively, A + CL -0.36 ± 0.43D, -0.13 ± 0.29D, and -0.10 ± 0.27D were 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, 3<sup>rd</sup> years, respectively. Myopia progression over 3 years, respectively, was -0.82 ± 0.50D, -0.70 ± 0.69D, -0.59 ± 0.66D in the bifocal group and -1.20 ± 1.28D, -0.72 ± 0.62D, -0.65 ± 0.47D in the SV group. One year after cessation of atropine treatment, myopia progression was - 0.32 ± 0.31D in A, -0.23 ± 0.28D in A + PAL, and -0.18 ± 0.35D in A + CL.Atropine 0.01% presented as effective at decelerating myopia progression, more prominent in the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> years of treatment. Combining atropine 0.01% with optical modalities exhibited a trend for added efficacy over monotherapy. A + CL exhibited the least rebound effect 1 year after cessation of treatment.","['Atropine', 'myopia', 'myopia control', 'myopia progression']"
Predicting Mechanical Complications After Adult Spinal Deformity Operation Using a Machine Learning Based on Modified Global Alignment and Proportion Scoring With Body Mass Index and Bone Mineral Density.,"This study aimed to create an ideal machine learning model to predict mechanical complications in adult spinal deformity (ASD) surgery based on GAPB (modified global alignment and proportion scoring with body mass index and bone mineral density) factors.Between January 2009 and December 2018, 238 consecutive patients with ASD, who received at least 4-level fusions and were followed-up for ≥ 2 years, were included in the study. The data were stratified into training (n = 167, 70%) and test (n = 71, 30%) sets and input to machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, random forest gradient boosting system, and deep neural network.Body mass index, bone mineral density, the relative pelvic version score, the relative lumbar lordosis score, and the relative sagittal alignment score of the global alignment and proportion score were significantly different in the training and test sets (p < 0.05) between the complication and no complication groups. In the training set, the area under receiver operating characteristics (AUROCs) for logistic regression, gradient boosting, random forest, and deep neural network were 0.871 (0.817-0.925), 0.942 (0.911-0.974), 1.000 (1.000-1.000), and 0.947 (0.915-0.980), respectively, and the accuracies were 0.784 (0.722-0.847), 0.868 (0.817-0.920), 1.000 (1.000-1.000), and 0.856 (0.803-0.909), respectively. In the test set, the AUROCs were 0.785 (0.678-0.893), 0.808 (0.702-0.914), 0.810 (0.710-0.910), and 0.730 (0.610-0.850), respectively, and the accuracies were 0.732 (0.629-0.835), 0.718 (0.614-0.823), 0.732 (0.629-0.835), and 0.620 (0.507-0.733), respectively. The random forest achieved the best predictive performance on the training and test dataset.This study created a comprehensive model to predict mechanical complications after ASD surgery. The best prediction accuracy was 73.2% for predicting mechanical complications after ASD surgery.","['Adult spinal deformity', 'Body mass index', 'Bone mineral density', 'Machine learning', 'Mechanical complication', 'Random forest']"
"Diagnostic accuracy of grayscale, power Doppler and contrast-enhanced ultrasound compared with contrast-enhanced MRI in the visualization of synovitis in knee osteoarthritis.","To assess the diagnostic accuracy of grayscale (GSUS), power Doppler (PDUS) and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) for detecting synovitis in knee osteoarthritis (OA).Patients with different degrees of radiographic knee OA were included prospectively. All underwent GSUS, PDUS, CEUS, and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI), on which synovitis was assessed semi-quantitatively. Correlations of synovitis severity on ultrasound based techniques with CE-MRI were determined. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to assess diagnostic performance of GSUS, PDUS, and CEUS, for detecting synovitis, using CE-MRI as reference-standard.In the 31 patients included, synovitis scoring on GSUS and CEUS was significantly correlated (ρ = 0.608, p < 0.001 and ρ = 0.391, p = 0.033) with CE-MRI. For detecting mild synovitis, the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.781 (95 %CI 0.609-0.953) for GSUS, 0.788 (0.622-0.954) for PDUS, and 0.653 (0.452-0.853) for CEUS. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.667 (0.431-0.845) and 0.700 (0.354-0.919) for GSUS, 0.905 (0.682-0.983) and 0.500 (0.201-0.799) for PDUS, and 0.550 (0.320-0.762) and 0.700 (0.354-0.919) for CEUS, respectively. The AUC of GSUS increased to 0.862 (0.735-0.989), 0.823 (0.666-0.979), and 0.885 (0.767-1.000), when combined with PDUS, CEUS, or both, respectively. For detecting moderate synovitis, the AUC of GSUS was higher (0.882 (0.750-1.000)) and no added value of PDUS and CEUS was observed.GSUS has limited overall accuracy for detecting synovitis in knee OA. When GSUS is combined with PDUS or CEUS, overall diagnostic performance improves for detecting mild synovitis, but not for moderate synovitis.","['Inflammation', 'Knee', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Osteoarthritis', 'Synovitis', 'Ultrasonography']"
Comparison of Short-Term Outcomes between Button-Type Bipolar Plasma Vaporization and Transurethral Resection for the Prostate: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"<b>Background:</b> Previous meta-analysis evaluated a limited number of parameters regarding the comparison of BTPV and TURP for BPH. <b>Method:</b> PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for literature comparing BTPV with TURP. Data of efficacy (IPSS, Qmax, PVR and QoL) and safety were extracted and evaluated using either SMD or OR with 95% CI. All analyses were performed by RevMan 5.3. <b>Results:</b> Eleven trials with 1690 patients were selected. Compare to BTPV, TURP had better 6-month IPSS (SMD=0.36, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.63), better 1- (SMD=-0.38, 95% CI -0.63 to -0.12), 6- (SMD=-0.73, 95% CI -0.99 to -0.46) and 12-month Qmax (SMD=-0.47, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.10), better 6-month PVR (SMD=1.18, 95% CI 0.87 to 1.48), as well as better 3- (SMD=-0.24, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.01) and 6-month QoL (SMD=-0.62, 95% CI -0.91 to -0.33). However, BTPV had shorter catheterization time (SMD=-0.96, 95% CI -1.12 to -0.79) and hospital stay (SMD=-0.71, 95% CI -0.89 to -0.53), less hemoglobin decrease (SMD=-1.09, 95% CI -1.27 to -0.91) and virtually shorter operation time (SMD=-0.15, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.01). Moreover, BTPV had fewer occurrence of overall complications (OR=0.52, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.69), Clavien III-IV complications (OR=0.61, 95% CI 0.37 to 1.02), blood transfusion (OR=0.25, 95% CI 0.09 to 0.69), hematuria (OR=0.27, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.56) and capsular perforation (OR=0.19, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.48). Subgroup analysis indicated BTPV and bipolar TURP had similar total complications (OR 1.08, 95% CI 0.40-2.88, P=0.88) and Clavien III-IV complications (OR 1.42, 95% CI 0.36-5.57, P=0.61) and blood transfusion rate (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.04-1.73, P=0.17). <b>Conclusion:</b> Both TURP and BTPV could significantly improve IPPS, Qmax, PVR and QoL. TURP had slightly better short-term efficacy, while BTPV had better safety. However, subgroup analysis found bipolar TURP and BTPV had similar safety.","['benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH', 'buttontype bipolar plasma vaporization BTPV', 'lower urinary tract symptoms LUTS', 'transurethral resection TURP']"
"Efficacy, safety, predictability, aberrations and corneal biomechnical parameters after SMILE and FLEx: Meta-analysis.","To identify possible differences of efficacy, safety, predictability, higher-order aberrations and corneal biomechnical parameters after small-incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and femtosecond lenticule extraction (FLEx).A systematic literature retrieval was conducted in Medline, Embase and the Cochrane Library, up to October, 2015. The included studies were subject to a Meta-analysis. Comparison between SMILE and FLEx was measured as pooled odds ratio (OR) or weighted mean differences (WMD). Of 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to analyze data.A total of seven studies were included. Firstly, there were no differences in uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) 20/20 or better (OR, 1.37; 95% CI, 0.69 to 2.69; P=0.37) and logMAR UDVA (WMD, -0.02; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.01; P=0.17) after SMILE versus FLEx. We found no differences in corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) unchanged (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.46 to 2.11; P=0.97) and logMAR CDVA (WMD, -0.00; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.01; P=0.90) either. Secondly, we found no differences in refraction within ±1.00 D (OR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.13 to 7.28; P=0.99) and ±0.50 D (OR, 1.62; 95% CI, 0.62 to 4.28; P=0.33) of target postoperatively. Thirdly, for higher-order aberrations, we found no differences in the total higher-order aberrations (WMD, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.09 to 0.01; P=0.14), coma (WMD, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.09 to 0.01; P=0.11), spherical (WMD, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.03; P=0.60) and trefoil (WMD, -0.00; 95% CI, -0.04 to 0.03; P=0.76). Furthermore, for corneal biomechanical parameters, we also found no differences (WMD, 0.08; 95% CI, -0.17 to 0.33; P=0.54) after SMILE versus FLEx.There are no statistically differences in efficacy, safety, predictability, higher-order aberrations and corneal biomechnical parameters postoperative between SMILE and FLEx.","['aberrations', 'corneal biomechnical parameters', 'femtosecond lenticule extraction', 'smallincision lenticule extraction', 'visual quality']"
Melatonin attenuates acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury in rats by modulating interleukin 22.,"To investigate whether therapeutic treatment with melatonin could protect rats against acute pancreatitis and its associated lung injury.Seventy-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into three groups: the sham operation (SO), severe acute pancreatitis (SAP), and melatonin treatment (MT) groups. Acute pancreatitis was induced by infusion of 1 mL/kg of sodium taurocholate (4% solution) into the biliopancreatic duct. Melatonin (50 mg/kg) was administered 30 min before pancreatitis was induced, and the severity of pancreatic and pulmonary injuries was evaluated 1, 4 and 8 h after induction. Serum samples were collected to measure amylase activities, and lung tissues were removed to measure levels of mRNAs encoding interleukin 22 (IL-22) and T helper cell 22 (Th22), as well as levels of IL-22.At each time point, levels of mRNAs encoding IL-22 and Th22 were significantly higher (P < 0.001) in the MT group than in the SAP group (0.526 ± 0.143 vs 0.156 ± 0.027, respectively, here and throughout, after 1 h; 0.489 ± 0.150 vs 0.113 ± 0.014 after 4 h; 0.524 ± 0.168 vs 0.069 ± 0.013 after 8 h, 0.378 ± 0.134 vs 0.122 ± 0.015 after 1 h; 0.205 ± 0.041 vs 0.076 ± 0.019 after 4 h; 0.302 ± 0.108 vs 0.045 ± 0.013 after 8 h, respectively) and significantly lower (P < 0.001) in the SAP group than in the SO group (0.156 ± 0.027 vs 1.000 ± 0.010 after 1 h; 0.113 ± 0.014 vs 1.041 ± 0.235 after 4 h; 0.069 ± 0.013 vs 1.110 ± 0.213 after 8 h, 0.122 ± 0.015 vs 1.000 ± 0.188 after 1 h; 0.076 ± 0.019 vs 0.899 ± 0.125 after 4 h; 0.045 ± 0.013 vs 0.991 ± 0.222 after 8 h, respectively). The mean pathological scores for pancreatic tissues in the MT group were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than those for samples in the SO group (1.088 ± 0.187 vs 0.488 ± 0.183 after 1 h; 2.450 ± 0.212 vs 0.469 ± 0.242 after 4 h; 4.994 ± 0.184 vs 0.513 ± 0.210 after 8 h), but were significantly lower (P < 0.01) than those for samples in the SAP group at each time point (1.088 ± 0.187 vs 1.969 ± 0.290 after 1 h; 2.450 ± 0.212 vs 3.344 ± 0.386 after 4 h; 4.994 ± 0.184 vs 6.981 ± 0.301 after 8 h). The severity of SAP increased significantly (P < 0.01) over time in the SAP group (1.088 ± 0.187 vs 2.450 ± 0.212 between 1 h and 4 h after inducing pancreatitis; and 2.450 ± 0.212 vs 4.994 ± 0.184 between 4 and 8 h after inducing pancreatitis).Melatonin protects rats against acute pancreatitis-associated lung injury, probably through the upregulation of IL-22 and Th22, which increases the innate immunity of tissue cells and enhances their regeneration.","['Interleukin 22', 'Melatonin', 'Pancreatitisassociated lung injury', 'Severe acute pancreatitis', 'T helper 22 cell']"
Relative Handgrip Strength Is Inversely Associated with Metabolic Profile and Metabolic Disease in the General Population in China.,"<b>Background:</b> Absolute handgrip strength has been correlated with metabolic profile and metabolic disease. Whether relative handgrip strength is also associated with metabolic disease has not been assessed. This study aimed at assessing the association of relative handgrip strength with metabolic profile and metabolic disease in the general population in China. <b>Methods:</b> Data were derived from an ongoing cross-sectional survey of the 2013 National Physical and Health in Shanxi Province, which involved 5520 participants. Multiple linear regression or multiple logistic regression analysis were used to assess the association of absolute/relative handgrip strength with the metabolic profile, preclinical, and established stages of metabolic diseases. <b>Results:</b> This study revealed that relative handgrip strength, that is when normalized to BMI, was associated with: (1) in both genders for more favorable blood lipid levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [males: <i>b</i> = 0.19 (0.15, 0.23); females: <i>b</i> = 0.22 (0.17, 0.28)], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [males: <i>b</i> = -0.14 (-0.23, -0.05); females: <i>b</i> = -0.19 (-0.31, -0.18)], triglycerides [males: <i>b</i> = -0.58 (-0.74, -0.43); females: <i>b</i> = -0.55 (-0.74, -0.36)] and total cholesterol [males: <i>b</i> = -0.20 (-0.31, -0.10); females: <i>b</i> = -0.19 (-0.32, -0.06)]; and better serum glucose levels in males [<i>b</i> = -0.30 (-0.46, -0.15)]. (2) lower risk of impaired fasting glucose in males {third quartile [OR = 0.66 (0.45-0.95)] and fourth quartile [OR = 0.46 (0.30-0.71)] vs. first quartile} and dyslipidemia in both genders {third quartile [males: OR = 0.65 (0.48-0.87); females: OR = 0.68 (0.53-0.86)] and fourth quartile [males: OR = 0.47 (0.35-0.64); females: OR = 0.47(0.36-0.61)] vs. first quartile}. (3) lower risk of hyperlipidemia in both genders third quartile [males: OR = 0.66 (0.50-0.87); females: OR = 0.57 (0.43-0.75)] and fourth quartile [males: OR = 0.35 (0.26-0.47); females: OR = 0.51 (0.38-0.70)] vs. first quartile. However, contrary to relative handgrip strength, higher absolute handgrip strength was associated with unfavorable metabolic profiles and higher risk of metabolic diseases. These paradoxical associations were retained even after adjusted for BMI by employed a multivariate analysis. <b>Conclusion:</b> We conclude that measurement of relative handgrip strength can be used as a reasonable clinical predictor of metabolic health and disease.","['association', 'handgrip strength', 'hyperlipidemia', 'metabolism', 'type 2 diabetes mellitus']"
Changes in shoulder girdle strength in 3 consecutive years in elite adolescent swimmers: a longitudinal cohort study.,"The shoulder complex is highly loaded during swimming. No studies were found analyzing the changes in shoulder girdle strength in young swimmers, through the years.To analyze the changes in strength of internal rotators and external rotators of the arm, lower trapezius and supraspinatus and in the external rotators/internal rotators ratio in young elite swimmers through 3 years.31 adolescent elite swimmers (14-18 years, of both sexes) participated in the study. Isometric strength of the shoulder girdle muscles was performed using a handheld dynamometer during 3 years.For boys absolute data, internal rotators increased from the first to the second (p=0.0001; mean difference 45.6N; 95%CI 26.7-65.0) and third years (p=0.01; mean difference: 32.4; 95%CI: 9.3-55.5). Considering the weight-normalized data, internal rotators increased from the first to the second year (p<0.0001; mean difference: 0.52; 95%CI: 0.26-0.78), external rotators decreased from the first to the third year (p=0.003; mean difference: -0.33; 95%CI: -0.53 to -0.13) and from the second to the third year (p=0.0004; mean difference: -0.29; 95%CI: -0.46 to -0.12) and supraspinatus decreased from the second to the third year (p=0.006; mean difference: -0.17; 95%CI: -0.28 to -0.06). For girls, there were no significant differences in the absolute strength. Considering the weight-normalized data, lower trapezius decreased from the first to the third year (p=0.02; mean difference: -0.15; 95%CI: -0.27 to 0.03). Considering both sexes, the external rotators/internal rotators ratio decreased from the first to the second (p<0.0001; mean difference -0.12N; 95%CI -0.13 to -0.11) and third years (p<0.0001; mean difference -0.15N; 95%CI -0.16 to -0.14).Muscle imbalance can occur in the shoulder girdle in young swimmers in 3 years, with increased internal rotators and decreased external rotators and supraspinatus strength in boys, and decreased strength of the lower trapezius in girls. Attention should be given in young swimmers' shoulder girdle muscle balance.","['Handheld dynamometer', 'Strength measurement', 'Young athletes']"
Association of activity behaviours and patterns with cardiovascular risk factors in Swiss middle-aged adults: The CoLaus study.,"The impact of the combination between physical activity (PA) and sedentary (SE) levels on cardiovascular health is poorly known. We assessed the association of activity behaviours and patterns with cardiovascular risk factors in the general population (The CoLaus study, Switzerland, 2014-2017). 2605 adults (54.4% women, age range 45-86 years) had PA and SE levels measured for 14 days using wrist-worn accelerometry. Four activity behaviours: ""Couch potato"": low PA & high SE; ""Light mover"": low PA & low SE; ""Sedentary exerciser"": high PA & high SE, and ""Busy bee"": high PA & low SE; and three activity patterns: ""Inactive"", ""Weekend warrior"", and ""Regularly active"" were defined. Smoking, obesity, hypertension, dyslipidemia and diabetes were assessed. Relative to 'Couch potatoes', 'Sedentary exercisers' and 'Busy bees' had a lower likelihood of smoking: Odds Ratio (95% confidence interval): 0.40 (0.27-0.61) and 0.62 (0.47-0.81), obesity: 0.43 (0.29-0.63) and 0.41 (0.31-0.54), and diabetes: 0.53 (0.30-0.95) and 0.62 (0.42-0.89), respectively. Relative to 'Inactives', 'Weekend warriors' and 'Regularly actives' had a lower likelihood of smoking: 0.58 (0.43-0.78) and 0.56 (0.44-0.72), obesity: 0.41 (0.30-0.56) and 0.41 (0.32-0.53), hypertension: 0.66 (0.51-0.85) and 0.72 (0.59-0.89), and diabetes: 0.61 (0.38-0.98) and 0.60 (0.42-0.86), respectively. High PA is associated with a favourable cardiovascular risk profile, even when concomitant with high SE or when PA is concentrated on weekends. These findings suggest that being ""Sedentary exerciser"" or ""Weekend warrior"" might be sufficient to prevent cardiovascular disease.","['Accelerometry', 'Cardiovascular risk factors', 'Epidemiology', 'Pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Sedentary behaviour']"
The Prevalence of Perceived Injustice and Factors Associated With Perceived Injustice in People With Pain: A Systematic Review With Meta-analysis.,"Perceived injustice (PI) is a multidimensional appraisal cognition comprising the severity of loss consequent to injury, blame, a sense of unfairness, and/or irreparability of loss. PI gained increasing interest in pain research since it potentially contributes to the experience and burden of (chronic) pain.This systematic review aimed to determine the prevalence of PI and factors associated with PI in people with pain.Systematic review with meta-analysis.Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase were screened for cross-sectional or cohort studies encompassing human patients who were diagnosed with a condition causing pain and reported prevalence rates for PI and/or associations between a factor and PI. Meta-analyses were carried out, and subgroup analyses were undertaken based on the methodological quality of the studies, the type of pain population, and whether the outcome measure was valid or not in case of heterogeneity (P < 0.05).Fifty-four studies were found eligible. The prevalence of PI ranged from 23% to 77% (I2 = 99%, P < 0.001). Association with PI, assessed using the Injustice Experienced Questionnaire, were found with pain catastrophizing (pooled Pearson's r [rp] = 0.66 [0.64, 0.69], P < 0.00001), posttraumatic stress (rp = 0.63 [0.59, 0.67], P < 0.00001), anger (rp = 0.59 [0.49, 0.67], P < 0.00001), anxiety (rp = 0.59 [0.52, 0.64], P < 0.00001), pain acceptance (rp = -0.59 [-0.66, -0.49], P < 0.00001), depressive symptoms (rp = 0.57 [0.52, 0.60], P < 0.00001), kinesiophobia (rp = 0.57 [0.50, 0.64], P < 0.00001), academic functioning (rp = -0.54 [-0.65, -0.41], P < 0.00001), disability (rp = 0.53 [0.47, 0.59], P < 0.00001), emotional functioning (rp = -0.52 [-0.64, -0.39], P < 0.00001), pain interference (rp = 0.49 [0.35, 0.60], P < 0.00001), state anger (rp = 0.48 [0.41, 0.54], P < 0.00001), mental functioning (rp = -0.48 [-0.57, -0.38], P < 0.00001), symptoms of central sensitization (rp = 0.47 [0.39, 0.55], P < 0.00001), social functioning (rp = -0.47 [-0.60, -0.31], P < 0.00001), and physical functioning (rp = -0.43 [-0.53, -0.33], P < 0.00001), pain perceptions (rp = 0.40 [0.40, 0.64], P < 0.00001), trait anger (rp = 0.40 [0.29, 0.49], P < 0.00001), pain intensity (rp = 0.37 [0.33, 0.42], P < 0.00001), and anger inhibition (rp = 0.35 [0.26, 0.43], P < 0.00001).Some articles had to be excluded due to the absence of a full-text version. The findings can largely be applied to developed and high-income countries, but further research is needed in developing countries. Also, no validated cutoff values were available for the National Institutes of Health to determine the methodological quality of the included studies. Lastly, high heterogeneity was observed in many of the performed analyses. However, this was addressed by performing subgroup analyses, which could decrease heterogeneity in some cases.The prevalence of PI was >= 33% in 75% of the studies indicating that PI is important to consider in people with pain. There is evidence for the association of PI with psychological, pain, and quality of life characteristics in people with pain. The associations of PI with personal, injury, and recovery characteristics were overall not significant or negligible.","['association', 'metaanalysis', 'perceived injustice', 'prevalence', 'psychological', 'quality of life', 'systematic review', 'Pain']"
Maternal Dietary Diversity Decreases with Household Food Insecurity in Rural Bangladesh: A Longitudinal Analysis.,"Household food insecurity (HFI) can lead to a poor diet and malnutrition. Yet, little is known about the extent to which maternal diet covaries with food insecurity during pregnancy and lactation.Longitudinal associations between HFI and maternal dietary diversity from early pregnancy to 3 mo postpartum were examined in rural Bangladesh.We repeatedly assessed dietary intake by using a 7-d food-frequency questionnaire in the first and third trimesters of pregnancy and at 3 mo postpartum among 14,600 women enrolled into an antenatal micronutrient supplementation trial. Maternal dietary diversity score (DDS) was constructed as the sum of 10 food groups reportedly consumed at each assessment. Households were classified at 6 mo postpartum as being food secure or having mild, moderate, or severe HFI on the basis of a 9-item standard scale. Generalized estimating equations were used to estimate the longitudinal relation between HFI status and DDS and the likelihood of individual food-group consumption, adjusting for confounders at the maternal and household levels.The DDS decreased with progressively worse HFI, an association best explained by a derived household wealth index. Compared with women from food-secure households, women of mild, moderate, and severe HFI were less likely, in a dose-response fashion, to have consumed dairy products [adjusted ORs (95% CIs): 0.73 (0.69, 0.78), 0.62 (0.58, 0.66), and 0.52 (0.48, 0.55), respectively], eggs [0.81 (0.76, 0.85), 0.73 (0.68, 0.77), and 0.61 (0.57, 0.65)], meat [0.83 (0.79, 0.88), 0.73 (0.69, 0.78), and 0.60 (0.56, 0.64)], fish [0.87 (0.80, 0.94), 0.76 (0.70, 0.83), and 0.59 (0.54, 0.65)], legumes and nuts [0.88 (0.83, 0.93), 0.81 (0.76, 0.87), and 0.79 (0.74, 0.85)], and yellow and orange fruit and vegetables [0.85 (0.80, 0.91), 0.78 (0.73, 0.84), and 0.72 (0.67, 0.78)]. Neither intakes of dark-green leafy vegetables nor of vegetable oil were associated with HFI status.Antenatal and postnatal maternal dietary diversity, especially intakes of animal-source foods, fruit, and vegetables, declined with worsening food insecurity in rural Bangladesh.","['Bangladesh', 'South Asia', 'dietary diversity', 'food insecurity', 'pregnancy and lactation']"
Mediating effect of health consciousness in the relationship of lifestyle and suboptimal health status: a cross-sectional study involving Chinese urban residents.,"Suboptimal health status (SHS), a third state between good health and disease, can easily develop into chronic diseases, and can be influenced by lifestyle and health consciousness. No study has surveyed the intermediation of health consciousness on the relationship between lifestyle and SHS. This study aimed to analyse the association of lifestyle and SHS, and intermediation of health consciousness in Chinese urban residents.A cross-sectional face-to-face survey using a four-stage stratified sampling method.We investigated 5803 Chinese urban residents aged 18 years and over. We measured SHS using the Sub-Health Measurement Scale V1.0. We adopted a structural equation model to analyse relationships among lifestyle, health consciousness and SHS. We applied a bootstrapping method to estimate the mediation effect of health consciousness.Lifestyle had stronger indirect associations with physical (<i>β</i> -0.185, 95% CI -0.228 to -0.149), mental (<i>β</i> -0.224, 95% CI -0.265 to -0.186) and social SHS (<i>β</i> -0.216, 95% CI -0.257 to -0.179) via health consciousness than direct associations of physical (<i>β</i> -0.144, 95% CI -0.209 to -0.081), mental (<i>β</i> -0.146, 95% CI -0.201 to -0.094) and social SHS (<i>β</i> -0.130, 95% CI -0.181 to -0.077). Health consciousness has a strong direct association with physical (<i>β</i> 0.360, 95% CI 0.295 to 0.427), mental (<i>β</i> 0.452, 95% CI 0.392 to 0.510) and social SHS (<i>β</i> 0.434, 95% CI 0.376 to 0.490). Ratio of mediating effect of health consciousness to direct effect of lifestyle with physical, mental and social SHS was 1.28, 1.53 and 1.66, respectively.Health consciousness was more important in preventing physical, mental and social SHS than lifestyle. Therefore, it might be useful in changing unhealthy lifestyle and reducing the influence of poor lifestyle on physical, mental and social SHS.","['health policy', 'public health', 'risk management']"
The influence of neuropsychiatric and functional changes on quality of life in Alzheimer's disease.,"To investigate the influence of neuropsychiatric manifestations and functional performance on quality of life (QOL) of AD patients and their caregivers/family members.The QOL-AD scale, Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Cornell and Beck Scales for Depression, Physical and Instrumental-Self Maintenance scales (AIDL and ADL) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) were applied to 60 patients with probable AD, mild (n=30) or moderate (n=30) dementia, according to NINCDS-ADRDA and DSM-III-R criteria, respectively, and to their caregivers/family members. The total scores on the three QOL-AD versions were correlated with the measures previously mentioned.The QOL-AD patients' version displayed significant correlations with GDS (-0.76 p<0.01), Cornell (-0.53 p<0.01) and NPI (-0.46 p<0.05) in the mild dementia subgroup. The caregivers' version about patients' QOL correlated with GDS (-0.48 p<0.01), Cornell (-0.57 p<0.01), NPI (-0.46 p<0.01) and AIDL (-0.36 p<0.05), while the caregivers' version about their own QOL was significantly correlated with NPI (-0.43 p<0.01), AIDL (-0.35 p<0.05) and Beck Depression (-0.67 p<0.01). In the moderate dementia subgroup, significant correlations were observed with GDS (-0.45 p<0.05) and Cornell (-0.46 p<0.01). For the caregivers' version about patients' QOL, significant correlations emerged with Cornell (-0.68 p<0.01), NPI (-0.67 p<0.01), AIDL (-0.41 p<0.05), ADL (-0.49, p<0.01) and Beck Depression (-0.33 p<0.05). For the caregivers' version about their own QOL, significant correlations with Beck Depression (-0.54 p<0.01) and ADL (-0.38, p<0.05) were found.The symptoms presented in AD affected the QOL in patients and caregivers/family members in both mild and moderate dementia.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'caregivers', 'functional performance', 'neuropsychiatric symptoms', 'quality of life']"
How Affiliation Disclosure and Control Over User-Generated Comments Affects Consumer Health Knowledge and Behavior: A Randomized Controlled Experiment of Pharmaceutical Direct-to-Consumer Advertising on Social Media.,"More people are seeking health information online than ever before and pharmaceutical companies are increasingly marketing their drugs through social media.The aim was to examine two major concerns related to online direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising: (1) how disclosing an affiliation with a pharmaceutical company affects how people respond to drug information produced by both health organizations and online commenters, and (2) how knowledge that health organizations control the display of user-generated comments affects consumer health knowledge and behavior.We conducted a 2×2×2 between-subjects experiment (N=674). All participants viewed an infographic posted to Facebook by a health organization about a prescription allergy drug. Across conditions, the infographic varied in the degree to which the health organization and commenters appeared to be affiliated with a drug manufacturer, and the display of user-generated comments appeared to be controlled.Affiliation disclosure statements on a health organization's Facebook post increased perceptions of an organization-drug manufacturer connection, which reduced trust in the organization (point estimate -0.45, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.24) and other users who posted comments about the drug (point estimate -0.44, 95% CI -0.68 to -0.22). Furthermore, increased perceptions of an organization-manufacturer connection reduced the likelihood that people would recommend the drug to important others (point estimate -0.35, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.15), and share the drug post with others on Facebook (point estimate -0.37, 95% CI -0.64 to -0.16). An affiliation cue next to the commenters' names increased perceptions that the commenters were affiliated with the drug manufacturer, which reduced trust in the comments (point estimate -0.81, 95% CI -1.04 to -0.59), the organization that made the post (point estimate -0.68, 95% CI -0.90 to -0.49), the likelihood of participants recommending the drug (point estimate -0.61, 95% CI -0.82 to -0.43), and sharing the post with others on Facebook (point estimate -0.63, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.43). Cues indicating that a health organization removed user-generated comments from a post increased perceptions that the drug manufacturer influenced the display of the comments, which negatively affected trust in the comments (point estimate -0.35, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.20), the organization (point estimate -0.31, 95% CI -0.47 to -0.17), the likelihood of recommending the drug (point estimate -0.26, 95% CI -0.41 to -0.14), and the likelihood of sharing the post with others on Facebook (point estimate -0.28, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.15). (All estimates are unstandardized indirect effects and 95% bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals.)Concern over pharmaceutical companies hiding their affiliations and strategically controlling user-generated comments is well founded; these practices can greatly affect not only how viewers evaluate drug information online, but also how likely they are to propagate the information throughout their online and offline social networks.","['DTCA', 'Facebook', 'directtoconsumer advertising', 'health communication', 'online promotion of prescription drugs', 'pharmaceutical marketing', 'social media']"
The DiPEP (Diagnosis of PE in Pregnancy) biomarker study: An observational cohort study augmented with additional cases to determine the diagnostic utility of biomarkers for suspected venous thromboembolism during pregnancy and puerperium.,"This study aimed to estimate the diagnostic utility of biomarkers for suspected venous thromboembolism (VTE) in pregnancy and the puerperium. Research nurses/midwives collected blood samples from 310 pregnant/postpartum women with suspected pulmonary emboli (PE) and 18 with diagnosed deep vein thrombosis (DVT). VTE was diagnosed using imaging, treatment and adverse outcome data. Primary analysis was limited to women with conclusive imaging (36 with VTE, 247 without). The area under the curve (AUC) for each biomarker was: activated partial thromboplastin time 0·669 (95% confidence interval 0·570-0·768), B-type natriuretic peptide 0·549 (0·453-0·645), C-reactive protein 0·542 (0·445-0·639), Clauss fibrinogen 0·589 (0·476-0·701), D-Dimer (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) 0·668 (0·561-0·776), near-patient D-Dimer 0·651 (0·545-0·758), mid-regional pro-atrial natriuretic peptide 0·524 (0·418-0·630), prothrombin fragment 1 + 2 0·562 (0·462-0·661), plasmin-antiplasmin complexes 0·639 (0·536-0·742), prothombin time 0·613 (0·508-0·718), thrombin generation lag time 0·702 (0·598-0·806), thrombin generation endogenous potential 0·559 (0·437-0·681), thrombin generation peak 0·596 (0·478-0·715), thrombin generation time to peak 0·655 (0·541-0·769), soluble tissue factor 0·531 (0·424-0·638) and serum troponin 0·597 (0·499-0·695). No diagnostically useful threshold for diagnosing or ruling out VTE was identified. In pregnancy and the puerperium, conventional and candidate biomarkers have no utility either for their negative or positive predictive value in the diagnosis of VTE.","['Ddimer', 'biomarkers', 'diagnosis', 'postpartum', 'pregnancy', 'pulmonary embolism']"
Effect of Autophagy Inhibition on the Protection of Ischemia Preconditioning against Myocardial Ischemia/Reperfusion Injury in Diabetic Rats.,"Ischemia preconditioning (IPC) remains the most powerful intervention of protection against myocardial ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI), but diabetes can weaken or eliminate its cardioprotective effect and detailed mechanisms remain unclear. In this study, we aimed to explore whether changes of autophagy in the diabetic condition are attributable to the decreased cardioprotective effect of IPC.Sixty diabetic male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the control (C), IRI, rapamycin (R), wortmannin (W), rapamycin + IPC (R + IPC), and wortmannin + IPC (W + IPC) groups. The in vivo rat model of myocardial IRI was established by ligaturing and opening the left anterior descending coronary artery via the left thoracotomy. Durations of ischemia and reperfusion are 30 min and 120 min, respectively. Blood samples were taken at 120 min of reperfusion for measuring serum concentrations of troponin I (TnI) and creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (CK-MB) using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The infarct size was assessed by Evans blue and triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. The expressions of LC3-II, beclin-1, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), and P-Akt/Akt ratio in the ischemic myocardium were assessed by Western blotting.Compared to the IRI group, infarct size (56.1% ± 6.1% vs. 75.4 ± 7.1%, P < 0.05), serum cTnI (0.61 ± 0.21 vs. 0.95 ± 0.26 ng/ml, P < 0.05), and CK-MB levels (6.70 ± 1.25 vs. 11.51 ± 2.35 ng/ml, P < 0.05) obviously decreased in the W + IPC group. Compared with the C group, myocardial expressions of LC3-II (0.46 ± 0.04 and 0.56 ± 0.04 vs. 0.36 ± 0.04, P < 0.05) and beclin-1 (0.34 ± 0.08 and 0.38 ± 0.07 vs. 0.24 ± 0.03, P < 0.05) evidently increased, and myocardial expressions of mTOR (0.26 ± 0.08 and 0.25 ± 0.07 vs. 0.38 ± 0.06, P < 0.05), PI3K (0.29 ± 0.04 and 0.30 ± 0.03 vs. 0.38 ± 0.02, P < 0.05), and P-Akt/Akt ratio (0.49 ± 0.10 and 0.48 ± 0.06 vs. 0.72 ± 0.07, P < 0.05) markedly decreased in the IRI and R groups, indicating an increased autophagy. Compared with the IRI group, myocardial expression of beclin-1 (0.26 ± 0.03 vs. 0.34 ± 0.08, P < 0.05) significantly decreased, and myocardial expressions of mTOR (0.36 ± 0.04 vs. 0.26 ± 0.08, P < 0.05), PI3K (0.37 ± 0.03 vs. 0.29 ± 0.04, P < 0.05), and P-Akt/Akt ratio (0.68 ± 0.05 vs. 0.49 ± 0.10, P < 0.05) increased obviously in the W + IPC group, indicating a decreased autophagy.Increased autophagy in the diabetic myocardium is attributable to decreased cardioprotection of IPC, and autophagy inhibited by activating the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway can result in an improved protection of IPC against diabetic myocardial IRI.","['Autophagy', 'Diabetes', 'Ischemia Preconditioning', 'IschemiaReperfusion Injury']"
"Public preferences for electronic health data storage, access, and sharing - evidence from a pan-European survey.","To assess the public's preferences regarding potential privacy threats from devices or services storing health-related personal data.A pan-European survey based on a stated-preference experiment for assessing preferences for electronic health data storage, access, and sharing.We obtained 20 882 survey responses (94 606 preferences) from 27 EU member countries. Respondents recognized the benefits of storing electronic health information, with 75.5%, 63.9%, and 58.9% agreeing that storage was important for improving treatment quality, preventing epidemics, and reducing delays, respectively. Concerns about different levels of access by third parties were expressed by 48.9% to 60.6% of respondents.On average, compared to devices or systems that only store basic health status information, respondents preferred devices that also store identification data (coefficient/relative preference 95% CI = 0.04 [0.00-0.08], P = 0.034) and information on lifelong health conditions (coefficient = 0.13 [0.08 to 0.18], P < 0.001), but there was no evidence of this for devices with information on sensitive health conditions such as mental and sexual health and addictions (coefficient = -0.03 [-0.09 to 0.02], P = 0.24). Respondents were averse to their immediate family (coefficient = -0.05 [-0.05 to -0.01], P = 0.011) and home care nurses (coefficient = -0.06 [-0.11 to -0.02], P = 0.004) viewing this data, and strongly averse to health insurance companies (coefficient = -0.43 [-0.52 to 0.34], P < 0.001), private sector pharmaceutical companies (coefficient = -0.82 [-0.99 to -0.64], P < 0.001), and academic researchers (coefficient = -0.53 [-0.66 to -0.40], P < 0.001) viewing the data.Storing more detailed electronic health data was generally preferred, but respondents were averse to wider access to and sharing of this information. When developing frameworks for the use of electronic health data, policy makers should consider approaches that both highlight the benefits to the individual and minimize the perception of privacy risks.","['Health records', 'attitudes', 'data privacy', 'personal data', 'public preferences', 'stated preference']"
"Estimation of genetic parameters for productive life, reproduction, and milk-production traits in US dairy goats.","Heritabilities and correlations for milk yield (MY), fat yield (FY), protein yield (PY), combined fat and protein yield (FPY), fat percentage (F%), protein percentage (P%), age at first kidding (AFK), interval between the first and second kidding (KI), and real and functional productive life at 72mo (FPL72) of 33,725 US dairy goats, were estimated using animal models. Productive life was defined as the total days in production until 72mo of age (PL72) for goats having the opportunity to express the trait. Functional productive life was obtained by correcting PL72 for MY, FY, PY, and final type score (FS). Six selection indexes were used, including or excluding PL72, with 6 groups of different economic weights, to estimate the responses to selection considering MY, FY, PY, and PL72 as selection criteria. The main criteria that determined the culling of a goat from the herd were low FS, MY, and FY per lactation. Heritability estimates were 0.22, 0.17, 0.37, 0.37, 0.38, 0.39, 0.54, 0.64, 0.09, and 0.16 for PL72, FPL72, MY, FY, PY, FPY, F%, P%, KI, and AFK, respectively. Most genetic correlations between the evaluated traits and PL72 or FPL72 were positive, except for F% (-0.04 and -0.06, respectively), P% (-0.002 and -0.03, respectively), and AFK (-0.03 and -0.01, respectively). The highest genetic correlations were between FPL72 and MY (0.39) and between PL72 and MY (0.33). Most phenotypic correlations between the traits evaluated and FPL72 and PL72 were positive (>0.23 and >0.26, respectively), except for F% (-0.004 and -0.02, respectively), P% (-0.05 and -0.02), KI (-0.01 and -0.07), and AFK (-0.08 and -0.08). The direct selection for PL72 increased it by 102.28d per generation. The use of MY, FY, PY, KI, or AFK as selection criteria increased PL72 by 39.21, 27.33, 35.90, -8.28, or 2.77d per generation, respectively. The inclusion of PL72 as selection criterion increased the expected response per generation from 0.15 to 17.35% in all selection indices studied.","['genetic correlation', 'heritability', 'productive life', 'selection index']"
Viscous dissipation effect on unsteady magneto-convective heat-mass transport passing in a vertical porous plate with thermal radiation.,"The effects of radiative and viscous dissipation on the transfer of unsteady magnetic-conductive heat-mass across a vertically porous sheet is studied in this article. The non-dimensional ODEs are solved by applying the Finite Difference Method (FDM) through the MATLAB software numerically. The fluid temperature and velocity enhance for uplifting values of the Eckert number. Enhancing values of the transpiration parameter the velocity, concentration, and temperature distributions reduce. The local skin friction enhances about 9%, and 18% due to increase the Eckert number (0.5-3.0) and Dufour number (0.5-4.0), respectively and reduces 17%, 38%, and 31% due to increase Prandtl number (0.71-7.0), magnetic force parameter (0.5-3.0), and suction parameter (0.5-3.0), respectively. Enhancing values of the Eckert number (0.5-3.0) reduces the heat transfer rate by 40%. The increasing value of the Prandtl number (0.71-7.0) and the suction parameter (0.5-3.0) increases the heat transfer rate by 27% and 92%, respectively. With an increase in the values of the Schmidt number (0.22-0.67), the mass transfer rate increased by approximately 94%. At last, the numerical results of this paper has compared with the previously published paper. We noticed that the comparison has an excellent acceptance.","['Heat and mass transfer', 'MHD', 'Permeability', 'Thermal radiation', 'Viscous dissipation']"
Indoor air pollution (IAP) and pre-existing morbidities among under-5 children in India: are risk factors of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)?,"Globally, the Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is linked with air pollution of both indoor and outdoor environments and co-morbidities conditions of human beings. To find out the risk factor zones associated with Coronavirus disease among under-five children using pre-existing morbidity conditions and indoor air pollution (IAP) environmental factors and also with current fatality and recovery rate of COVID-19 disease in India. Data was utilized from the 4th round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), 2015-16, and from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) on 18th May 2020. Mean, standard deviation, and Z-score statistical methods have been employed to find out the risk factor zones i.e. to execute the objective. Findings of this study are, the states and UTs which have more likely to very higher to higher risk factors or zones of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are Mizoram (1.4), Meghalaya (1.27), Uttarakhand (0.92), West Bengal (0.73), Uttar Pradesh (0.66), Jammu and Kashmir (0.44), Odisha (0.33), Madhya Pradesh (0.21), Jharkhand (0.20), Bihar (0.19), Maharashtra (0.16 risk score), compared to UTs like Assam (-0.12), Rajasthan (-0.13), Goa (-0.14), Manipur (-0.17), Chandigarh (-0.19), Haryana (-0.22), Delhi (-0.27) have moderate risk factors of COVID-19, and the states and UTs like Daman and Diu (-1.18), Sikkim (-0.98), Andaman and Nicobar Islands (-0.84), Kerala (-0.69), Dadra and Nagar Haveli (-0.68), Arunachal Pradesh ( 0.-53), Karnataka (-0.42), and Nagaland (-0.36) have very low-risk zones of COVID-19 deaths. From a research viewpoint, there is a prerequisite need for epidemiological studies to investigate the connection between indoor air pollution and pre-existing morbidity which are associated with COVID-19. Well-built public health measures, including rapidly searching in high focus areas and testing of COVID-19, should be performed in vulnerable areas of COVID-19.","['COVID19', 'Case Fatality Ratio', 'India', 'Indoor air pollution', 'Morbidity', 'Risk Factor']"
Association of three common BARD1 variants with cancer susceptibility: a system review and meta-analysis.,"BARD1 has been shown to play tumor suppressive roles in human cancer. We performed this meta-analysis and firstly evaluated the association between three common BARD1 polymorphisms (Arg378Ser, Val507Met and Pro24Ser) and cancer susceptibility. We performed this meta-analysis following PRISMA guidelines. A comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, OVID and Web of Science databases was done from database inception to August 2014. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were combined to measure the association between BARD1 polymorphisms and cancer risk. On the basis of 10 studies about BARD1 polymorphisms and cancer, we found that BARD1 Val507Met (G/A) polymorphism was associated with decreased cancer susceptibility (allelic model: OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.66-0.87, P < 0.00001; dominant model: OR = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.65-0.91, P < 0.00001; recessive model: OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.55-0.74, P < 0.00001; homozygote comparison: OR = 0.58, 95% CI: 0.49-0.70, P < 0.00001; heterozygote comparison: OR = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.74-0.99 , P = 0.0008). BARD1 Pro24Ser (C/T) polymorphism was also associated decreased cancer risk in allelic model (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.60-0.88, P = 0.0009), dominant model (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.56-0.87, P = 0.004), recessive model (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.56-0.87 , P = 0.004), homozygote comparison (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.39-0.78, P = 0.0007) and heterozygote comparison (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.62-0.91, P = 0.004). And in our sensitivity analysis, when deleting the study performed by Capasso in 2009, we found that BARD1 Arg378Ser polymorphism was associated with decreased cancer risk in allelic model (OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67-0.97, P = 0.02), dominant model (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.56-0.91, P = 0.007) and heterozygote comparison (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.57-0.91, 0 = 0.006). In conclusion, BARD1 Arg378Ser, Val507Met and Pro24Ser may be associated with decreased cancer risk. More studies with larger samples and gene-environment interactions are needed to confirm our findings.","['BARD1', 'cancer risk', 'metaanalysis', 'polymorphism']"
What's the role of perceived social support and coping styles in depression and anxiety?,"Due to the excessive and pathologic effects of depression and anxiety, it is important to identify the role of protective factors, such as effective coping and social support. This study examined the associations between perceived social support and coping styles with depression and anxiety levels.This cross sectional study was part of the Study on the Epidemiology of Psychological, Alimentary Health and Nutrition project. A total 4658 individuals aged ≥20 years was selected by cluster random sampling. Subjects completed questionnaires, which were used to describe perceived social support, coping styles, depression and anxiety. t-test, Chi-square test, pearson's correlation and Logistic regression analysis were used in data analyses.The results of Logistic regression analysis showed after adjusting demographic characteristics for odd ratio of anxiety, active copings such as positive re-interpretation and growth with odds ratios; 95% confidence interval: 0.82 (0.76, 0.89), problem engagement (0.92 [0.87, 0.97]), acceptance (0.82 [0.74, 0.92]) and also among perceived social supports, family (0.77 [0.71, 0.84]) and others (0.84 [0.76, 0.91]) were protective. In addition to, for odd ratio of depression, active copings such as positive re-interpretation and growth (0.74 [0.69, 0.79]), problem engagement (0.89 [0.86, 0.93]), and support seeking (0.96 [0.93, 0.99]) and all of social support types (family [0.75 (0.70, 0.80)], friends [0.90 (0.85, 0.95)] and others [0.80 (0.75, 0.86)]) were protective. Avoidance was risk factor for both of anxiety (1.19 [1.12, 1.27]) and depression (1.22 [1.16, 1.29]).This study shows active coping styles and perceived social supports particularly positive re-interpretation and family social support are protective factors for depression and anxiety.","['Anxiety', 'coping styles', 'depression', 'perceived social support']"
"Efficacy of etoricoxib, celecoxib, lumiracoxib, non-selective NSAIDs, and acetaminophen in osteoarthritis: a mixed treatment comparison.","To compare the efficacy of etoricoxib, lumiracoxib, celecoxib, non-selective (ns) NSAIDs and acetaminophen in the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA) METHODS: Randomized placebo controlled trials investigating the effects of acetaminophen 4000mg, diclofenac 150mg, naproxen 1000mg, ibuprofen 2400mg, celecoxib 100-400mg, lumiracoxib 100-400mg, and etoricoxib 30-60mg with treatment duration of at least two weeks were identified with a systematic literature search. The endpoints of interest were pain, physical function and patient global assessment of disease status (PGADS). Pain and physical function reported on different scales (VAS or LIKERT) were translated into effect sizes (ES). An ES 0.2 - 0.5 was defined as a ""small"" treatment effect, whereas ES of 0.5 - 0.8 and > 0.8 were defined as ""moderate"" and ""large"", respectively. A negative effect indicated superior effects of the treatment group compared to the control group. Results of all trials were analyzed simultaneously with a Bayesian mixed treatment comparison.There is a >95% probability that etoricoxib (30 or 60mg) shows the greatest improvement in pain and physical function of all interventions compared. ESs of etoricoxib 30mg relative to placebo, celecoxib 200mg, ibuprofen 2400mg, and diclofenac 150mg were -0.66 (95% Credible Interval -0.83; -0.49), -0.32 (-0.50; -0.14), -0.25 (-0.53; 0.03), and -0.17 (-0.41; 0.08), respectively. Regarding physical functioning, ESs of etoricoxib 30mg relative to placebo, celecoxib 200mg, ibuprofen 2400mg, and diclofenac 150mg were -0.61 (-0.76; -0.46), -0.27 (-0.43; -0.10), -0.20 (-0.47; 0.07), and -0.09 (- 0.33; 0.14) respectively. The greatest improvements in PGADS were expected with either etoricoxib or diclofenac.The current study estimated the efficacy of acetaminophen, nsNSAIDs, and COX-2 selective NSAIDs in OA and found that etoricoxib 30 mg is likely to result in the greatest improvements in pain and physical function. Differences in PGADS between interventions were smaller.","['Acetaminophen', 'Bayesian', 'NSAIDs', 'celecoxib', 'etoricoxib', 'lumiracoxib', 'metaanalysis', 'osteoarthritis']"

Assessment of quadriceps muscle thickness using bedside ultrasonography by nurses and physicians in the intensive care unit: Intra- and inter-operator agreement.,"Data regarding the agreement among multiple operators for measurement of quadriceps muscle thickness by bedside ultrasonography (USG) are sparse.To statistically assess the agreement among 5 operators for measurement of quadriceps muscle thickness on bedside USG.This was a cross-sectional observational study. The 5 operators of varied experience (comprised of 1 critical care consultant, 2 fellows, and 2 nurses) independently measured quadriceps muscle thickness in triplicate for 45 critically ill patients each, using USG. Intra- and interrater agreement rates among the 5 operators were assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and expressed with 95% confidence interval (CI).The 5 operators produced a total of 135 readings and 675 observations for ICC calculations to determine the intraoperator and interoperator variations respectively. For intraoperator agreement, the overall ICC (95%CI) was 0.998 (0.997, 0.999) for operator 1, 0.998 (0.997, 0.999) for operator 2, 0.997 (0.995, 0.999) for operator 3, 0.999 (0.998, 0.999) for operator 4, and 0.998 (0.997, 0.999) for operator 5. For interoperator agreement, the overall ICC (95%CI) was 0.977 (0.965, 0.986; <i>P</i> < 0.001) for reading 1, 0.974 (0.960, 0.984; <i>P</i> < 0.001) for reading 2, and 0.975 (0.961, 0.985; <i>P</i> < 0.001) for reading 3.USG measurement of quadriceps muscle thickness was not dependent on clinical experience, supporting training for nurses in it.","['Agreement', 'Critical illness', 'Intensive care unit', 'Muscle thickness', 'Quadriceps muscle', 'Ultrasonography']"
The Medium-Term Impact of COVID-19 Lockdown on Referrals to Secondary Care Mental Health Services: A Controlled Interrupted Time Series Study.,"To date, there is a paucity of information regarding the effect of COVID-19 or lockdown on mental disorders. We aimed to quantify the medium-term impact of lockdown on referrals to secondary care mental health clinical services. We conducted a controlled interrupted time series study using data from Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust (CPFT), UK (catchment population ~0.86 million). The UK lockdown resulted in an instantaneous drop in mental health referrals but then a longer-term acceleration in the referral rate (by 1.21 referrals per day per day, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41-2.02). This acceleration was primarily for urgent or emergency referrals (acceleration 0.96, CI 0.39-1.54), including referrals to liaison psychiatry (0.68, CI 0.35-1.02) and mental health crisis teams (0.61, CI 0.20-1.02). The acceleration was significant for females (0.56, CI 0.04-1.08), males (0.64, CI 0.05-1.22), working-age adults (0.93, CI 0.42-1.43), people of White ethnicity (0.98, CI 0.32-1.65), those living alone (1.26, CI 0.52-2.00), and those who had pre-existing depression (0.78, CI 0.19-1.38), severe mental illness (0.67, CI 0.19-1.15), hypertension/cardiovascular/cerebrovascular disease (0.56, CI 0.24-0.89), personality disorders (0.32, CI 0.12-0.51), asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.28, CI 0.08-0.49), dyslipidemia (0.26, CI 0.04-0.47), anxiety (0.21, CI 0.08-0.34), substance misuse (0.21, CI 0.08-0.34), or reactions to severe stress (0.17, CI 0.01-0.32). No significant post-lockdown acceleration was observed for children/adolescents, older adults, people of ethnic minorities, married/cohabiting people, and those who had previous/pre-existing dementia, diabetes, cancer, eating disorder, a history of self-harm, or intellectual disability. This evidence may help service planning and policy-making, including preparation for any future lockdown in response to outbreaks.","['COVID19SARSCoV2 coronavirus pandemic', 'comorbidity', 'controlled interrupted time series analysis', 'lockdown', 'secondary care mental health services']"
Effects of in-season enhanced negative work-based vs traditional weight training on change of direction and hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio in soccer players.,"The present study investigated the effects of in-season enhanced negative work-based training (ENT) vs weight training in the change of direction (COD), sprinting and jumping ability, muscle mass and strength in semi-professional soccer players. Forty male soccer players participated in the eight-week, 1 d/w intervention consisting of 48 squat repetitions for ENT using a flywheel device (inertia=0.11 kg·m <b><sup>-2</sup></b> ) or weight training (80%1 RM) as a control group (CON). Agility T-test, 20+20 m shuttle, 10 m and 30 m sprint, squat jump (SJ) and countermovement jump (CMJ), lean mass, quadriceps and hamstrings strength and the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio were measured. Time on agility T-test and 20+20 m shuttle decreased in ENT (effect-size =-1.44, 95% CI -2.24/-0.68 and -0.75, -1.09/-0.42 respectively) but not in CON (-0.33, -0.87/0.19 and -0.13, -0.58/0.32). SJ and CMJ height increased in both ENT (0.71, 0.45/0.97 and 0.65, 0.38/0.93) and CON (0.41, 0.23/0.60 and 0.36, 0.12/0.70). Overall, quadriceps and hamstrings strength increased in both ENT and CON (0.38/0.79), but the hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio increased in ENT (0.31, 0.22/0.40) but not in CON (0.03, -0.18/0.24). Lean mass increased in both ENT (0.41, 0.26/0.57) and CON (0.29, 0.14/0.44). The repeated negative actions performed in ENT may have led to improvements in braking ability, a key point in COD performance. Semi-professional soccer players may benefit from in-season ENT to enhance COD and the negative-specific adaptations in muscle strength and hamstrings-to-quadriceps ratio.","['Eccentric exercise', 'Flywheel', 'Football', 'Isokinetic strength', 'Jump performance', 'Sprint ability', 'Team sport']"
Staging achilles tendinopathy using ultrasound imaging: the development and investigation of a new ultrasound imaging criteria based on the continuum model of tendon pathology.,"To develop a standardised ultrasound imaging (USI)-based criteria for the diagnosis of tendinopathy that aligns with the continuum model of tendon pathology. Secondary aims were to assess both the intra-rater and inter-rater reliability of the criteria.A criteria was developed following a face validity assessment and a total of 31 Achilles tendon ultrasound images were analysed. Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were assessed for overall tendinopathy stage (normal, reactive/early dysrepair or late dysrepair/degenerative) as well as for individual parameters (thickness, echogenicity and vascularity). Quadratic weighted kappa (k<sub>w</sub>) was used to report on reliability.Intra-rater reliability was 'substantial' for overall tendinopathy staging (k<sub>w</sub> rater A; 0.77, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.94, rater B; 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.89) and ranged from 'substantial' to 'almost perfect' for thickness (k<sub>w</sub> rater A; 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.90, rater B; 0.84, 95% CI 0.71 to 0.98), echogenicity (k<sub>w</sub> rater A; 0.78, 95% CI 0.62 to 0.95, rater B; 0.73, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.89) and vascularity (k<sub>w</sub> rater A; 0.86, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98, rater B; 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99). Inter-rater reliability ranged from 'substantial' to 'almost perfect' for overall tendinopathy staging (k<sub>w</sub> round 1; 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.91, round 2; 0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.99), thickness (k<sub>w</sub> round 1; 0.65, 95% CI 0.48 to 0.83, round 2; 0.77, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.93), echogenicity (k<sub>w</sub> round 1; 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.85, round 2; 0.76, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.94) and vascularity (k<sub>w</sub> round 1; 0.89, 95% CI 0.79 to 0.99, round 2; 0.86, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.98). Inter-rater reliability increased from 'substantial' in round 1 (k<sub>w</sub> 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 to 0.91) to 'almost perfect' in round 2 (0.81, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.99).Intra-rater and inter-rater reliability were 'substantial' to 'almost perfect' when utilising an USI-based criteria to diagnose Achilles tendinopathy. This is the first study to use the continuum model of tendon pathology to develop an USI-based criteria to diagnose tendinopathy.","['diagnosis', 'tendinopathy', 'tendinosis', 'tendon', 'ultrasound']"
"Assessing the variability and predictability of adipokines (adiponectin, leptin, resistin and their ratios) in non-obese and obese women with anovulatory polycystic ovary syndrome.","To assess the variability and predictability of adiponectin, leptin, resistin and their ratios in non-obese and obese women with anovulatory polycystic ovary syndrome (aPCOS).A total of 52 ovulatory controls (mean age = 31.63 ± 4.88 years, BMI = 25.33 ± 2.68 kg/m<sup>2</sup>); 54 non-obese (mean age = 32.11 ± 4.25 years, BMI = 25.72 ± 2.95 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and 50 obese women with aPCOS (mean age = 33.64 ± 4.14 years, BMI = 39.19 ± 2.99 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were recruited.

"Additional lymphadenectomy might not improve survival of patients with resectable metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma of T4 stage, proximal location, poor/undifferentiation, or N3/N4 stages: a large population-based study.","This study was performed to evaluate the prognostic effect of lymphadenectomy on outcomes in patients with resectable metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma (mCRC). We selected patients with mCRC from 2004 to 2013 from Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER) database. Kaplan-Meier analysis, univariate Cox regression and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to assess the clinical value of lymphadenectomy on overall survival (OS) and cause-specific survival (CSS) of patients with resectable mCRC. A total 24178 eligible patients were included, 23056 (95.36%) of which received lymphadenectomy. Results showed that lymphadenectomy was an independent protective factor for survival of patients with mCRC overall [OS (HR: 0.86, 95%CI: 0.79-0.93, P=0.002) and CSS (HR: 0.85, 95%CI: 0.78-0.93, P<0.001)].

Geometric accuracy evaluation of a six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) couch with cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) using a phantom and correlation study of the position errors in pelvic tumor radiotherapy.,"To assess the position accuracy of the six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) couch based on cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and exploit the correlation of the six degrees errors.CT scans of an anthropomorphic phantom and patients were obtained at 3 mm slice thicknesses using a Philips scanner at the head, first supine and prostrate positions. An Eclipse Treatment Planning System was used to create a treatment plan. Different levels of known position errors were introduced to simulate patient position status for the anthropomorphic phantom. CBCT datasets for each position were acquired and registered to original CT datasets to evaluate the accuracy of the 6-DoF couch and determine the setup errors of patients. The setup errors of 200 CBCT datasets from 14 patients with pelvic tumors were analyzed. The correlations between six degrees position errors were finally extracted.For the phantom study, the difference between known introduced errors and the setup errors were almost negligible. The deviation (mean ± one standard deviation) in registration methods were (0.01±0.02) cm, (0.04±0.075) cm, (0.02±0.004) cm, (0.01±0.04)°, (0.1±0.08)°, (0.03±0.05)° and (0.01±0.01) cm, (0.03±0.007) cm, (0.01±0.01) cm, (0.05±0.06)°, (0.08±0.08)°, (0.04±0.05)° for supine and prone position, respectively. The deviation in positions were (0.07±0.10) cm, (0.16±0.02) cm, (0.08±0.06) cm, (0.54±0.46)°, (0.24±0.16)°, (0.09±0.09)° and (0.06±0.09) cm, (0.19±0.09) cm, (0.09±0.07) cm, (0.49±0.49)°, (0.16±0.08)°, (0.1±0.13)° for bone and soft tissue registration methods, respectively. For patient data, the setup errors were (-0.07±0.22) cm, (0.14±0.35) cm, (-0.12±0.4) cm, (0.79±1.6)°, (0.41±0.71)°, (-0.03±0.8)° for supine position and (0.16±0.27) cm, (0.19±0.48) cm, (-0.05±0.34) cm, (1.1±1.49)°, (0.65±1.00)°, (-0.23±0.75)° for prone position, respectively. There is a significant moderate correlation between the longitudinal and pitch directions and between the vertical and pitch directions when the patient is in the supine position.The six-dimensional couch positioning verification system based on CBCT has high accuracy and can meet the requirements of precise radiotherapy for pelvic tumors. There is a certain correlation between translation direction and rotation direction.","['Positioning error', 'cone beam computed tomography CBCT', 'correlation analysis', 'sixdegreeoffreedom 6DoF couch']"
Macrophage Markers Do Not Add to the Prediction of Liver Fibrosis by Transient Elastography in Patients With Metabolic Associated Fatty Liver Disease.,"<b>Background and Aims:</b> Non-invasive fibrosis staging is essential in metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). Transient elastography (TE) is a well-established method for liver fibrosis assessment. We have previously shown that the macrophage marker sCD163 is an independent predictor for fibrosis in MAFLD. In the present study we tested whether the combination of macrophage markers and TE improves fibrosis prediction. <b>Methods:</b> We measured macrophage markers soluble (s)CD163 and mannose receptor (sMR) in two independent cohorts from Italy (<i>n</i> = 141) and Sweden (<i>n</i> = 70) with biopsy-proven MAFLD and available TE. <b>Results:</b> In the Italian cohort, TE and sCD163 showed similar moderate associations with liver fibrosis (rho = 0.56, <i>p</i> < 0.001 and rho = 0.42, <i>p</i> < 0.001, respectively). TE had an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics curve (AUROC, with 95% CI) for fibrosis; F ≥ 2 = 0.79 (0.72-0.86), F ≥ 3 = 0.81 (0.73-0.89), F4 = 0.95 (0.90-1.0). sCD163 also predicted fibrosis well [F ≥ 2 = 0.71 (0.63-0.80), F ≥ 3 = 0.82 (0.74-0.90), F4 = 0.89 (0.76-1.0)]. However, combining sCD163 and TE did not improve the AUROCs significantly [F ≥ 2 = 0.79 (0.72-0.86), F ≥ 3 = 0.85 (0.78-0.92), F4 = 0.97 (0.93-1.0)]. In the Swedish cohort, TE showed a closer association with fibrosis (rho = 0.73, <i>p</i> < 0.001) than sCD163 (rho = 0.43, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and sMR (rho = 0.46, <i>p</i> < 0.001). TE predicted fibrosis well [F ≥ 2 = 0.88 (0.80-0.97), F ≥ 3 = 0.90 (0.83-0.97), F4 = 0.87 (0.78-0.96)], whereas sCD163 did not (best AUROC 0.75). sMR showed a better prediction [F ≥ 2 = 0.68 (0.56-0.81), F ≥ 3 = 0.82 (0.71-0.92), F4 = 0.79 (0.66-0.93)], but the addition of sMR did not further improve the prediction of fibrosis by TE. <b>Conclusion:</b> In these cohorts of MAFLD patients, TE was superior to macrophage markers for fibrosis prediction and in contrast to our hypothesis the addition of these markers to TE did not improve its predictive capability.","['Fibroscan', 'NAFLD', 'biomarkers', 'cirrhosis', 'macrophages']"
The impact of visceral and general obesity on vascular and left ventricular function and geometry: a cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging study of the UK Biobank.,"We aimed to evaluate the associations of body fat distribution with cardiovascular function and geometry in the middle-aged general population.Four thousand five hundred and ninety participants of the UK Biobank (54% female, mean age 61.1 ± 7.2 years) underwent cardiac magnetic resonance for assessment of left ventricular (LV) parameters [end-diastolic volume (EDV), ejection fraction (EF), cardiac output (CO), and index (CI)] and magnetic resonance imaging for body composition analysis [subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT)]. Body fat percentage (BF%) was assessed by bioelectrical impedance. Linear regressions were performed to assess the impact of visceral (VAT) and general (SAT and BF%) obesity on cardiac function and geometry. Visceral obesity was associated with a smaller EDV [VAT: β -1.74 (-1.15 to -2.33)], lower EF [VAT: β -0.24 (-0.12 to -0.35), SAT: β 0.02 (-0.04 to 0.08), and BF%: β 0.02 (-0.02 to 0.06)] and the strongest negative association with CI [VAT: β -0.05 (-0.06 to -0.04), SAT: β -0.02 (-0.03 to -0.01), and BF% β -0.01 (-0.013 to -0.007)]. In contrast, general obesity was associated with a larger EDV [SAT: β 1.01 (0.72-1.30), BF%: β 0.37 (0.23-0.51)] and a higher CO [SAT: β 0.06 (0.05-0.07), BF%: β 0.02 (0.01-0.03)]. In the gender-specific analysis, only men had a significant association between VAT and EF [β -0.35 (-0.19 to -0.51)].Visceral obesity was associated with a smaller LV EDV and subclinical lower LV systolic function in men, suggesting that visceral obesity might play a more important role compared to general obesity in LV remodelling.","['Body fat distribution', 'Left ventricular function', 'Left ventricular geometry', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Obesity', 'Visceral adipose tissue']"
Assessment of a Combination of Clinical Maneuvers in Evaluation of Post-Laparoscopic Pain: A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"To assess the efficacy of the combined maneuvers in evaluation of post-laparoscopic pain.A randomized controlled study was conducted. Sixty-four women were included in the study and were randomly divided into two groups. Intervention group received combined maneuvers such as intraperitoneal normal saline infusion, pulmonary recruitment maneuver and local bupivacaine instillation at port sites after laparoscopic surgery. Control group received routine care.Upper abdominal pain, shoulder pain and incision site pain were noted in both groups at 3, 6, 12, 24 and 48 h postoperatively.The median interquartile range (in centiles) of upper abdominal pain score 3, 6 and 12 h postoperatively in the intervention group was 1.0 (0.25-1.0), 1.0 (0.0-1.0) and 0.50 (0.0-1.0), and in the control group, the values were 2.0 (2.0-1.0), 2.0 (2.0-1.0) and 1.0 (0-1.0) at 3, 6 and 12 h, respectively (<i>p</i> < 0.000). The median interquartile range of shoulder pain score 3, 6 and 12 h postoperatively in the intervention group was 0.0 (0.0-1.0), 0.0 (0.0-0.75) and 0.0 (0.0-1.0), and in the control group, the values were 1.0 (0.0-2.0), 1.0 (0.0-1.75) and 1.0 (0-1.0) at 3, 6, and 12 h. The upper abdominal pain and shoulder pain relief was significantly more in the intervention group than in the control group in the first 12 h of surgery.Combined maneuvers could significantly reduce post-laparoscopic upper abdominal and shoulder pain.<i>Clinical Trial</i> CTRI Registration Number-CTRI/2017/07/0089, web address of CTRI-http://ctri.nic.in.","['Incision site pain', 'Intraperitoneal normal saline infusion', 'Local anaesthetics', 'Post laparoscopic shoulder pain', 'Pulmonary recruitment maneuver', 'Upper abdomen pain']"
(1)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy-based metabonomic study in patients with cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy.,"To identify plasma metabolites used as biomarkers in order to distinguish cirrhotics from controls and encephalopathics.A clinical study involving stable cirrhotic patients with and without overt hepatic encephalopathy was designed. A control group of healthy volunteers was used. Plasma from those patients was analysed using (1)H - nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. We used the Carr Purcell Meiboom Gill sequence to process the sample spectra at ambient probe temperature. We used a gated secondary irradiation field for water signal suppression. Samples were calibrated and referenced using the sodium trimethyl silyl propionate peak at 0.00 ppm. For each sample 128 transients (FID's) were acquired into 32 K complex data points over a spectral width of 6 KHz. 30 degree pulses were applied with an acquisition time of 4.0 s in order to achieve better resolution, followed by a recovery delay of 12 s, to allow for complete relaxation and recovery of the magnetisation. A metabolic profile was created for stable cirrhotic patients without signs of overt hepatic encephalopathy and encephalopathic patients as well as healthy controls. Stepwise discriminant analysis was then used and discriminant factors were created to differentiate between the three groups.Eighteen stabled cirrhotic patients, eighteen patients with overt hepatic encephalopathy and seventeen healthy volunteers were recruited. Patients with cirrhosis had significantly impaired ketone body metabolism, urea synthesis and gluconeogenesis. This was demonstrated by higher concentrations of acetoacetate (0.23 ± 0.02 vs 0.05 ± 0.00, P < 0.01), and b-hydroxybutarate (0.58 ± 0.14 vs 0.08 ± 0.00, P < 0.01), lower concentrations of glutamine (0.44 ± 0.08 vs 0.63 ± 0.03, P < 0.05), histidine (0.16 ± 0.01 vs 0.36 ± 0.04, P < 0.01) and arginine (0.08 ± 0.01 vs 0.14 ± 0.02, P < 0.03) and higher concentrations of glutamate (1.36 ± 0.25 vs 0.58 ± 0.04, P < 0.01), lactate (1.53 ± 0.11 vs 0.42 ± 0.05, P < 0.01), pyruvate (0.11 ± 0.02 vs 0.03 ± 0.00, P < 0.01) threonine (0.39 ± 0.02 vs 0.08 ± 0.01, P < 0.01) and aspartate (0.37 ± 0.03 vs 0.03 ± 0.01). A five metabolite signature by stepwise discriminant analysis could separate between controls and cirrhotic patients with an accuracy of 98%. In patients with encephalopathy we observed further derangement of ketone body metabolism, impaired production of glycerol and myoinositol, reversal of Fischer's ratio and impaired glutamine production as demonstrated by lower b-hydroxybutyrate (0.58 ± 0.14 vs 0.16 ± 0.02, P < 0.0002), higher acetoacetate (0.23 ± 0.02 vs 0.41 ± 0.16, P < 0.05), leucine (0.33 ± 0.02 vs 0.49 ± 0.05, P < 0.005) and isoleucine (0.12 ± 0.02 vs 0.27 ± 0.02, P < 0.0004) and lower glutamine (0.44 ± 0.08 vs 0.36 ± 0.04, P < 0.013), glycerol (0.53 ± 0.03 vs 0.19 ± 0.02, P < 0.000) and myoinositol (0.36 ± 0.04 vs 0.18 ± 0.02, P < 0.010) concentrations. A four metabolite signature by stepwise discriminant analysis could separate between encephalopathic and cirrhotic patients with an accuracy of 87%.Patients with cirrhosis and patients with hepatic encephalopathy exhibit distinct metabolic abnormalities and the use of metabonomics can select biomarkers for these diseases.","['Branch chain amino acids', 'Glutamine', 'Glycolysis', 'Ketone bodies']"
Participation in organized sports is associated with decreased likelihood of unhealthy lifestyle habits in adolescents.,"Adolescence is a pivotal time for investing in both present and future health. Thus, it is important to identify arenas for promoting positive adolescent health behaviors and preventing negative ones. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between organized sports participation (OSP) and a broad range of lifestyle habits in Norwegian adolescents. A comprehensive survey was completed by 13 269 junior high and high school students in southern Norway. Multivariable binary logistic regression models, adjusted for gender, age, and parental education, were used to investigate the associations between OSP and adolescent substance use, dietary habits, physical activity level, passive vs active transportation, screen time, and sleep duration. Inverse associations were found between OSP and adolescent substance use (odds ratio 0.40 [95% confidence interval 0.30-0.52] to 0.68 [0.61-0.76]), irregular consumption of main meals (0.58 [0.53-0.63] to 0.78 [0.70-0.89]), high intake of unhealthy food and beverages (0.55 [0.47-0.65] to 0.86 [0.75-0.98]), low intake of healthy food items (0.57 [0.51-0.63] to 0.77 [0.70-0.84]), low physical activity level (0.15 [0.14-0.17]), high screen-based activity (0.61 [0.55-0.67]), passive vs active transportation (summer; 0.79 [0.72-0.86] and winter; 0.84 [0.77-0.92]), and short sleep duration, during both weekdays (0.57 [0.52-0.63]) and weekends (0.79 [0.69-0.89]). In conclusion, adolescents participating in organized sports had decreased odds for engaging in several unhealthy lifestyle habits compared with non-participants, indicating that organized sports may be a relevant setting for promoting healthy behaviors among adolescents. Future studies are, however, needed to confirm a possible causal relationship.","['crosssectional study', 'exercise', 'nutrition', 'risk behaviors', 'sports activities', 'youth']"
Mitigation of greenhouse gases in dairy cattle via genetic selection: 1. Genetic parameters of direct methane using noninvasive methods and proxies of methane.,"Records of methane emissions from 1,501 cows on 14 commercial farms in 4 regions of Spain were collected from May 2018 to June 2019. Methane concentrations (MeC) were measured using a nondispersive infrared methane detector installed within the feed bin of the automatic milking system during 14- to 21-d periods. Rumination time (RT; min/d) was collected using collars with a tag that registered time (minutes) spent eating and ruminating. The means of MeC and methane production (MeP) were 1,254.28 ppm and 182.49 g/d, respectively; mean RT was 473.38 min/d. Variance components for MeC, MeP, and RT were estimated with REML using pedigree and genomic information in a single-step model. Heritabilities for MeC and MeP were 0.11 and 0.12, respectively. Rumination time showed a slightly larger heritability estimate (0.17). The genetic correlation between MeP and MeC was high (>0.95), suggesting that selection on either trait would lead to a positive correlated response on the other. Negative correlations were estimated between RT and MeC (-0.24 ± 0.38) and MeP (-0.43 ± 0.35). Methane concentration and MeP had slightly positive correlations with milk yield (0.17 ± 0.39 and 0.21 ± 0.36), protein percentage (0.08 ± 0.32 and 0.30 ± 0.45), protein yield (0.22 ± 0.41 and 0.31 ± 0.35), fat percentage (0.02 ± 0.40 and 0.27 ± 0.36), and fat yield (0.27 ± 0.28 and 0.29 ± 0.28) from bivariate analyses. Rumination time had positive correlations with milk yield (0.41 ± 0.75) and protein yield (0.26 ± 0.57) and negative correlations with fat yield (-0.45 ± 0.32), protein percentage (-0.15 ± 0.38), and fat percentage (-0.40 ± 0.47). A positive approximated genetic correlation was estimated between fertility and MeC (0.10 ± 0.05) and MeP (0.18 ± 0.05), resulting in slightly higher CH<sub>4</sub> production when selecting for better fertility [days open estimated breeding values (EBV) are expressed with mean 100 and SD 10, inversely related to days from calving to conception; that is, greater days open EBV implies better fertility]. Positive correlations were also estimated for stature with MeC and MeP (0.30 ± 0.04 and 0.43 ± 0.04, respectively). Other type traits (chest width, udder depth, angularity, and capacity) were positively correlated with methane traits, possibly because of higher milk yield and higher feed intake from these animals. Rumination time showed positive EBV correlations with production traits and type traits, and negative correlations with somatic cell count and body condition score. Based on the genetic correlations and heritabilities estimated in this study, methane is measurable and heritable, and estimates of genetic correlations suggest no strong opposition to current breeding objectives in Spanish Holsteins.","['Holstein', 'genetic parameter', 'methane', 'proxies', 'rumination time']"
Mortality and Major Morbidity of Very-Low-Birth-Weight Infants in Germany 2008-2012: A Report Based on Administrative Data.,"Expectant parents of very preterm infants, physicians, and policy makers require estimates for chances of survival and survival without morbidity. Such estimates should derive from a large, reliable, and contemporary data base of easily available items known at birth.To determine short-term outcome and risk factors in very-low-birth-weight preterm infants based on administrative data.Anonymized routine data sets transmitted from hospital administrations to statutory health insurance companies were used to assess survival and survival free of major morbidities in a large cohort of preterm infants in Germany.After exclusion of infants with lethal malformations, there were 13,147 infants with a birth weight below 1,500 g admitted to neonatal care 2008-2012, of whom 1,432 infants (10.9%) died within 180 days. Estimated 180 days survival probabilities were 0.632 (95% confidence interval 0.583-0.677) for infants with 250-499 g birth weight, 0.817 (0.799-0.834) for 500-749 g, 0.931 (0.920-0.940) for 750-999 g, 0.973 (0.967-0.979) for 1,000-1,249 g, and 0.985 (0.981-0.988) for 1,250-1,499 g. Estimated probabilities for survival without major morbidity (surgically treated intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, intestinal perforation, or retinopathy) were 0.433 (0.384-0.481) for 250-499 g, 0.622 (0.600-0.643) for 500-749 g, 0.836 (0.821-0.849) for 750-999 g, 0.938 (0.928-0.946) for 1,000-1,249 g, and 0.969 (0.964-0.974) for 1,250-1,499 g, respectively. Prediction of survival and survival without major morbidities was moderately improved by adding sex, small for gestational age, and severe or moderate congenital malformation, increasing receiver operating characteristic areas under the curve from 0.839 (0.827-0.850) to 0.862 (0.852-0.874) (survival) and from 0.827 (0.822-0.842) to 0.852 (0.846-0.863) (survival without major morbidities), respectively.The present analysis encourages attempts to use administrative data to investigate the association between risk factors and outcome in preterm infants.","['morbidity', 'mortality', 'predictive power', 'preterm infant', 'risk factor']"
Network Meta-analysis of Progression-Free Survival and Overall Survival in First-Line Treatment of BRAF Mutation-Positive Metastatic Melanoma.,"The present study aimed to inform an economic evaluation of dabrafenib and trametinib combination as first-line treatment of metastatic melanoma in a Canadian setting. A network meta-analysis was conducted to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for progression-free survival (PFS)and overall survival (OS) of dabrafenib plus trametinib versus other first-line treatments of BRAF mutation-positive metastatic melanoma including dabrafenib, trametinib, vemurafenib, ipilimumab, and dacarbazine (DTIC).HRs for PFS and OS were from randomized controlled trials identified from systematic literature reviews. HRs for PFS and OS (adjusted for crossover as appropriate) were analyzed using multivariate and univariate Bayesian network meta-analysis.In multivariate network-meta analyses (HRs for PFS and OS estimated simultaneously to account for the correlation of treatment effects on PFS and OS), HRs (95% credible interval) for PFS and OS favored dabrafenib plus trametinib [PFS: 0.23 (0.18-0.29) versus DTIC, 0.32 (0.24-0.42) versus ipilimumab plus DTIC, 0.52 (0.32-0.83) versus trametinib, 0.57 (0.48-0.69) versus vemurafenib, and 0.59 (0.50-0.71) versus dabrafenib]; OS [0.41 (0.29-0.56) versus DTIC, 0.52 (0.38-0.71) versus ipilimumab plus DTIC, 0.68 (0.47-0.95) versus trametinib, 0.69 (0.57-0.84) versus vemurafenib, and 0.72 (0.60-0.85) versus dabrafenib]. The beneficial effects on OS of dabrafenib plus trametinib versus ipilimumab plus DTIC and versus trametinib were attenuated when HRs were estimated using univariate network meta-analysis (HRs for PFS and OS estimated separately).This analysis demonstrates improved PFS and OS with dabrafenib + trametinib versus dabrafenib, trametinib, vemurafenib, ipilimumab plus DTIC, and DTIC as first-line treatment for patients with BRAF mutation-positive metastatic melanoma.Novartis Pharmaceuticals.","['Clinical trials', 'Melanoma', 'Network metaanalysis']"
"Tang Luo Ning, a Traditional Chinese Compound Prescription, Ameliorates Schwannopathy of Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy Rats by Regulating Mitochondrial Dynamics <i>In Vivo</i> and <i>In Vitro</i>.","Tang Luo Ning (TLN), a traditional Chinese compound prescription, has been used clinically to treat diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in China. However, the exact mechanisms remain unclear. The objective of this study is to unravel the effects of TLN on mitochondrial dynamics of DPN in streptozotocin-induced rat models and Schwann cells cultured in 150 mM glucose. Mitochondrial function was determined by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ATP levels of streptozotocin (STZ)-induced DPN rats and mitochondria structure, mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), and mtDNA of high glucose incubated SCs. Mitochondrial dynamics protein including mitofusin 1 (Mfn1), mitofusin 2 (Mfn2), optic atrophy 1 (Opa1), and dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) were investigated using Western blot or immunofluorescence. Myelin basic protein (MBP), myelin protein zero (MPZ), and sex-determining region Y (SRY)-box 10 (Sox10) were measured to represent schwannopathy. Our results showed that TLN increased ATP levels (0.38 of model, 0.69 of HTLN, 0.61 of LTLN, <i>P</i>＜0.01; 0.52 of 150 mM glucose, 1.00 of 10% TLN, <i>P</i>＜0.01, 0.94 of 1% TLN, <i>P</i>＜0.05), MMP (0.56 of 150 mM glucose, <i>P</i>＜0.01, 0.75 of 10% TLN, <i>P</i>＜0.05, 0.83 of 1% TLN, <i>P</i>＜0.01), and mtDNA (0.32 of 150 mM glucose, 0.43 of 10% TLN, <i>P</i>＜0.01) while decreased Ca<sup>2+</sup> (1.54 of model, 1.06 of HTLN, 0.96 of LTLN, <i>P</i>＜0.01) to improve mitochondrial function <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. TLN helps maintain balance of mitochondrial dynamics: it reduces the mitochondria number (1.60 of 150 mM glucose, 1.10 of 10% TLN, <i>P</i>＜0.01) and increases the mitochondria coverage (0.51 of 150 mM glucose, 0.80 of 10% TLN, 0.87 of 1% TLN, <i>P</i>＜0.01), mitochondrial network size (0.51 of 150 mM glucose, 0.95 of 10% TLN, 0.94 of 1% TLN, <i>P</i>＜0.01), and branch length (0.63 of 150 mM glucose, <i>P</i>＜0.01, 0.73 of 10% TLN, <i>P</i>＜0.05, 0.78 of 1% TLN, <i>P</i>＜0.01).

Additionally, TLN improved schwannopathy by increasing MBP (0.50 of model, 1.05 of HTLN, 0.94 of HTLN, <i>P</i>＜0.01; 0.60 of 150 mM glucose, 0.78 of 10% TLN, <i>P</i>＜0.01, 0.72 of 1% TLN, <i>P</i>＜0.05), Sox101 (0.41 of model, 0.99 of LTLN, <i>P</i>＜0.01; 0.48 of 150 mM glucose, 0.65 of 10% TLN, <i>P</i>＜0.05, 0.69 of 1% TLN, <i>P</i>＜0.01), and MPZ (0.48 of model, 0.66 of HTLN, 0.55 of HTLN, <i>P</i>＜0.01; 0.60 of 150 mM glucose, 0.78 of 10% TLN, <i>P</i>＜0.01, 0.75 of 1% TLN, <i>P</i>＜0.05) expressions. In conclusion, our study indicated that TLN's function on DPN may link to the improvement of the mitochondrial dynamics, which provides scientific evidence for the clinical application.","['Drp1', 'Mfn1', 'Mfn2', 'OPA1', 'Schwann cells', 'diabetic peripheral neuropathy', 'mitochondrial dynamics']"
Color light-emitting diode reflection topography: validation of keratometric repeatability in a large sample of wide cylindrical-range corneas.,"To investigate repeatability of steep and flat keratometry measurements, as well as astigmatism axis in cohorts with normal range and regular astigmatic such as: eyes following laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) and normal population, as well as cohorts of high and irregular astigmatism such as keratoconic eyes, and keratoconic eyes following corneal collagen cross-linking, employing a novel corneal reflection topography device.Steep and flat keratometry and astigmatism axis measurement repeatability was investigated employing a novel multicolored-spot reflection topographer (Cassini) in four study groups, namely a post myopic LASIK-treated Group A, a keratoconus Group B, a post-CXL keratoconus Group C, and a control Group D of routine healthy patients. Three separate, maps were obtained employing the Cassini, enabling investigation of the intra-individual repeatability by standard deviation. Additionally we investigated in all groups,the Klyce surface irregularity indices for keratoconus, the SAI (surface asymmetry index) and the SRI (surface regularity index).Flat keratometry repeatability was 0.74±0.89 (0.03 to 5.26) diopters (D) in the LASIK Group A, 0.88±1.45 (range minimum to maximum, 0.00 to 7.84) D in the keratoconic Group B, and 0.71±0.94 (0.02 to 6.23) D in the cross-linked Group C. The control Group D had flat keratometry repeatability 0.36±0.46 (0.00 to 2.71) D. Steep keratometry repeatability was 0.64±0.82 (0.01 to 4.81) D in the LASIK Group A, 0.89±1.22 (0.02 to 7.85) D in the keratoconic Group B, and 0.93±1.12 (0.04 to 5.93) D in the cross-linked Group C. The control Group D had steep keratometry repeatability 0.41±0.50 (0.00 to 3.51) D. Axis repeatability was 3.45±1.62° (0.38 to 7.78°) for the LASIK Group A, 4.12±3.17° (0.02 to 12.13°) for the keratoconic Group B, and 3.20±1.99° (0.17 to 8.61°) for the cross-linked Group C. The control Group D had axis repeatability 2.16±1.39° (0.05 to 5.86°). The SAI index measurement repeatability was 0.33±0.40 (0.01 to 2.31) in the post-LASIK Group A, 0.39±0.75 (0.00 to 7.15) in the keratoconic Group B, and 0.43±0.56 (0.05 to 3.50) in the keratoconus post-CXL Group C. The control group had SAI measurement repeatability of 0.26±0.30 (0.00 to 2.39). The SRI index repeatability was 0.22±0.17 (0.01 to 0.96) for post-LASIK Group A, 0.20±0.18 (0.00 to 1.07) in keratoconic Group B, and 0.13±0.09 (0.00 to 0.45) in the keratoconus post-CXL Group C. The control Group D had SRI measurement repeatability of 0.23±0.16 (0.00 to 0.75).This novel corneal topography device appears to offer very high specificity in estimating corneal keratometry and specific corneal irregularity indices, even in topographically challenging corneas such as LASIK treated, keratoconic, and cross-linked.","['Cassini topographer', 'LED topography', 'VU topographer', 'axis of astigmatism', 'form factor', 'pointsource topography', 'steep meridian', 'surface asymmetry index', 'surface regularity index']"
Glycated Hemoglobin is a Better Predictor than Fasting Glucose for Cardiometabolic Risk in Non-diabetic Korean Women.,"This study aimed to investigate if glycated hemoglobin (HgbA1C) as compared to fasting blood glucose is better for reflecting cardiometabolic risk in non-diabetic Korean women. Fasting glucose, HgbA1C and lipid profiles were measured in non-diabetic women without disease (n = 91). The relationships of fasting glucose or HgbA1C with anthropometric parameters, lipid profiles, and liver and kidney functions were analyzed. Both fasting glucose and HgbA1C were negatively correlated with HDL-cholesterol (r = -0.287, p = 0.006; r = -0.261, p = 0.012), and positively correlated with age (r = 0.202, p = 0.008; r = 0.221, p = 0.035), waist circumference (r = 0.296, p = 0.005; r = 0.304, p = 0.004), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (r = 0.206, p = 0.050; r = 0.225, p = 0.032), aspartate transaminase (AST) (r = 0.237, p = 0.024; r = 0.368, p < 0.0001), alanine transaminase (ALT) (r = 0.296, p = 0.004; r = 0.356, p = 0.001), lipid profiles including triglyceride (r = 0.372, p < 0.001; r = 0.208, p = 0.008), LDL-cholesterol (r = 0.315, p = 0.002; r = 0.373, p < 0.0001) and total cholesterol (r = 0.310, p = 0.003; r = 0.284, p = 0.006). When adjusted for age and body mass index, significant relationships of DBP (r = 0.190, p = 0.049), AST (r = 0.262, p = 0.018), ALT (r = 0.277, p = 0.012), and HDL-cholesterol (r = -0.202, p = 0.049) with HgbA1C were still retained, but those with fasting glucose disappeared. In addition, the adjusted relationships of LDL-cholesterol and total cholesterol with HgbA1C were much greater than those with fasting glucose. These results suggest that glycated hemoglobin may be a better predictor than fasting glucose for cardiometabolic risk in non-diabetic Korean women.","['Cardiometabolic risk', 'Fasting glucose', 'Glycated hemoglobin', 'Lipid profile']"
Developmental aspects of cortical excitability and inhibition in depressed and healthy youth: an exploratory study.,"The objective of this post-hoc exploratory analysis was to examine the relationship between age and measures of cortical excitability and inhibition.Forty-six participants (24 with major depressive disorder and 22 healthy controls) completed MT, SICI, ICF, and CSP testing in a cross-sectional protocol. Of these 46 participants, 33 completed LICI testing. Multiple linear robust regression and Spearman partial correlation coefficient were used to examine the relationship between age and the TMS measures.In the overall sample of 46 participants, age had a significant negative relationship with motor threshold (MT) in both the right (r s = -0.49, adjusted p = 0.007; β = -0.08, adjusted p = 0.001) and left (r s = -0.42, adjusted p = 0.029; β = -0.05, adjusted p = 0.004) hemispheres. This significant negative relationship of age with MT was also observed in the sample of depressed youth in both the right (r s = -0.70, adjusted p = 0.002; β = -0.09, adjusted p = 0.001) and left (r s = -0.54, adjusted p = 0.034; β = -0.05, adjusted p = 0.017) hemispheres, but not in healthy controls. In the sample of the 33 participants who completed LICI testing, age had a significant negative relationship with LICI (200 ms interval) in both the right (r s = -0.48, adjusted p = 0.05; β = -0.24, adjusted p = 0.007) and left (r s = -0.64, adjusted p = 0.002; β = -0.23, adjusted p = 0.001) hemispheres. This negative relationship between age and LICI (200 ms interval) was also observed in depressed youth in both the right (r s = -0.76, adjusted p = 0.034; β = -0.35, adjusted p = 0.004) and left (r s = -0.92, adjusted p = 0.002; β = -0.25, adjusted p = 0.001) hemispheres.These findings suggest that younger children have higher MTs. This is more pronounced in depressed youth than healthy controls. LICI inhibition may also increase with age in youth.","['CSP', 'ICF', 'LICI', 'SICI', 'TMS', 'adolescents', 'depression', 'neurodevelopment']"
Red and processed meat intake and risk of cardiovascular disease: A two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Previous observational studies have yielded inconsistent findings regarding associations between red/processed meat intake and the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Some studies have suggested positive relationships, while others have demonstrated no significant associations. However, causal effects remain uncertain. This 2023 Mendelianrandomization (MR) study investigated the causal relationship between red and processed meat (porkmeat, mutton meat, beef meat)intake and CVD risk by analyzing summary data from the UK Biobank (exposure), CARDIoGRAMplusC4D (coronary artery disease [CAD]), MEGASTROKE (stroke), Nielsen et al. (atrial fibrillation [AF]), HERMES (heart failure [HF]), and FinnGen (cardiovascular outcomes) public databases.Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of red meat (pork, beef, and mutton) and processed meat were sourced from the United Kingdom (UK) Biobank. GWAS data on CVD for this study were obtained from the Gene and FinnGen consortia. The primary method employed for the two-sample MR analysis was inverse variance weighting (IVW). Sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the reliability and consistency of the results.Genetically predicted red and processed meat consumption did not demonstrate a causal association with any CVD outcomes when employing the IVW method. For processed meat intake, the odds ratios (ORs) (95% confidence intervals CIs) in large consortia were as follows: 0.88 (0.56-1.39) for CAD, 0.91 (0.65-1.27) for AF, 0.84 (0.58-1.21) for HF, and 1.00 (0.75-1.05) for stroke. In FinnGen, the ORs were as follows: 1.15 (0.83-1.59) for CAD, 1.25 (0.75-2.07) for AF, 1.09 (0.73-1.64) for HF, and 1.27 (0.85-1.91) for stroke. For beef intake, the ORs (95% CIs) in large consortia were as follows: 0.70 (0.28-1.73) for CAD, 0.85 (0.49-1.49) for AF, 0.80 (0.35-1.83) for HF, and 1.29 (0.85-1.95) for stroke. In FinnGen, the ORs were as follows: 2.01 (0.75-5.39) for CAD, 1.83 (0.60-5.56) for AF, 0.80 (0.30-2.13) for HF, and 1.30 (0.62-2.73) for stroke. For pork intake, the ORs (95% CIs) in large consortia were as follows: 1.25 (0.37-4.22) for CAD, 1.26 (0.73-2.15) for AF, 1.71 (0.86-3.39) for HF, and 1.15 (0.63-2.11) for stroke. In FinnGen, the ORs were as follows: 1.12 (0.43-2.88) for CAD, 0.39 (0.08-1.83) for AF, 0.62 (0.20-1.88) for HF, and 0.60 (0.21-1.65) for stroke. For mutton intake, the ORs (95% CIs) in large consortia were as follows: 0.84 (0.48-1.44) for CAD, 0.84 (0.56-1.26) for AF, 1.04 (0.65-1.67) for HF, and 1.06 (0.77-1.45) for stroke. In FinnGen, the ORs were as follows: 1.20 (0.65-2.21) for CAD, 0.92 (0.44-1.92) for AF, 0.74 (0.34-1.58) for HF, and 0.75 (0.45-1.24) for stroke. The results remained robust and consistent in both the meta-analysis and supplementary MR analysis.This MR study demonstrated no significant causal relationships between red/processed meat intake and the risk of the four CVD outcomes examined. Further investigation is warranted to confirm these findings.","['Beef meat', 'Cardiovascular disease', 'Mendelian randomization', 'Mutton meat', 'Pork meat', 'Processed meat', 'Red meat']"
Efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant immunotherapy protocols and cycles for non-small cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This study evaluated the use of different neoadjuvant immunotherapy cycles and regimens for non-small cell lung cancer.Databases were searched for articles published up until December 2023. Data on the major pathologic response (MPR), complete pathologic response (pCR), radiological response, treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), surgical resection, surgical complications, R0 resection, and conversion to thoracotomy were collected. A subgroup analysis was performed according to the treatment regimens and cycles. Stata/MP software was used for statistical analyses.In total, 2430 individuals were assessed from 44 studies. Compared with those following neoadjuvant immunotherapy alone (MPR/pCR/TRAEs/SAEs: ES=0.26/0.07/0.43/0.08, 95% CI: 0.18-0.34/0.04-0.10/0.28-0.58/0.04-0.14), the MPR and pCR rates, incidence of TRAEs and SAEs following neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy increased significantly (MPR/pCR/TRAEs/SAEs: ES=0.55/0.34/0.81/0.22, 95% CI: 0.48-0.63/0.28-0.41/0.69-0.90/0.13-0.33, P=0.001/0.002/0.009/0.034). No significant differences were found in the surgical resection, surgical complications, R0 resection, or conversion to thoracotomy. In the chemoimmunotherapy group, no statistically significant differences were found in the MPR and pCR rates, incidence of TRAEs and SAEs in the two-cycle, three-cycle and four-cycle groups (MPR/pCR/TRAEs/SAEs: ES=0.50;0.70;0.36/0.32;0.49;0.18/0.95;0.85;0.95/0.34;0.27;0.37, P=0.255/0.215/0.253/0.848). In the ICIs group, there was little change in the MPR and pCR rates, incidence of TRAEs and SAEs in the two-cycle group compared to the three-cycle group. (MPR/pCR/TRAEs/SAEs: ES=0.28;0.20/0.06;0.08/0.45;0.35/0.10;0.02, P=0.696/0.993/0.436/0.638). The neoadjuvant treatment cycle had no significant effect on surgical resection, surgical complications, R0 resection, or conversion to thoracotomy in both regimens.Neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy significantly increased the rate of tumor pathological remission compared to neoadjuvant immunotherapy alone but also increased the incidence of TRAEs and SAEs. The efficacy and safety of neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy are found to be favorable when administered for a duration of three cycles, in comparison to both two and four cycles.https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/#recordDetails, identifier CRD42023407415.","['lung cancer', 'major pathologic response', 'metaanalysis', 'neoadjuvant cycle', 'preoperative immunotherapy', 'treatment regimens']"
Influence of Sumac Extract on the Physico-chemical Properties and Oxidative Stability of Some Cold Pressed Citrus Seed Oils.,"The acidity values changed between 1.03 mgKOH/100g (control) and 1.11 mgKOH/100g (0.1% extract) for orange oil, 1.06 mgKOH/100g (0.5% extract) and 1.13 mgKOH/100g (0.1% extract) and 1.25 mgKOH/100g (0.5% extract) and 1.31 mgKOH/100g (control) for mandarin oil. The peroxide values were determined between1.37 meqO<sub>2</sub>/kg (0.5% extract) and 1.43 meqO<sub>2</sub>/kg (0.1% extract) for orange oil, between 1.24 meqO<sub>2</sub>/kg (control) and 1.27 meqO<sub>2</sub>/kg (0.1% extract) for lemon and 1.60 meqO<sub>2</sub>/kg (0.5% extract) and 1.71 meqO<sub>2</sub>/kg (control) in mandarin oil samples.

Interobserver reliability of the 'Welfare Quality(®) Animal Welfare Assessment Protocol for Growing Pigs'.,"The present paper focuses on evaluating the interobserver reliability of the 'Welfare Quality(®) Animal Welfare Assessment Protocol for Growing Pigs'. The protocol for growing pigs mainly consists of a Qualitative Behaviour Assessment (QBA), direct behaviour observations (BO) carried out by instantaneous scan sampling and checks for different individual parameters (IP), e.g. presence of tail biting, wounds and bursitis. Three trained observers collected the data by performing 29 combined assessments, which were done at the same time and on the same animals; but they were carried out completely independent of each other. The findings were compared by the calculation of Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficients (RS), Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC), Smallest Detectable Changes (SDC) and Limits of Agreements (LoA). There was no agreement found concerning the adjectives belonging to the QBA (e.g. active: RS: 0.50, ICC: 0.30, SDC: 0.38, LoA: -0.05 to 0.45; fearful: RS: 0.06, ICC: 0.0, SDC: 0.26, LoA: -0.20 to 0.30). In contrast, the BO showed good agreement (e.g. social behaviour: RS: 0.45, ICC: 0.50, SDC: 0.09, LoA: -0.09 to 0.03 use of enrichment material: RS: 0.75, ICC: 0.68, SDC: 0.06, LoA: -0.03 to 0.03). Overall, observers agreed well in the IP, e.g. tail biting (RS: 0.52, ICC: 0.88; SDC: 0.05, LoA: -0.01 to 0.02) and wounds (RS: 0.43, ICC: 0.59, SDC: 0.10, LoA: -0.09 to 0.10). The parameter bursitis showed great differences (RS: 0.10, ICC: 0.0, SDC: 0.35, LoA: -0.37 to 0.40), which can be explained by difficulties in the assessment when the animals moved around quickly or their legs were soiled. In conclusion, the interobserver reliability was good in the BO and most IP, but not for the parameter bursitis and the QBA.","['Animal welfare assessment', 'Animalbased', 'Interobserver reliability', 'Pig', 'Welfare Quality®']"
Effect of Phosphorylated-Extracellular Regulated Kinase 1/2 Inhibitor on Retina from Light-induced Photoreceptor Degeneration.,"The demonstrated role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in both cell apoptosis and the inflammation pathway makes it an attractive target for photoreceptor protection. The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effects of MAPK antagonists against photoreceptor degeneration and retinal inflammation in a rat model of light-induced retinal degeneration.Sprague Dawley rats were treated with intravitreal injections of MAPK antagonists, inhibitors of p-P38, phosphorylated-extracellular regulated kinase (p-ERK) 1/2, and p-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) just before they were assigned to dark adaptation. After dark adaptation for 24 h, rats were exposed to blue light (2500 lux) in a light box for 24 h, and then returned to the normal 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. Samples were collected at different time points. MAPK expression during light exposure was examined with immunofluorescence. Photoreceptor death was detected with histopathology and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) staining. The expression of retinal p-ERK1/2, caspase 3, activated caspase 3, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and interleukin (IL)-1β was examined by Western blotting. Differences between groups were evaluated using unpaired one-way analysis of variance and least significant difference post hoc tests.MAPKs (P38, ERK1/2, and p-JNK) were phosphorylated and activated in the light injury groups, compared with normal group, and their expressions were mainly elevated in the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Among the selected MAPK antagonists, only the p-ERK1/2 inhibitor attenuated the loss of photoreceptors and the thinning of ONL in light injury groups. Besides, p-ERK1/2 inhibitor refrained light-induced photoreceptor apoptosis, which was presented by TUNEL positive cells. Light injury significantly increased the expression of p-ERK1/2 (1.12 ± 0.06 vs. 0.57 ± 0.08, t = 9.99, P < 0.05; 1.23 ± 0.03 vs. 0.57 ± 0.08, t = 11.90, P < 0.05; and 1.12 ± 0.12 vs. 0.57 ± 0.08, t = 9.86, P < 0.05; F = 49.55, P < 0.001), and induced caspase 3 activating (0.63 ± 0.06 vs. 0.14 ± 0.05, t = 13.67, P < 0.05; 0.74 ± 0.05 vs. 0.14 ± 0.05, t = 16.87, P < 0.05; and 0.80 ± 0.05 vs. 0.14 ± 0.05, t = 18.57, P < 0.05; F = 100.15, P < 0.001), compared with normal group. The p-ERK1/2 inhibitor significantly reduced p-ERK1/2 overexpression (0.61 ± 0.06 vs. 1.12 ± 0.06, t = -9.26, P < 0.05; 0.77 ± 0.06 vs. 1.23 ± 0.03, t = -8.29, P < 0.05; and 0.68 ± 0.03 vs. 1.12 ± 0.12, t = -7.83, P < 0.05; F = 49.55, P < 0.001) and downregulated caspase 3 activating (0.23 ± 0.04 vs. 0.63 ± 0.06, t = -11.24, P < 0.05; 0.43 ± 0.03 vs. 0.74 ± 0.05, t = -8.86, P < 0.05; and 0.58 ± 0.03 vs. 0.80 ± 0.05, t = -6.17, P < 0.05; F = 100.15, P < 0.001), compared with light injury group. No significant change in the total level of caspase 3 was seen in different groups (F = 0.56, P = 0.75). As for inflammation, light injury significantly increased the expression of TNF-α (0.42 ± 0.04 vs. 0.25 ± 0.05, t = 5.99, P < 0.05; 0.65 ± 0.03 vs. 0.25 ± 0.05, t = 14.87, P < 0.05; and 0.86 ± 0.04 vs. 0.25 ± 0.05, t = 22.58, P < 0.05; F = 160.27, P < 0.001) and IL-1β (0.24 ± 0.01 vs. 0.19 ± 0.02, t = 2.33, P < 0.05; 0.35 ± 0.02 vs. 0.19 ± 0.02, t = 7.97, P < 0.05; and 0.48 ± 0.04 vs. 0.19 ± 0.02, t = 14.69, P < 0.05; F = 77.29, P < 0.001), compared with normal group. P-ERK1/2 inhibitor significantly decreased the overexpression of TNF-α (0.22 ± 0.02 vs. 0.42 ± 0.04, t = -7.40, P < 0.05; 0.27 ± 0.02 vs. 0.65 ± 0.03, t = -14.27, P < 0.05; and 0.33 ± 0.03 vs. 0.86 ± 0.04, t = -19.58, P < 0.05; F = 160.27, P < 0.001) and IL-1β (0.13 ± 0.03 vs. 0.24 ± 0.01, t = -5.77, P < 0.05; 0.17 ± 0.01 vs. 0.22 ± 0.02, t = -9.18, P < 0.05; and 0.76 ± 0.05 vs. 0.48 ± 0.04, t = -13.12, P < 0.05; F = 77.29, P < 0.001), compared with light injury group.The p-ERK1/2 inhibitor might protect the retina from light-induced photoreceptor degeneration and retinal inflammation.","['Apoptosis', 'Inflammation', 'Retinal Degeneration']"
Associations of Triglycerides and Atherogenic Index of Plasma with Brain Structure in the Middle-Aged and Elderly Adults.,"Triglyceride (TG) and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) have been acknowledged to be risk factors for vascular insults, but their impacts on the brain system remain elusive. To fill in some gaps, we investigated associations of TG and AIP with brain structure, leveraging the UK Biobank database. TG and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) were examined at baseline and AIP was calculated as log (TG/HDL-C). We build several linear regression models to estimate associations of TG and AIP with volumes of brain grey matter phenotypes. Significant inverse associations of TG and AIP with volumes of specific subcortical traits were observed, among which TG and AIP were most significantly associated with caudate nucleus (TG: β [95% confidence interval CI] = -0.036 [-0.051, -0.022], AIP: -0.038 [-0.053, -0.023]), thalamus (-0.029 [-0.042, -0.017], -0.032 [-0.045, -0.019]). Higher TG and AIP were also considerably related with reduced cortical structure volumes, where two most significant associations of TG and AIP were with insula (TG: -0.035 [-0.048, -0.022], AIP: -0.038 [-0.052, -0.025]), superior temporal gyrus (-0.030 [-0.043, -0.017], -0.033 [-0.047, -0.020]). Modification effects of sex and regular physical activity on the associations were discovered as well. Our findings show adverse associations of TG and AIP with grey matter volumes, which has essential public health implications for early prevention in neurodegenerative diseases.","['atherogenic index of plasma', 'brain imaging trait', 'molecular epidemiology', 'triglyceride']"
[Investigation of the Correlation between Patient Characteristics and Contrast Enhancement during Hepatic Dynamic CT Scan: Comparison by the Sex].,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between patient characteristics and contrast enhancement during the hepatic arterial phase (HAP) and portal venous phase (PVP) CT scanning. All were examined using a hepatic dynamic CT protocol; the scanning parameters were tube voltage 120 kVp, tube current 50 to 600 mA (noise index 8.0 HU), 0.5-s rotation, 5-mm detector row width, 0.813 or 0.825 beam pitch, and the contrast material 600 mg/kg iodine. We calculated contrast enhancement (per gram of iodine: ΔHU/gI) of the abdominal aorta during the HAP and that of the hepatic parenchyma during the PVP. There was a significant difference in the contrast enhancement of the abdominal aorta during the HAP (8.6±2.7 ΔHU/gI) and (9.5±1.7 ΔHU/gI) and that of the hepatic parenchyma during the PVP (1.4±0.5 ΔHU/gI) and (2.9±0.5 ΔHU/gI) between male and female patients (p<0.05). A significant positive correlation was seen between the ΔHU/gI of aortic enhancement and age in male and female patients (r=-0.382 and 0.213) (p<0.05). A significant inverse correlation was observed between the ΔHU/gI of aortic enhancement and the height (HT; r=-0.466 and -0.251), total body weight (TBW; r=-0.609 and -0.535), body mass index (BMI; r=-0.505 and -0.465), lean body weight (LBW; r=-0.642 and -0.576), and body surface area (BSA; r=-0.644 and -0.557) (p<0.05 for all) in male and female patients. A significant positive correlation was seen between the ΔHU/gI of hepatic parenchymal enhancement and the patient age in male and female patients (r=0.258 and 0.150) (p<0.05). A significant inverse correlation was observed between the ΔHU/gI of hepatic parenchymal enhancement and the HT (r=-0.487 and -0.321), TBW (r=-0.580 and -0.525), BMI (r=-0.473 and -0.413), LBW (r=-0.615 and -0.576) (p<0.05 for all), and BSA (r=-0.617 and -0.558) in male and female patients. The BSA was significantly correlated with the ΔHU/gI of aortic and hepatic parenchymal enhancement of the hepatic dynamic CT in male patients. However, LBW was significantly correlated with the ΔHU/gI of aortic and hepatic parenchymal enhancement of the hepatic dynamic CT in female patients. Since the patient factors that affect the contrast enhancement of the abdominal aorta and hepatic parenchyma may differ from facility to facility, we should therefore consider reassessing at each facility.","['computed tomography CT', 'contrast enhancement', 'hepatic dynamic CT scan', 'patient characteristics']"
Genetic Parameter Estimates of Carcass Traits under National Scale Breeding Scheme for Beef Cattle.,"Carcass and price traits of 72,969 Hanwoo cows, bulls and steers aged 16 to 80 months at slaughter collected from 2002 to 2013 at 75 beef packing plants in Korea were analyzed to determine heritability, correlation and breeding value using the Multi-Trait restricted maximum likelihood (REML) animal model procedure. The traits included carcass measurements, scores and grades at 24 h postmortem and bid prices at auction. Relatively high heritability was found for maturity (0.41±0.031), while moderate heritability estimates were obtained for backfat thickness (0.20±0.018), longissimus muscle (LM) area (0.23±0.020), carcass weight (0.28±0.019), yield index (0.20±0.018), yield grade (0.16±0.017), marbling (0.28±0.021), texture (0.14±0.016), quality grade (0.26±0.016) and price/kg (0.24±0.025). Relatively low heritability estimates were observed for meat color (0.06±0.013) and fat color (0.06±0.012). Heritability estimates for most traits were lower than those in the literature. Genetic correlations of carcass measurements with characteristic scores or quality grade of carcass ranged from -0.27 to +0.21. Genetic correlations of yield grade with backfat thickness, LM area and carcass weight were 0.91, -0.43, and -0.09, respectively. Genetic correlations of quality grade with scores of marbling, meat color, fat color and texture were -0.99, 0.48, 0.47, and 0.98, respectively. Genetic correlations of price/kg with LM area, carcass weight, marbling, meat color, texture and maturity were 0.57, 0.64, 0.76, -0.41, -0.79, and -0.42, respectively. Genetic correlations of carcass price with LM area, carcass weight, marbling and texture were 0.61, 0.57, 0.64, and -0.73, respectively, with standard errors ranging from ±0.047 to ±0.058. The mean carcass weight breeding values increased by more than 8 kg, whereas the mean marbling scores decreased by approximately 0.2 from 2000 through 2009. Overall, the results suggest that genetic improvement of productivity and carcass quality could be obtained under the national scale breeding scheme of Korea for Hanwoo and that continuous efforts to improve the breeding scheme should be made to increase genetic progress.","['Carcass', 'Genetic Parameters', 'Genetic Progress', 'Hanwoo', 'National Breeding Scheme']"
"Socioeconomic Inequality of Non-Communicable Risk Factors among People Living in Kurdistan Province, Islamic Republic of Iran.","The most fundamental way to decrease the burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is to identify and control their related risk factors. The goal of this study is to determine socioeconomic inequalities in risk factors for NCDs using concentration index based on Non-Communicable Disease Surveillance Survey (NCDSS) data in Kurdistan province, Islamic Republic of Iran in 2005 and 2009.The required data for this study are taken from two NCDSSs in Kurdistan province in 2005 and 2009. A total of 2,494 persons in 2005 and 997 persons in 2009 were assessed. Concentration index was used to determine socioeconomic inequality. To assess the relationship between the prevalence of each risk factor and socioeconomic status (SES), logistic regression was used and odds ratio (OR) was calculated for each group, compared with the poorest group.The concentration index for hypertension was -0.095 (-0.158, -0.032) in 2005 and -0.080 (-0.156, -0.003) in 2009. The concentration index for insufficient consumption of fruits and vegetables was -0.117 (-0.153, -0.082) in 2005 and -0.100 (-0.153, -0.082) in 2009. The concentration index for the consumption of unhealthy fat and oil was -0.034 (-0.049, -0.019) in 2005 and -0.108 (-0.165, -0.051) in 2009. The concentration index for insufficient consumption of fish was -0.070 (-0.096, -0.044) in 2005. The concentration index for physical inactivity was 0.008 (-0.057, 0.075) in 2005 and 0.139 (0.063, 0.215) in 2009. In all the cases, the OR of the richest group to the poorest group was significant.Hypertension, insufficient consumption of fruits and vegetables, consumption of unhealthy fat and oil, and insufficient consumption of fish are more prevalent among poor groups. There was no significant socioeconomic inequality in the distribution of smoking, excess weight, and hypercholesterolemia. Physical inactivity was more prevalent among the rich groups of society in 2009. The reduction of socioeconomic inequalities must become a main goal in health-care policies.","['Concentration index', 'Iran', 'inequality', 'non communicable diseases', 'socioeconomic status']"
Vigorous Physical Activity Is Associated With Better Glycated Hemoglobin and Lower Fear of Hypoglycemia Scores in Youth With Type 1 Diabetes: A 2-Year Follow-Up Study.,"To correlate glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and fear of hypoglycemia scores with physical activity (PA) levels in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes (T1D) over a period of 2 years. Twenty-eight children and 33 adolescents with T1D have been assessed for their PA profile. Personal and medical data for the patients were collected at baseline (visit 0: V0), 1 year later (V1), and 2 years later (V2). At baseline, children with T1D engaged in less moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) (<i>p</i> < 0.01) per day than adolescents. These results did not differ across visits. On the contrary, adolescents spent fewer time in vigorous physical activity (VPA) (<i>p</i> < 0.01) than children did (<i>p</i> < 0.01). Fear of hypoglycemia scores correlated significantly with VPA levels (β = -0.41, <i>p</i> = 0.03; β = -0.44, <i>p</i> = 0.06; β = -0.61, <i>p</i> = 0.001). For HbA1c (%), significant correlations were reported with VPA levels (β = -0.54, <i>p</i> = 0.02; β = -0.47, <i>p</i> = 0.03; β = -0.62, <i>p</i> = 0.01) across visits. Body mass index percentile correlated with total screen time (β = 0.28, <i>p</i> = 0.02; β = 0.29, <i>p</i> = 0.01; β = 0.31, <i>p</i> = 0.04) and overall PA levels (β = -0.52, <i>p</i> = 0.02; β = -0.42, <i>p</i> = 0.03; β = -0.42, <i>p</i> = 0.01). Performing more vigorous PA a day is associated with better HbA1c with lower perceived fear of hypoglycemia among youth with T1D. Therefore, dedicating more time in VPA may be an appropriate advice for patients with T1D.","['adolescent', 'children', 'fear of hypoglycemia', 'followup', 'glycated hemoglobin', 'type 1 diabetes', 'vigorous physical activity']"

Whereas CT is currently a good performance in diagnosis of N stage, FDG PET/CT shows good accuracy in diagnosis of M stage.","['CT', 'FDG PETCT', 'MRI', 'Metaanalysis', 'nasopharyngeal carcinoma']"
"Explaining Personalized Activity Limitations in Patients With Hand and Wrist Disorders: Insights from Sociodemographic, Clinical, and Mindset Characteristics.","To investigate the association of sociodemographic, clinical, and mindset characteristics on outcomes measured with a patient-specific patient-reported outcome measure (PROM); the Patient Specific Functional Scale (PSFS). Secondly, we examined whether these factors differ when a fixed-item PROM, the Michigan Hand Outcome Questionnaire (MHQ), is used as an outcome.Cohort study, using the aforementioned groups of factors in a hierarchical linear regression.Twenty-six clinics for hand and wrist conditions in the Netherlands.Two samples of patients with various hand and wrist conditions and treatments: n=7111 (PSFS) and n=5872 (MHQ).NA.The PSFS and MHQ at 3 months.The PSFS exhibited greater between-subject variability in baseline, follow-up, and change scores than the MHQ. Better PSFS outcomes were associated with: no involvement in litigation (β[95% confidence interval=-0.40[-0.54;-0.25]), better treatment expectations (0.09[0.06;0.13]), light workload (0.08[0.03;0.14]), not smoking (-0.07[-0.13;-0.01]), men sex (0.07[0.02;0.12]), better quality of life (0.07[0.05;0.10]), moderate workload (0.06[0.00;0.13]), better hand satisfaction (0.05[0.02; 0.07]), less concern (-0.05[-0.08;-0.02]), less pain at rest (-0.04[-0.08;-0.00]), younger age (-0.04[-0.07;-0.01]), better comprehensibility (0.03[0.01;0.06]), better timeline perception (-0.03[-0.06;-0.01]), and better control (-0.02[-0.04;-0.00]). The MHQ model was highly similar but showed a higher R<sup>2</sup> than the PSFS model (0.41 vs 0.15), largely due to the R<sup>2</sup> of the baseline scores (0.23 for MHQ vs 0.01 for PSFS).Health care professionals can improve personalized activity limitations by addressing treatment expectations and illness perceptions, which affect PSFS outcomes. Similar factors affect the MHQ, but the baseline MHQ score has a stronger association with the outcome score than the PSFS. While the PSFS is better for individual patient evaluation, we found that it is difficult to explain PSFS outcomes based on baseline characteristics compared with the MHQ. Using both patient-specific and fixed-item instruments helps health care professionals develop personalized treatment plans that meet individual needs and goals.","['Hand', 'Outcome assessment', 'Patient Reported Outcome Measures', 'Patientcentered care']"
Benign and malignant breast lesions identification through the values derived from shear wave elastography: evidence for the meta-analysis.,"The analysis was aimed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of shear wave elastography (SWE) for malignant breast lesions through a meta-analysis.Related articles were searched in databases of Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane library. Overall sensitivity and specificity were analyzed with DerSimonian and Laird random effects model. Area under curve (AUC) with corresponding 95% confidence interval were also analyzed to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of SWE. <i>P</i> value < 0.05 predicted the significant heterogeneity between study. Sensitivity and publication bias were assessed as well.According to the inclusion criteria, 25 articles were selected. In the subgroup analysis, diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of SWE in Asian population were 0.84 (0.79-0.88) and 0.87 (0.84-0.90), respectively, while they were 0.92 (0.86-0.96) and 0.89 (0.84-0.92) in Caucasian population. The diagnostic accuracy of SWE was a little higher for Caucasians than for Asians (0.95 vs. 0.92). The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of virtual touch tissue quantification (VTTQ) were 0.85 (0.77-0.91) and 0.93 (0.88-0.96), respectively. It showed a little higher value in specificity and summary receiver operating curve (sROC) than that of SWE (0.93 vs. 0.87; 0.95 vs. 0.93). In addition, maximum stiffness exhibited higher detection sensitivity than that of mean stiffness (0.91 vs. 0.85).SWE serves as an accurate diagnostic technology for discriminating malignant and benign breast lesions.","['breast', 'diagnose', 'metaanalysis', 'shear wave elastography']"
"Circulating microparticles, protein C, free protein S and endothelial vascular markers in children with sickle cell anaemia.","Circulating microparticles (MP) have been described in sickle cell anaemia (SCA); however, their interaction with endothelial markers remains unclear. We investigated the relationship between MP, protein C (PC), free protein S (PS), nitric oxide (NO), endothelin-1 (ET-1) and adrenomedullin (ADM) in a large cohort of paediatric patients.A total of 111 children of African ethnicity with SCA: 51 in steady state; 15 in crises; 30 on hydroxyurea (HU) therapy; 15 on transfusion; 17 controls (HbAA) of similar age/ethnicity. MP were analysed by flow cytometry using: Annexin V (AV), CD61, CD42a, CD62P, CD235a, CD14, CD142 (tissue factor), CD201 (endothelial PC receptor), CD62E, CD36 (TSP-1), CD47 (TSP-1 receptor), CD31 (PECAM), CD144 (VE-cadherin). Protein C, free PS, NO, pro-ADM and C-terminal ET-1 were also measured.Total MP AV was lower in crisis (1.26×10(6) ml(-1); 0.56-2.44×10(6)) and steady state (1.35×10(6) ml(-1); 0.71-3.0×10(6)) compared to transfusion (4.33×10(6) ml(-1); 1.6-9.2×10(6), p<0.01). Protein C levels were significantly lower in crisis (median 0.52 IU ml(-1); interquartile range 0.43-0.62) compared with all other groups: HbAA (0.72 IU ml(-1); 0.66-0.82, p<0.001); HU (0.67 IU ml(-1); 0.58-0.77, p<0.001); steady state (0.63 IU ml(-1); 0.54-0.70, p<0.05) and transfusion (0.60 IU ml(-1); 0.54-0.70, p<0.05). In addition, levels were significantly reduced in steady state (0.63 IU ml(-1); 0.54-0.70) compared with HbAA (0.72 IU ml(-1); 0.66-0.80, p<0.01). PS levels were significantly higher in HbAA (0.85 IU ml(-1); 0.72-0.97) compared with crisis (0.49 IU ml(-1); 0.42-0.64, p<0.001), HU (0.65 IU ml(-1); 0.56-0.74, p<0.01) and transfusion (0.59 IU ml(-1); 0.47-0.71, p<0.01). There was also a significant difference in crisis patients compared with steady state (0.49 IU ml(-1); 0.42-0.64 vs. 0.68 IU ml(-1); 0.58-0.79, p<0.05). There was high correlation (R>0.9, p<0.05) between total numbers of AV-positive MP (MP AV) and platelet MP expressing non-activation platelet markers. There was a lower correlation between MP AV and MP CD62P (R=0.73, p<0.05) (platelet activation marker), and also a lower correlation between percentage of MP expressing CD201 (%MP CD201) and %MP CD14 (R=0.627, p<0.001). %MP CD201 was higher in crisis (11.6%) compared with HbAA (3.2%, p<0.05); %MP CD144 was higher in crisis (7.6%) compared with transfusion (2.1%, p<0.05); %CD14 (0.77%) was higher in crisis compared with transfusion (0.0%, p<0.05) and steady state (0.0%, p<0.01); MP CD14 was detectable in a higher number of samples (92%) in crisis compared with the rest (40%); %MP CD235a was higher in crisis (17.9%) compared with transfusion (8.9%), HU (8.7%) and steady state (9.9%, p<0.05); %CD62E did not differ significantly across the groups and CD142 was undetectable. Pro-ADM levels were raised in chest crisis: 0.38 nmol L(-1) (0.31-0.49) versus steady state: 0.27 nmol L(-1) (0.25-0.32; p<0.01) and control: 0.28 nmol L(-1) (0.27-0.31; p<0.01). CT-proET-1 levels were reduced in patients on HU therapy: 43.6 pmol L(-1) (12.6-49.6) versus control: 55.1 pmol L(-1) (45.2-63.9; p<0.05). NO levels were significantly lower in chest crisis (19.3 mmol L(-1) plasma; 10.7-19.9) compared with HU (22.2 mmol L(-1) plasma; 18.3-28.4; p<0.05), and HbSC (30.6 mmol L(-1) plasma; 20.8-39.5; p<0.05) and approach significance when compared with steady state (22.5mmol L(-1) plasma; 16.9-28.2; p=0.07).Protein C and free PS are reduced in crisis with lower numbers of platelet MP and higher percentage of markers of endothelial damage and of red cell origin. During chest crisis, ADM and ET-1 were elevated suggesting a role for therapy inhibiting ET-1 in chest crisis.","['adrenomedullin', 'endothelin1', 'microparticles', 'nitric oxide', 'protein C', 'protein S', 'sickle cell anaemia']"
Assessment of a modification of Brückner's test as a screening modality for anisometropia and strabismus.,"Current amblyopia screening methods are not cost effective.To evaluate the diagnostic capability of a modified Brückner test (MBT) for amblyopiogenic risk factors.We applied the MBT using the streak retinoscope to identify anisometropia and strabismus by noting an inter-ocular difference in movement and glow, from children who failed 6/9 Snellen on community vision screening, followed by comprehensive eye examination. STATISITICS: Data were analyzed by 2 × 2 tables for diagnostic test parameters (95% CI).From 7998 children vision-screened, 392 failed 6/9 VA and were referred. Since 34 failed to reach the centers, and 15 were excluded due to poor/ no glow, data from 343 was analyzed. The prevalence of anisometropia of 0.5D was 17%, of 1D was 11% and of strabismus 5%. For the MBT the accuracy was ≥ 90% (95%CI 89% to 97%) over the three outcomes. The sensitivity, specificity, NPV and +LR for anisometropia of 0.5D were: 0.57 (0.48, 0.64), 0.97 (0.95, 0.98), 0.92 (0.90, 0.93) and 18 (9.7, 35); for 1D: 0.74(0.60, 0.82), 0.95 (0.94, 0.97), 0.97 (0.95, 0.98) and 16 (9.3, 28); and for strabismus: 0.5 (0.32, 0.66), 0.98 (0.97, 0.98), 0.97 (0.96, 0.98) and 20 (9.1, 42).Our data suggests that the MBT is highly accurate and useful for ruling in anisometropia and strabismus in children who fail 6/9 Snellen. The MBT needs further validation, both by different care givers and on differing populations. It offers an affordable, portable, and clinically useful tool to detect anisometropia and strabismus. We suggest that performing an MBT prior to uniocular retinosocpy should be a routine practice.","['Amblyopia', 'diagnostic test', 'likelihood ratio', 'modified Brückner test', 'screening test']"
"Exposure to Emerging and Legacy Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in the Sixth Total Diet Study - China, 2016-2019.","Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent organic pollutants, which have multi-organ toxicity and potential health risk to humans.The most commonly detected PFASs in the Sixth China Total Diet Study (TDS) samples were perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUdA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and 9-chlorohexadecafluoro-3-oxanonane-1-sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA). The mean estimated weekly intakes (EWIs) of PFOA, PFOS, and 6:2 Cl-PFESA in the Sixth TDS were 2.17, 2.72, and 2.75 ng/kg body weight per week, respectively.The PFASs levels in some food category and dietary exposure still need to be continuously monitored, especially for 6:2 Cl-PFESA.","['Diet Study', 'Dietary Exposure', 'Polyfluoroalkyl Substances']"
"Assessment of ethnic inequalities in diagnostic coding of familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH): A cross-sectional database study in Lambeth, South London.","Differences in the perceived prevalence of familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) by ethnicity are unclear. In this study, we aimed to assess the prevalence, determinants and management of diagnostically-coded FH in an ethnically diverse population in South London.A cross-sectional analysis of 40 practices in 332,357 adult patients in Lambeth was undertaken. Factors affecting a (clinically coded) diagnosis of FH were investigated by multi-level logistic regression adjusted for socio-demographic and lifestyle factors, co-morbidities, and medications.The age-adjusted FH % prevalence rate (OR, 95%CI) ranged from 0.10 to 1.11, 0.00-1.31. Lower rates of FH coding were associated with age (0.96, 0.96-0.97) and male gender (0.75, 0.65-0.87), p < 0.001. Compared to a White British reference group, a higher likelihood of coded FH was noted in Other Asians (1.33, 1.01-1.76), p = 0.05, with lower rates in Black Africans (0.50, 0.37-0.68), p < 0.001, Indians (0.55, 0.34-0.89) p = 0.02, and in Black Caribbeans (0.60, 0.44-0.81), p = 0.001. The overall prevalence using Simon Broome criteria was 0.1%; we were unable to provide ethnic specific estimates due to low numbers. Lower likelihoods of FH coding (OR, 95%CI) were seen in non-native English speakers (0.66, 0.53-0.81), most deprived income quintile (0.68, 0.52-0.88), smokers (0.68,0.55-0.85), hypertension (0.62, 0.52-0.74), chronic kidney disease (0.64, 0.41-0.99), obesity (0.80, 0.67-0.95), diabetes (0.31, 0.25-0.39) and CVD (0.47, 0.36-0.63). 20% of FH coded patients were not prescribed lipid-lowering medications, p < 0.001.Inequalities in diagnostic coding of FH patients exist. Lower likelihoods of diagnosed FH were seen in Black African, Black Caribbean and Indian ethnic groups, in contrast to higher diagnoses in White and Other Asian ethnic groups. Hypercholesterolaemia requiring statin therapy was associated with FH diagnosis, however, the presence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors lowered the diagnosis rate for FH.","['Coding', 'Ethnicity', 'Familial hypercholesterolaemia', 'inequalities']"
A study of radiological scoring system evaluating extrapancreatic inflammation with conventional radiological and clinical scores in predicting outcomes in acute pancreatitis.,"A number of scoring systems are available to predict prognosis in acute pancreatitis (AP). The aim of the study was to compare extra-pancreatic inflammation on computed tomography (CT) (EPIC score) and renal rim sign with clinical scores (BISAP, SIRS) and conventional CT severity index (CTSI) and modified CTSI (MCTSI) in predicting persistent organ failure (POF), intervention and mortality.The demographic, clinical and radiographic data from patients with AP were retrospectively evaluated. The scores were evaluated by calculating receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the ROC (AUROC).Of the 105 patients (65 males; mean age 40.6±12.9 years) included, 8 died, 71 developed POF, and 16 needed intervention. The mean CTSI, MCTSI and EPIC scores were 5.8±3.0, 7.1±2.6 and 4.0±1.9 respectively. The AUROC for SIRS, BISAP, CTSI, MCTSI, Renal Rim Score and EPIC score in predicting POF were 0.65 (95%CI 0.53-0.78), 0.75 (95%CI 0.65-0.86), 0.66 (95%CI 0.54-0.78), 0.70 (95%CI 0.58-0.81), 0.64 (95%CI 0.52-0.76), 0.71 (95%CI 0.60-0.83), for radiological/endoscopic intervention were 0.50 (95%CI 0.35-0.65), 0.64 (95%CI 0.49-0.78), 0.51 (95%CI 0.36-0.66), 0.55 (95%CI 0.41-0.70), 0.51 (95%CI 0.36-0.67), 0.66 (95%CI 0.52-0.81), and for mortality 0.57 (95%CI 0.38-0.75), 0.90 (95%CI 0.83-0.97), 0.67 (95%CI 0.50-0.83), 0.68 (95%CI 0.51-0.85), 0.73 (95%CI 0.57-0.89) and 0.77 (95%CI 0.64-0.90) respectively.The prognostic performance of various clinical and radiological scoring systems in AP is comparable with BISAP having the highest accuracy for predicting POF and mortality.","['Computed tomography', 'acute pancreatitis', 'idiopathic pancreatitis', 'necrosis']"
"Impact of two COVID-19 lockdowns on HbA1c levels in patients with type 2 diabetes and associations with patient characteristics: a multicentre, observational cohort study over three years.","Glycemic effects of COVID-19 lockdowns on patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are controversial. In this long-term observation, we aimed (1) to analyze changes in HbA1c levels during lockdowns in Germany, and (2) to investigate whether diabetes medication, comorbidities, and sociodemographic data influenced these changes.This cohort study observed 1,089 patients aged ≥18 years over the years 2019 to 2021. Patients were recruited from 14 physicians specialized on diabetes. As dependent variable, 7,987 HbA1c values were analyzed by multivariable linear regression adjusted for random effects of physicians and patients.Patients had a median age of 68 (60/76) years and 623 (57.2%) were male. Before the pandemic, median HbA1c level (in %) was 6.9 (6.3/7.7). Average HbA1c level increased during first lockdown (0.21,0.11/0.31,<i>p</i> < 0.001), after first lockdown (0.23,0.18/0.28,<i>p</i> < 0.001), during second lockdown (0.40,0.33/0.47,<i>p</i> < 0.001) and after second lockdown (0.27,0.18/0.36,<i>p</i> < 0.001). The increase of HbA1c levels was more pronounced in male patients (0.08,0.01/0.15,<i>p</i> = 0.019), if patients did not have German as native language (0.12,0.01/0.23,<i>p</i> = 0.041) and if they were widowed (0.19,0.05/0.32,<i>p</i> = 0.008). End organ damages (0.12,0.01/0.23,<i>p</i> = 0.039), atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD; 0.23,0.10/0.36,<i>p</i> = 0.001) and cardiovascular events (0.25,0.10/0.40,p = 0.001) as well as oral medication (0.09,0.03/0.15,<i>p</i> = 0.002), intermediate- or long-acting insulins (0.24,0.16/0.32,<i>p</i> < 0.001), and fast-acting or mixed insulins (0.30,0.23/0.36,p < 0.001) were also related to a greater increase in HbA1c levels.Both lockdowns resulted in a significant increase in HbA1c levels. In particular, patients with ASCVD, cardiovascular events, and insulin therapy appear to be at risk for worsening glycemic control in crisis and thus require special medical attention.ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04821921).","['COVID19 lockdown', 'HbA1c', 'atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease', 'glycemic control', 'insulin treatment']"
The spreading frontiers of avian-human influenza described by the free boundary.,"In this paper, a reaction-diffusion system is proposed to investigate avian-human influenza. Two free boundaries are introduced to describe the spreading frontiers of the avian influenza. The basic reproduction numbers <i>r</i> <sub>0</sub> <sup><i>F</i></sup> (<i>t</i>) and <i>R</i> <sub>0</sub> <sup><i>F</i></sup> (<i>t</i>) are defined for the bird with the avian influenza and for the human with the mutant avian influenza of the free boundary problem, respectively. Properties of these two time-dependent basic reproduction numbers are obtained. Sufficient conditions both for spreading and for vanishing of the avian influenza are given. It is shown that if <i>r</i> <sub>0</sub> <sup><i>F</i></sup> (0) < 1 and the initial number of the infected birds is small, the avian influenza vanishes in the bird world. Furthermore, if <i>r</i> <sub>0</sub> <sup><i>F</i></sup> (0) < 1 and <i>R</i> <sub>0</sub> <sup><i>F</i></sup> (0) < 1, the avian influenza vanishes in the bird and human worlds. In the case that <i>r</i> <sub>0</sub> <sup><i>F</i></sup> (0) < 1 and <i>R</i> <sub>0</sub> <sup><i>F</i></sup> (0) > 1, spreading of the mutant avian influenza in the human world is possible. It is also shown that if <i>r</i> <sub>0</sub> <sup><i>F</i></sup> (<i>t</i> <sub>0</sub>) ⩾ 1 for any <i>t</i> <sub>0</sub> ⩾ 0, the avian influenza spreads in the bird world.","['avianhuman influenza', 'free boundary', 'reactiondiffusion system', 'spreading frontiers']"
Intra and intersession reliability of a postural control protocol in athletes with and without anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: a dual-task paradigm.,"Quantification of dynamic balance is essential to assess a patient's level of injury or ability to function so that a proper plan of care may commence. In spite of comprehensive utilization of dual-tasking in balance assessment protocols, a lack of sufficient reliability data is apparent.The purpose of the present study was to determine the intra- and inter-session reliability of dynamic balance measures obtained using the Biodex Balance System® (BBS) for a group of athletes who had undergone anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) and a matched control group without ACLR, while using a dual-task paradigm.Single-limb postural stability was assessed in 15 athletes who had undergone ACLR and 15 healthy matched controls. The outcome variables included measures of both postural and cognitive performance. For measuring postural performance, the overall stability index (OSI), anterior-posterior stability index (APSI), and medial-lateral stability index (MLSI), were recorded. Cognitive performance was evaluated by measuring error ratio and average reaction time. Subjects faced 4 postural task difficulty levels (platform stabilities of 8 and 6 with eyes open and closed), and 2 cognitive task difficulty levels (with or without auditory Stroop task). During dual task conditions (conditions with Stroop task), error ratio and average reaction time were calculated.Regarding intrasession reliability, ICC values of test session were higher for MLSI [ACL-R group (0.83-0.95), control group (0.71-0.95)] compared to OSI [ACL-R group (0.80-0.92), control group (0.67-0.95)] and APSI [ACL-R group (0.73-0.90), control group (0.62-0.90)]. Furthermore, ICC values of first test session were higher in reaction time [ACL-R group (0.92-0.95), control group (0.80-0.92)] than error ratio [ACL-R group (0.72-0.88), control group (0.61-0.83)]. ICC values of retest session were higher for MLSI [ACL-R group (0.83-0.94), control group (0.87-0.93)] than OSI [ACL-R group (0.81-0.91), control group (0.83-0.93)] and APSI [ACL-R group (0.73-0.90), control group (0.53-0.90)]. Moreover, ICC values of retest session were higher in reaction time [ACL-R group (0.89-0.98), control group (0.80-0.92)] equated with error ratio [ACL-R group (0.73-0.87), control group (0.57-0.79)]. With respect to intersession reliability, ICC values were higher for MLSI [ACL-R group (0.72-0.96), control group (0.75-0.92)] than OSI [ACL-R group (0.55-0.91), control group (0.64-0.87)] and APSI [ACL-R group (0.55-0.79), control group (0.46-0.89)]. Additionally, ICC values were higher in reaction time [ACL-R group (0.87-0.95), control group (0.68-0.81)] in contrast to error ratio [ACL-R group (0.42-0.64), control group (0.54-0.74)].Biodex Balance System® measures of postural stability demonstrated moderate to high reliability in athletes with and without ACLR during dual-tasking. Results of the current study indicated that assessment of postural and cognitive performance in athletes with ACLR may be reliably incorporated into the evaluation of functional activity.2b.","['Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction', 'Biodex Balance System®', 'attention', 'dual‐task paradigm', 'reliability']"
Inhibition of Bacterial Spores and Vegetative Cells by Glycerides.,"Monolaurin, monomyristin, monolinolein, and monolinolenin inhibited cell growth from Bacillus cereus T, Clostridium botulinum 62A, and Clostridium sporogenes PA3679 spores and vegetative cells. The inhibitory action increased in the order monolinolein monomyristin, monolaurin, monolinolenin. Monopalmitin, monostearin, and monolein had a partial effect and diglycerides and triglycerides had no effect. B. cereus T spores were more sensitive to monolaurin, monomyristin, monolinolein, and monolinolenin than vegetative cells. Spores and vegetative cells of C. botulinum 62A were similarly affected by monolaurin, whereas vegetative cells were more resistant to monomyristin, monolinolein, and monolinolenin than spores. In general, C. botulinum 62A and C. sporogenes PA 3679 were more resistant than B. cereus T, except for monolinolein and monomyristin, in which Bacillus spores were more resistant than PA3679 spores. C. botulinum 62A spores were equally (monomyristin) or less resistant (monolaurin, monolinolenin) than PA3679. Monomyristin had the same activity on the three strains. Monolaurin (0.073 to 0.109 mM), monomyristin (0.331 to 0.497 mM), and monolinolenin (0.085 to 0.182 mM) affected germination and outgrowth, whereas monolinolein (0.564 to 0.848 mM) inhibited cell multiplication from B. cereus T spores. Monolaurin (0.145 to 0.182 mM) inhibited outgrowth, but monomyristin (0.331 to 0.497 mM) and monolinolenin (0.142 to 0.182 mM) affected germination of 62A spores. Cell multiplication was inhibited by monolinolein (0.564 to 0.848 mM). C. sporogenes PA3679 spore germination and outgrowth were inhibited by monomyristin (0.331 to 0.497 mM) and monolinolenin (0.142 to 0.282 mM), or monolaurin (0.182 to 0.255 mM), monomyristin (0.165 to 0.248 mM), and monolinolenin (0.085 to 0.113 mM) inhibited cell multiplication from PA3679. Starch neutralized the inhibitory activity of monolaurin, monomyristin, monolinolein, and monolinolenin against 62A spores. The starch antagonism decreased as the concentration of glyceride increased.","['Bacteria', 'glycerides', 'inactivation', 'inhibition', 'spore']"
Comparison of outcomes of conventional WaveLight(®) Allegretto Wave(®) and Technolas(®) excimer lasers in myopic laser in situ keratomileusis.,"To compare the results of laser in situ keratomileusis for myopia using WaveLight(®) Allegretto Wave(®) Eye-Q(®) and Technolas(®) 217z excimer lasers.A retrospective, comparative case series of 442 eyes matched for age and myopia: half each were treated with Allegretto's wavefront-optimized algorithm and Technolas PlanoScan. Outcome measures were postoperative mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE), cylinder, safety and efficacy indices, refractive predictability, and optical zone size selection. Refractive predictability of a subgroup treated for -2.50 to -4.0 diopter (D) was analyzed separately.At mean follow-up of 80.5 days, mean logMAR UCVA, mean MRSE and mean postoperative cylinder were 0.02 ± 0.07 (range -0.12 to 0.30), 0.27 ± 0.36 D (range -1.25 to 1.50 D) and -0.33 ± 0.30 D (range 0.00 to -1.50 D) for Allegretto versus 0.02 ± 0.08 (range -0.12 to 0.40), 0.095 ± 0.47 D (range -1.25 to 1.13 D) and -0.44 ± 0.5 2 D (range 0.00 to -2.25 D) for Technolas (P = 0.98, 0.80 and 0.006). Mean safety and efficacy indices were 1.05 ± 0.13 (0.75-1.33) and 0.97 ± 0.13 (0.50-1.33) for Allegretto and 1.07 ± 0.14 (0.75-1.49) and 0.97 ± 0.17 (0.40-1.49) for Technolas (P = 0.23 and 0.69). Proportions of eyes achieving postoperative MRSE within ±1.0 D, ±0.5 D, and ±0.25 D were 98.2%, 91.9% and 75.6% for Allegretto and 99.1%, 97.8% and 72.4% for Technolas (P = 0.68, 0.20 and 0.51). Mean optical zone size selected was 6.48 ± 0.10 mm (range 6.0-6.5 mm) for Allegretto and 6.38 ± 0.19 mm (range 5.6-6.6 mm) for Technolas (P < 0.001). Of the subgroup with treatment between -2.5 and -4.0 D, 86.8% and 58.5% of eyes treated with Allegretto achieved postoperative MRSE within ±0.50 D and ±0.25 D versus 70.4% and 44.4% for Technolas (P = 0.006 and 0.057).No differences were seen in postoperative mean logMAR UCVA, MRSE, safety and efficacy indices between the two lasers. Allegretto produced less residual astigmatism, possibly improved refractive predictability, and required smaller optical zone selection.","['LASIK', 'conventional laser algorithm', 'laser vision correction', 'myopia']"
Qinggan Huoxue Recipe suppresses epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition in alcoholic liver fibrosis through TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway.,"To investigate the mechanism by which Qinggan Huoxue Recipe (QGHXR) inhibits epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in rats with alcoholic liver fibrosis (ALF).A total of 75 male SD rats were used to induce ALF. Serum biochemical indicators, including alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, laminin and hyaluronidase, were measured. Liver histopathological changes were evaluated using hematoxylin-eosin and Sirius red staining. EMT was examined by analyzing the expression of the epithelial marker E-cadherin and the mesenchymal markers vimentin and fibronectin using RT-PCR and Western blot. The inhibitory effect of QGHXR on EMT markers, as well as its effect on molecules associated with the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1/Smad signaling pathway, including TGF-β1, Smad3, snail, occludin, ZO-1 and claudin, was also examined.Compared with normal control rats, ALF rats exhibited a decrease in E-cadherin levels (mRNA: ALF 0.16 ± 0.05 vs control 1.00 ± 0.08; protein: ALF 0.09 ± 0.05 vs control 0.70 ± 0.17, P < 0.01) and an increase in vimentin and fibronectin levels (mRNA: 11.43 ± 0.39 vs 1.00 ± 0.19 and 9.91 ± 0.34 vs 1.00 ± 0.44, respectively, P < 0.01; protein: 1.13 ± 0.42 vs 0.09 ± 0.03 and 1.16 ± 0.43 vs 0.09 ± 0.00, respectively, P < 0.01). This indicates that EMT occurred in ALF rats. In addition, the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway was activated in ALF rats, as evidenced by the increase in TGF-β1 and snail levels (mRNA: 1.76 ± 0.12 vs 1.00 ± 0.05 and 6.98 ± 0.41 vs 1.00 ± 0.10, respectively, P < 0.01; protein: 1.43 ± 0.05 vs 0.12 ± 0.03 and 1.07 ± 0.29 vs 0.07 ± 0.02, respectively, P < 0.01) and the decrease in Smad3 levels (mRNA: 0.05 ± 0.01 vs 1.00 ± 0.12, P < 0.01; protein: 0.06 ± 0.05 vs 0.89 ± 0.12, P < 0.01). Furthermore, levels of the tight junction markers occludin, ZO-1 and claudin decreased in ALF rats compared with healthy control rats (mRNA: 0.60 ± 0.09 vs 1.00 ± 0.12, 0.11 ± 0.00 vs 1.00 ± 0.12 and 0.60 ± 0.01 vs 1.00 ± 0.08, respectively, P < 0.01; protein: 0.05 ± 0.01 vs 0.87 ± 0.40, 0.09 ± 0.05 vs 0.89 ± 0.18 and 0.04 ± 0.03 vs 0.95 ± 0.21, respectively, P < 0.01). In ALF rats treated with QGHXR, E-cadherin levels increased (mRNA: QGHXR 0.67 ± 0.04 vs ALF model 0.16 ± 0.05, P < 0.01; protein: QGHXR 0.66 ± 0.21 vs ALF model 0.09 ± 0.05, P < 0.01), and vimentin and fibronectin levels decreased (mRNA: 6.57 ± 1.05 vs 11.43 ± 0.39 and 1.45 ± 1.51 vs 9.91 ± 0.34, respectively, P < 0.01; protein: 0.09 ± 0.03 vs 1.13 ± 0.42 and 0.10 ± 0.01 vs 1.16 ± 0.43, respectively, P < 0.01). In addition, QGHXR inhibited the expression of TGF-β1 and increased the expression of Smad3 (mRNA: 1.03 ± 0.11 vs 1.76 ± 0.12, 0.70 ± 0.10 vs 0.05 ± 0.01, respectively, P < 0.05 and P < 0.01; protein: 0.12 ± 0.03 vs 1.43 ± 0.05 and 0.88 ± 0.20 vs 0.06 ± 0.05, respectively, P < 0.01). QGHXR treatment also reduced the levels of the EMT-inducing transcription factor snail (mRNA: 2.28 ± 0.33 vs 6.98 ± 0.41, P < 0.01; protein: 0.08 ± 0.02 vs 1.07 ± 0.29, P < 0.01) and increased the occludin, ZO-1 and claudin levels (mRNA: 0.73 ± 0.05 vs 0.60 ± 0.09, 0.57 ± 0.04 vs 0.11 ± 0.00 and 0.68 ± 0.03 vs 0.60 ± 0.01, respectively, P < 0.01, P < 0.01 and P < 0.05; protein: 0.92 ± 0.50 vs 0.05 ± 0.01, 0.94 ± 0.22 vs 0.09 ± 0.05 and 0.94 ± 0.29 vs 0.04 ± 0.03, respectively, P < 0.01). The effects of QGR and HXR on the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway were similar to that of QGHXR; however, the QGR- and HXR-induced changes in vimentin mRNA levels, the QGR-induced changes in fibronectin mRNA levels and the HXR-induced changes in snail and TGF-β1 mRNA levels were not significant.Qinggan Huoxue Recipe inhibits EMT in ALF rats by modulating the TGF-β1/Smad signaling pathway, suggesting that the mechanism underlying the amelioration of ALF induced by QGHXR is associated with this pathway.","['Alcoholic liver fibrosis', 'Epithelialtomesenchymal transition', 'QGHXR', 'Snail', 'Transforming growth factorβ1Smad']"
A population-based prospective study on rest-activity rhythm and mild cognitive impairment among Hong Kong healthy community-dwelling older adults.,"Relatively few studies investigated the association between rest-activity circadian rhythm and cognitive impairment in population-based study, and the evidence from Asian populations is sparse. We aimed to examine the relationship of actigraphy measured rest-activity circadian rhythm with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or cognitive impairment in Hong Kong healthy community-dwelling older adults.We recruited 174 Hong Kong healthy adults aged ≥65 years (36 male vs. 138 female) during April-September 2018, and followed up them for 12 months. Participants were invited to wear wrist actigraphy for 7 days in both baseline and follow-up study. We used the actigraph data to calculate their midline statistic of rhythm (MESOR), amplitude, acrophase and percent rhythm. Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) was used to assess their cognitive scores at baseline and follow-up. Multivariate logistic regression model was performed to estimate the association of rest-activity circadian rhythm parameters with MCI; whilst multinomial logistic regression model was used to examine the association between rhythm parameters and changes of cognitive scores (i.e., worsen: <-1, stable: -1 to 1, better cognition: ≥2) after 12-months follow-up respectively.There was no association between rest-activity circadian rhythm parameters and MCI or cognitive impairment at baseline. Compared to those with an averaged value of acrophase (1:24pm-3:00pm), results of multinominal logistic regression showed that participants with a delayed acrophase (after 3:00pm) were less likely to have better cognition (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.11-0.88). Upon one year of follow-up, participants who delayed their acrophase for 24 min than their baseline measurements were also less likely to have better cognitive functions (AOR = 0.26, 95%CI = 0.08-0.79).Results from both the baseline survey and follow-up study consistently confirmed that older adults, especially in light of the majority of participants being the females, with delayed acrophase were less likely to have better cognition in the Asian population.","['Actigraphy', 'Circadian rhythm', 'Cognition', 'Cohort studies', 'Elderly']"
Psychometric properties of the Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS) in a knee osteoarthritis population.,"Symptoms resembling neuropathic pain (neuropathic-like symptoms) are prevalent in osteoarthritis (OA) populations. Scales that measure neuropathic-like symptoms frequently were established in groups with true neuropathic pain conditions and have not been assessed in OA. We assessed the psychometric properties of the Neuropathic Pain Scale (NPS) in subjects with OA undergoing total knee replacement (TKR).In a prospective study of adults undergoing TKR for OA, we assessed baseline distributions, acceptability (completion rate), internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), responsiveness 12 months post-TKR, and construct validity of the NPS. We performed factor analysis and created subscales from the items loading onto each retained factor. We evaluated subscale properties and calculated the proportion of total scores attributable to each subscale and compared this with the proportion expected if each item contributed equally.Mean baseline NPS score among 263 participants was 42.7 (SD: 15.9). Cronbach's alpha was 0.88. Factor analysis produced two factors: ""bothersome"" (items: intense/sharp/dull/unpleasant/deep; Cronbach's alpha = 0.87), and ""dysesthetic"" (items: cold/sensitive/itchy/surface; alpha = 0.77). Bothersome items contributed more to total NPS scores (74%) than would be expected if each item contributed equally (50%). NPS scores correlated moderately with baseline pain and function, and decreased after TKR, with standardized response means (SRMs) of: total NPS: 1.77, Bothersome subscale: 2.03, Dysesthetic subscale: 0.70.The NPS had acceptable completion, internal consistency, and construct validity, but was not optimal for use in OA; Bothersome subscale items disproportionately drive total NPS scores and may fail to discriminate between nociceptive and neuropathic-like symptoms.","['Neuropathic pain', 'Osteoarthritis', 'Psychometric properties', 'Total knee replacement', 'Validation']"
The Relationship of Heterodera schachtii Population Densities to Sugarbeet Yields.,"Sugarbeet yields were contpared with field populations of Heterodera schachtii Schmidt. The correlation between sugarbeet yields and viable larvae/g of soil was negative and high, but that between sugarbeet yields and viable cysts/g of soil was lower. Sugarbeet yields were also compared with H. schachtii populations by years of rotation with a nonhost crop. The coefficients of correlation (r) between yield and viable larvae/g of soil were negative and high: 0 yr of rotation, -0.935; 1 yr, -0.922; 2 yr, -0.954; 3 yr, -0.935; and combined years, -0.965, with 95% confidence limits of -0.91 to -0.98 for combined years. The comparable correlation coefficients between yield and ""viable cysts""/g of soil were negative and lower: 0 yr of rotation, -0.151; 1 yr, -0.022; 2 yr, -0.490; 3 yr, -0.456; and combined years, -0.586, with 95% confidence limits of -0.22 to -0.80 for the combined years.","['Beta vulgaris', 'crop rotation', 'cystsg soil', 'larvae gsoil', 'sugarbeet cyst nematode', 'sugarbeet yields']"
What Is the Role of Barbed Suture in Laparoscopic Myomectomy? A Meta-Analysis and Pregnancy Outcome Evaluation.,"This work analyzes the feasibility and effectiveness of barbed suture during laparoscopic myomectomy.Eight works have been carefully examined for the meta-analysis from all papers published online until November 2017.Barbed suture proved to be superior to traditional suture technique in blood loss in laparoscopic myomectomy (Standardized Mean Difference [SMD] -0.650, 95% CI -1.420 to -0.119, p = 0.098, test for heterogenity p < 0.0001, I2 = 95.54%), Hb drop (SMD -1.452, 95% CI -3.590 to 0.687, p = 0.183, test for heterogenity p < 0.0001, I2 = 99.08%), suturing difficulty (SMD -0.638, 95% CI -0.935 to -0.342, p ≤ 0.001, test for heterogenity p = 0.25, I2 = 27.84%), suturing time (SMD -1.197, 95% CI -1.848 to -0.549, p ≤0.001, test for heterogenity p = 0.0001, I2 = 83.30%) and total operative time (SMD -0.687, 95% CI -0.804 to -0.569, p ≤ 0.001, test for heterogenity p = 0.292, I2 = 17.44%). Barbed suture demonstrated to be better in comparison with the control group even with regard to the length of hospitalization (SMD -0.278, 95% CI -0.543 to 0.012, p = 0.040, test for heterogenity p = 0.025, I2 = 61.85%), and to perioperative complications (SMD 0.708, 95% CI 0.503-0.996, p = 0.048, test for heterogenity p = 0.79, I2 = 0%).Barbed suture significantly facilitates laparoscopic myomectomy by reducing the total operative/suturing time, estimated blood loss/Hb drop, and reduction of perioperative complications.","['Pregnancy', 'Barbed suture', 'Laparoscopy', 'Metaanalysis', 'Myomectomy']"
Effects of medium chain fatty acids as a mitigation or prevention strategy against porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in swine feed.,"Feed has been shown to be a vector for viral transmission. Four experiments were conducted to: 1) determine if medium chain fatty acids (MCFA) are effective mitigants when applied to feed both pre- and post-porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) inoculation measured by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), 2) evaluate varying levels and combinations of MCFA measured by qRT-PCR, and 3) evaluate selected treatments in bioassay to determine infectivity. In exp. 1, treatments were arranged in a 2 × 2 + 1 factorial with main effects of treatment (0.3% commercial formaldehyde [CF] product, Sal CURB [Kemin Industries, Inc.; Des Moines, IA], or 1% MCFA blend (Blend) of 1:1:1 C6:C8:C10 [PMI, Arden Hills, MN]) and timing of application (pre- or post-inoculation with PEDV) plus a positive control (PC; feed inoculated with PEDV and no treatment). All combinations of treatment and timing decreased detectable PEDV compared with the PC (P < 0.05). Pre-inoculation treatment elicited decreased magnitude of PEDV detection (cycle threshold value) compared with post-inoculation (P = 0.009). Magnitude of PEDV detection was decreased for CF compared with Blend (P < 0.0001). In exp. 2, pre-inoculation treatments consisted of: 1) PC, 2) 0.3% CF, 3 to 5) 0.125% to 0.33% C6:0, 6 to 8) 0.125% to 0.33% C8:0, 9 to 11) 0.125% to 0.33% C10:0, and 12 to 15) 0.125% to 0.66% C5:0. Treating feed with 0.33% C8:0 resulted in decreased (P < 0.05) PEDV detection compared with all other treatments. Increasing concentration of each individual MCFA decreased PEDV detectability (P < 0.042). In exp. 3, pre-inoculation treatments consisted of: 1) PC, 2) 0.3% CF, 3 to 7) 0.25% to 1% Blend, 8 to 10) 0.125% to 0.33% C6:0 + C8:0, 11 to 13) 0.125% to 0.33% C6:0 + C10:0, and 14 to 16) 0.125% to 0.33% C8:0 + C10:0. Treating feed with CF, 0.5% Blend, 0.75% Blend, 1% Blend, all levels of C6:0+C8:0, 0.25% C6:0 + 0.25% C10:0, 0.33% C6:0 + 0.33% C10:0, 0.25% C8:0 + 0.25% C10:0, or 0.33% C8:0 + 0.33% C10:0 elicited decreased detection of PEDV compared with PC (P < 0.05). Increasing concentration of each MCFA combination decreased PEDV detectability (linear, P < 0.012). In exp. 4, feed was treated pre-inoculation with: 1) no treatment (PC), 2) 0.3% CF, 3) 0.5% Blend, or 4) 0.3% C8:0 and analyzed via qRT-PCR and bioassay. Adding 0.5% Blend or 0.3% C8:0 resulted in decreased PEDV compared with PC and only PC resulted in a positive bioassay. Therefore, MCFA can decrease detection of PEDV in feed. Further, inclusion of lower levels of MCFA than previously evaluated are effective against PEDV.","['medium chain fatty acid', 'porcine epidemic diarrhea virus', 'swine']"
Diagnostic Ability of Volatile Organic Compounds in Digestive Cancer: A Systematic Review With Meta-Analysis.,"Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) have been involved in cancer diagnosis via breath, urine, and feces. We aimed to assess the diagnostic ability of VOCs on digestive cancers.We systematically reviewed prospective clinical trials evaluating VOCs' diagnostic ability on esophageal, gastric, colorectal, hepatic, and pancreatic cancer (PC). Databases including PubMed and Ovid-Medline were searched.A total of 35 trials with 5314 patient-times qualified for inclusion. The pooled sensitivity of VOCs diagnosing gastroesophageal cancer from healthy controls is 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.82-0.94), the pooled specificity is 0.890 (95% CI: 0.84-0.93), and area under the curve (AUC) of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve is 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93-0.95). The pooled sensitivity of VOCs diagnosing colorectal cancer from heathy controls is 0.92 (95% CI: 0.85-0.96), the pooled specificity is 0.88 (95% CI: 0.77-0.94), and the AUC is 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94-0.97). The pooled sensitivity of VOCs distinguishing gastrointestinal (GI) cancer from precancerous lesions is 0.84 (95% CI: 0.67-0.92), the pooled specificity is 0.74 (95% CI: 0.43-0.91), and the AUC is 0.87 (95% CI: 0.84-0.89). The pooled sensitivity of VOCs diagnosing hepatocellular carcinoma is 0.68 (95% CI: 0.52-0.81), the pooled specificity is 0.81 (95% CI: 0.47-0.96), and the AUC is 0.78 (95% CI: 0.74-0.81). The pooled sensitivity of VOCs diagnosing PC is 0.88 (95% CI: 0.80-0.93), the pooled specificity is 0.82 (95% CI: 0.62-0.93), and the AUC is 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89-0.94).Volatile organic compounds have potential role in diagnosing GI cancer with comparatively high sensitivity, specificity, and AUC (PROSPERO registration number: CRD42021260039).","['Volatile organic compounds', 'diagnosis', 'digestive cancer', 'gas biopsy', 'metaanalysis']"
Links between perinatal risk factors and maternal psychological distress: A network analysis.,"This paper explores a range of perinatal risk factors that may increase maternal vulnerability to postnatal psychological distress in a sample of 17 531 women participating in the Millennium Cohort Study, a diverse British, longitudinal birth cohort study.Using a graphical network modeling framework, this study models the links between postnatal psychological distress and perinatal risk factors, while controlling for sociodemographic factors and history of depression and anxiety. Postnatal psychological distress was assessed at 9 months postpartum using the Rutter Malaise Inventory.Results of the graphical network models indicate that lower levels of happiness about the pregnancy (Edge weight [w] = 0.084, 95% CI = 0.069-0.100, b = 0.095), smoking during pregnancy (w = 0.026, 95% CI = -0.009-0.060, b = 0.029), infection during pregnancy (w = 0.071, 95% CI = 0.024-0.118, b = 0.090), hyperemesis gravidarum (w = 0.068, 95% CI = 0.013-0.123, b = 0.083), baby in special care (w = 0.048, 95% CI = -0.004-0.099, b = 0.062), not being white (w = 0.101, 95% CI = 0.062-0.140, b = 0.118), being from a more deprived area (w = -0.028, 95% CI = -0.051 to -0.005, b = -0.039), lower income (w = -0.025, 95% CI = -0.055-0.005, b = -0.036), and history of depression or anxiety (w = 0.574, 95% CI = 0.545-0.603, b = 0.764) were associated with increased psychological distress.Some perinatal risk factors may be directly associated with postnatal psychological distress, but many risk factors appear to be primarily associated with demographic factors. This emphasizes the importance of taking a holistic approach when evaluating an individual's risk of developing postnatal psychological distress.","['graphical model', 'millennium cohort study', 'perinatal risk factors', 'postnatal psychological distress', 'pregnancy']"
Detecting glaucoma from multi-modal data using probabilistic deep learning.,"To assess the accuracy of probabilistic deep learning models to discriminate normal eyes and eyes with glaucoma from fundus photographs and visual fields.Algorithm development for discriminating normal and glaucoma eyes using data from multicenter, cross-sectional, case-control study.Fundus photograph and visual field data from 1,655 eyes of 929 normal and glaucoma subjects to develop and test deep learning models and an independent group of 196 eyes of 98 normal and glaucoma patients to validate deep learning models.Accuracy and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC).Fundus photographs and OCT images were carefully examined by clinicians to identify glaucomatous optic neuropathy (GON). When GON was detected by the reader, the finding was further evaluated by another clinician. Three probabilistic deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models were developed using 1,655 fundus photographs, 1,655 visual fields, and 1,655 pairs of fundus photographs and visual fields collected from Compass instruments. Deep learning models were trained and tested using 80% of fundus photographs and visual fields for training set and 20% of the data for testing set. Models were further validated using an independent validation dataset. The performance of the probabilistic deep learning model was compared with that of the corresponding deterministic CNN model.The AUC of the deep learning model in detecting glaucoma from fundus photographs, visual fields, and combined modalities using development dataset were 0.90 (95% confidence interval: 0.89-0.92), 0.89 (0.88-0.91), and 0.94 (0.92-0.96), respectively. The AUC of the deep learning model in detecting glaucoma from fundus photographs, visual fields, and both modalities using the independent validation dataset were 0.94 (0.92-0.95), 0.98 (0.98-0.99), and 0.98 (0.98-0.99), respectively. The AUC of the deep learning model in detecting glaucoma from fundus photographs, visual fields, and both modalities using an early glaucoma subset were 0.90 (0.88,0.91), 0.74 (0.73,0.75), 0.91 (0.89,0.93), respectively. Eyes that were misclassified had significantly higher uncertainty in likelihood of diagnosis compared to eyes that were classified correctly. The uncertainty level of the correctly classified eyes is much lower in the combined model compared to the model based on visual fields only. The AUCs of the deterministic CNN model using fundus images, visual field, and combined modalities based on the development dataset were 0.87 (0.85,0.90), 0.88 (0.84,0.91), and 0.91 (0.89,0.94), and the AUCs based on the independent validation dataset were 0.91 (0.89,0.93), 0.97 (0.95,0.99), and 0.97 (0.96,0.99), respectively, while the AUCs based on an early glaucoma subset were 0.88 (0.86,0.91), 0.75 (0.73,0.77), and 0.92 (0.89,0.95), respectively.Probabilistic deep learning models can detect glaucoma from multi-modal data with high accuracy. Our findings suggest that models based on combined visual field and fundus photograph modalities detects glaucoma with higher accuracy. While probabilistic and deterministic CNN models provided similar performance, probabilistic models generate certainty level of the outcome thus providing another level of confidence in decision making.","['artificial intelligence', 'automated diagnosis', 'deep learning', 'fundus photograph', 'glaucoma', 'visual field']"
Relationships of Antidepressant Medication With Its Various Factors Including Nitrogen Dioxides Seasonality: Machine Learning Analysis Using National Health Insurance Data.,"This study employs machine learning and population-based data to examine major factors of antidepressant medication including nitrogen dioxides (NO2) seasonality.Retrospective cohort data came from Korea National Health Insurance Service claims data for 43,251 participants with the age of 15-79 years, residence in the same districts of Seoul and no history of antidepressant medication during 2002-2012. The dependent variable was antidepressant-free months during 2013-2015 and the 103 independent variables for 2012 or 2015 were considered, e.g., particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometer in diameter (PM2.5), PM10, NO2, ozone (O3), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and carbon monoxide (CO) in each of 12 months in 2015.It was found that the Cox hazard ratios of NO2 were statistically significant and registered values larger than 10 for every three months: March, June-July, October, and December. Based on random forest variable importance and Cox hazard ratios in brackets, indeed, the top 20 factors of antidepressant medication included age (0.0041 [1.69-2.25]), migraine and sleep disorder (0.0029 [1.82]), liver disease (0.0017 [1.33-1.34]), exercise (0.0014), thyroid disease (0.0013), cardiovascular disease (0.0013 [1.20]), asthma (0.0008 [1.19-1.20]), September NO2 (0.0008 [0.01]), alcohol consumption (0.0008 [1.31-1.32]), gender - woman (0.0007 [1.80-1.81]), July NO2 (0.0007 [14.93]), July PM10 (0.0007), the proportion of the married (0.0005), January PM2.5 (0.0004), September PM2.5 (0.0004), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.0004), economic satisfaction (0.0004), January PM10 (0.0003), residents in welfare facilities per 1,000 (0.0003 [0.97]), and October NO2 (0.0003).Antidepressant medication has strong associations with neighborhood conditions including NO2 seasonality and welfare support.","['Antidepressive agents', 'Machine learning', 'Nitrogen', 'Particulate matter']"
The Impact of Psychopathology Associated With Childhood Trauma on Quality of Life in Portuguese Adolescents: A Two-Wave Longitudinal Study.,"<b>Introduction:</b> The aim of this study was to explore the mediating effect of psychopathology between childhood adversity and trauma and quality of life (QOL) in adolescents. The second aim of the study was testing the moderation by social support of this mediation effect. <b>Methods:</b> Self-reports of childhood adversity and trauma, QOL, social support, and psychopathology were collected from 150 Portuguese adolescents' who had been exposed to at least one traumatic event or one childhood adversity (<i>M</i> <sub>age</sub> = 16.89, <i>SD</i> = 1.32). The surveys were administered at two time points with an approximate time interval of 1 year. <b>Results:</b> Indirect effects were observed for depression (<i>B</i> = -0.33, CI [-0.62, -0.11]), somatization (<i>B</i> = -0.52, CI [-0.82, -0.23]), and post-traumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) (<i>B</i> = -0.23, CI [-0.45, -0.01]), but not for anxiety (<i>B</i> = 0.20, CI [-0.08, 0.50]). A moderated mediation was found between social support and depression (<i>B</i> = -0.10, CI [-16, -0.04]), and PTSS (<i>B</i> = 0.03, CI [-0.1, -0.05]), but not for somatization (<i>B</i> = -0.02, CI [-0.8, 0.05]). <b>Conclusions:</b> We found that depression and somatization were strong mediators of the relationship between adversity/trauma and QOL, whereas PTSS was moderately mediated this relationship. Anxiety did not mediate this relationship. The moderated-mediation effect of social support was only found for depression and PTSS. The improvement of QOL in adolescents exposed to childhood adversity and trauma should include the assessment of psychopathology symptoms and social support, with the aim of identifying risk and protective factors.","['adolescents', 'adversity', 'psychopathology', 'quality of life', 'social support', 'trauma']"
Relation of Intracerebral Hemorrhage Descriptors with Clinical Factors.,"The association between intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) shape and a poor treatment outcome has been established by few authors. We decided to analyze whether computationally assessed hemorrhage shape irregularity is associated with any known predictors of its poor treatment outcome. We retrospectively analyzed 48 patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage. For each patient we calculated Fractal Dimension, Compactness, Fourier Factor and Circle Factor. Our study showed that patients above 65 years old had significantly higher Compactness (0.70 ± 0.19 vs. 0.56 ± 0.20; <i>p</i> < 0.01), Fractal Dimension (0.46 ± 0.22 vs. 0.32 ± 0.20; <i>p</i> = 0.03) and Circle Factor (0.51 ± 0.25 vs. 0.35 ± 0.17; <i>p</i> < 0.01). Patients with hemorrhage growth had significantly higher Compactness (0.74 ± 0.23 vs. 0.58 ± 0.18; <i>p</i> < 0.01), Circle Factor (0.55 ± 0.27 vs. 0.37 ± 0.18; <i>p</i> < 0.01) and Fourier Factor (0.96 ± 0.06 vs. 0.84 ± 0.19; <i>p</i> = 0.03). In conclusion, irregularity resulting from the number of appendices can be a predictor of ICH growth; however, the size of those appendices is also important. Shape roughness better reflects the severity of brain tissue damage and a patient's general condition.","['intracerebral hemorrhage', 'shape analysis', 'treatment outcome']"
Association between Age at Menarche and Cardiovascular Disease Risk Factors in China: A Large Population-Based Investigation.,"The association between age at menarche (AAM) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) has previously been investigated with controversial results. The relationship between the psychological characteristic of AAM and many cardiovascular risk factors remains unclear.To assess the association between AAM and CVD risk factors in a large population.13,242 women aged 24-79 years were recruited from China mainland during 2009-2013 for a cross-sectional, population-based study to investigate the association between AAM and CVD risk factors. Information on AAM was obtained from self-report and information on CVD risk factors from physical examination.In age-, body-mass-index- and height-adjusted analyses, AAM was positively associated with hypertension and 'college or above' educational level and incident CVD events. The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% conﬁdence intervals for hypertension across AAM categories (≤12, 13-14, 15-16, and ≥17 years) were 0.820 (0.70-0.96), 0.82 (0.70-0.96), 0.88 (0.79-0.99) and 1 (referent), respectively; adjusted ORs for high educational level ('college or above') were 0.29 (0.24-0.34), 0.60 (0.41-0.51), 0.69 (0.62-0.76), and 1 (referent), respectively; adjusted ORs for incident CVD events were 0.18 (0.08-0.41), 0.18 (0.08-0.41), 0.62 (0.41-0.93), 1 (referent), respectively.Earlier AAM were positively associated with incident CVD events, hypertension and 'college or above' educational level.","['Age at menarche', 'Cardiovascular disease', 'Large population', 'Risk factors']"
Mindfulness and negative emotions among Chinese college students: chain mediation effect of rumination and resilience.,"This study examines the mediation effect of rumination and resilience between the relationship of mindfulness and negative emotions in Chinese college students.A total of 3,038 college students (19.94 ± 1.10) were investigated by Mindfulness Attention Awareness Scale (MASS), Rumination Response Style Scale (RRS), Resilience Scale (RES) and Depression-anxiety-pressure scale (DASS-21), and the mediation analyses were conducted by adopting PROCESS macro in the SPSS software.① Mindfulness was negatively associated with rumination and negative emotions (<i>r</i> = -0.69, -0.72; <i>P</i> < 0.01), and positively associated with resilience (<i>r</i> = 0.63, <i>P</i> < 0.01). Rumination was negatively associated with resilience (<i>r</i> = -0.59, <i>P</i> < 0.01), and positively associated with negative emotions (<i>r</i> = 0.83, <i>P</i> < 0.01). Resilience was negatively associated with negative emotions (<i>r</i> = -0.71, <i>P</i> < 0.01). ② Mindfulness can not only directly predict negative emotions (95%CI, -0.12~-0.09) but also affects negative emotions through three indirect paths: Rumination was a mediator (95%CI, -0.24~-0.20), resilience was a mediator (95%CI, -0.07~-0.06), and resilience and rumination were a chain mediator (95%CI, -0.04 ~ -0.03).Mindfulness not only influences negative emotions directly, bu<i>t</i> also through the mediating effect of rumination and resilience indirectly.","['college students', 'mindfulness', 'negative emotions', 'resilience', 'rumination']"
Ocular Biometry and Their Correlations with Ocular and Anthropometric Measurements Among Ethiopian Adults.,"To determine the average values of ocular biometry dimensions and investigate their inter-correlations and their association with anthropometric measurements among Ethiopian adults with healthy eyes.A cross-sectional study was undertaken from June 2018 to July 2019. A total of 400 eyes of 200 subjects were included in the study. Univariable and multivariable linear regression were used to determine the association of demographic variables (age and sex) and anthropometric parameters (height, weight and BMI) with ocular biometric indices.The mean age was 40.31±11.39 with a range from 18 to 69 years. The mean (SD) of horizontal corneal diameter, average corneal refractive power, anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness (LT) and axial length (AL) were 11.45 (0.89) mm, 43.94 (9.78) diopter, 2.91 (0.43) mm, 4.29 (0.55) mm and 22.96 (0.82) mm, respectively. Age had a negative correlation with ACD (r= -0.196, <i>p</i>= <0.001) and positive correlation with lens thickness (r= 0.324, <i>p</i><0.001). Height had a positive correlation with ACD (r=0.114, <i>p</i>=0.023) and LT (r= 0.206, p=<0.001) while negative correlation with LT (r=-0.129, <i>p</i>=0.01). In the multivariate linear regression, age (-0.009 (-0.013, -0.05), <i>p</i>-value <0.001) and sex (0.104 (0.01, 0.198), <i>p</i>-value=0.03) had a significant association with ACD and only gender (0.478 (0.302, 0.654), <i>p</i>-value <0.001) had a statistically significant association with lens thickness.This study determined the normative values for ocular biometric parameters among Ethiopian adults for the first time. Age, gender and height were associated with biometric indices. AL was significantly positively correlated with ACD and negatively correlated with LT. There was a negative correlation between LT and both AL and ACD.","['anterior chamber depth', 'anthropometry', 'biometry', 'glaucoma']"
Effect of the Shensong Yangxin Capsule on Energy Metabolism in Angiotensin II-Induced Cardiac Hypertrophy.,"Shensong Yangxin Capsule (SSYX), traditional Chinese medicine, has been used to treat arrhythmias, angina, cardiac remodeling, cardiac fibrosis, and so on, but its effect on cardiac energy metabolism is still not clear. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of SSYX on myocardium energy metabolism in angiotensin (Ang) II-induced cardiac hypertrophy.We used 2 μl (10<sup>-6</sup> mol/L) AngII to treat neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs) for 48 h. Myocardial α-actinin staining showed that the myocardial cell volume increased. Expression of the cardiac hypertrophic marker-brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) messenger RNA (mRNA) also increased by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Therefore, it can be assumed that the model of hypertrophic cardiomyocytes was successfully constructed. Then, NRCMs were treated with 1 μl of different concentrations of SSYX (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 μg/ml) for another 24 h. To explore the time-depend effect of SSYX on energy metabolism, 0.5 μg/ml SSYX was added into cells for 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h. Mitochondria was assessed by MitoTracker staining and confocal microscopy. mRNA and protein expression of mitochondrial biogenesis-related genes - Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), energy balance key factor - adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), fatty acids oxidation factor - carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), and glucose oxidation factor - glucose transporter- 4 (GLUT-4) were measured by PCR and Western blotting analysis.With the increase in the concentration of SSYX (from 0.25 to 1.0 μg/ml), an increased mitochondrial density in AngII-induced cardiomyocytes was found compared to that of those treated with AngII only (0.25 μg/ml, 18.3300 ± 0.8895 vs. 24.4900 ± 0.9041, t = 10.240, P < 0.0001; 0.5 μg/ml, 18.3300 ± 0.8895 vs. 25.9800 ± 0.8187, t = 12.710, P < 0.0001; and 1.0 μg/ml, 18.3300 ± 0.8895 vs. 24.2900 ± 1.3120, t = 9.902, P < 0.0001; n = 5 per dosage group). SSYX also increased the mRNA and protein expression of PGC-1α (0.25 μg/ml, 0.8892 ± 0.0848 vs. 1.0970 ± 0.0994, t = 4.319, P = 0.0013; 0.5 μg/ml, 0.8892 ± 0.0848 vs. 1.2330 ± 0.0564, t = 7.150, P < 0.0001; and 1.0 μg/ml, 0.8892 ± 0.0848 vs. 1.1640 ± 0.0755, t = 5.720, P < 0.0001; n = 5 per dosage group), AMPK (0.25 μg/ml, 0.8872 ± 0.0779 vs. 1.1500 ± 0.0507, t = 7.239, P < 0.0001; 0.5 μg/ml, 0.8872 ± 0.0779 vs. 1.2280 ± 0.0623, t = 9.379, P < 0.0001; and 1.0 μg/ml, 0.8872 ± 0.0779 vs. 1.3020 ± 0.0450, t = 11.400, P < 0.0001; n = 5 per dosage group), CPT-1 (1.0 μg/ml, 0.7348 ± 0.0594 vs. 0.9880 ± 0.0851, t = 4.994, P = 0.0007, n = 5), and GLUT-4 (0.5 μg/ml, 1.5640 ± 0.0599 vs. 1.7720 ± 0.0660, t = 3.783, P = 0.0117; 1.0 μg/ml, 1.5640 ± 0.0599 vs. 2.0490 ± 0.1280, t = 8.808, P < 0.0001; n = 5 per dosage group). The effect became more obvious with the increasing concentration of SSYX. When 0.5 μg/ml SSYX was added into cells for 0, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h, the expression of AMPK (6 h, 14.6100 ± 0.6205 vs. 16.5200 ± 0.7450, t = 3.456, P = 0.0250; 12 h, 14.6100 ± 0.6205 vs. 18.3200 ± 0.9965, t = 6.720, P < 0.0001; 24 h, 14.6100 ± 0.6205 vs. 21.8800 ± 0.8208, t = 13.160, P < 0.0001; and 48 h, 14.6100 ± 0.6205 vs. 23.7400 ± 1.0970, t = 16.530, P < 0.0001; n = 5 per dosage group), PGC-1α (12 h, 11.4700 ± 0.7252 vs. 16.9000 ± 1.0150, t = 7.910, P < 0.0001; 24 h, 11.4700 ± 0.7252 vs. 20.8800 ± 1.2340, t = 13.710, P < 0.0001; and 48 h, 11.4700 ± 0.7252 vs. 22.0300 ± 1.4180, t = 15.390; n = 5 per dosage group), CPT-1 (24 h, 15.1600 ± 1.0960 vs. 18.5800 ± 0.9049, t = 6.048, P < 0.0001, n = 5), and GLUT-4 (6 h, 10.2100 ± 0.9485 vs. 12.9700 ± 0.8221, t = 4.763, P = 0.0012; 12 h, 10.2100 ± 0.9485 vs. 16.9100 ± 0.8481, t = 11.590, P < 0.0001; 24 h, 10.2100 ± 0.9485 vs. 19.0900 ± 0.9797, t = 15.360, P < 0.0001; and 48 h, 10.2100 ± 0.9485 vs. 14.1900 ± 0.9611, t = 6.877, P < 0.0001; n = 5 per dosage group) mRNA and protein increased gradually with the prolongation of drug action time.SSYX could increase myocardial energy metabolism in AngII-induced cardiac hypertrophy. Therefore, SSYX might be considered to be an alternative therapeutic remedy for myocardial hypertrophy.","['AMPActivated Protein Kinase', 'Cardiac Hypertrophy', 'Energy Metabolism', 'Peroxisome ProliferatorActivated Receptor Gamma Coactivator1 Alpha', 'Shensong Yangxin Capsule']"
Restrictive pulmonary deficit is associated with inflammation in sub-optimally controlled obese diabetics.,"Caribbean data linking inflammation, pulmonary dysfunction and diabetes is unavailable. Spirometry, acanthosis nigricans, hs-CRP were assessed in 109 type 2 diabetics (43% males) mean age=55.6 years, BMI=29.29 kg/m(2), waist circumference=103.86 cm. Residual FEV1/FVC increased with age (P=0.005), BMI (P=0.011) and waist circumference (P=0.003). Residual FVC related inversely to hs-CRP (-0.178), P<0.06) systolic (-0.028, P<0.031), diastolic (-0.247, P<0.010) pressure and weight (-0.25, P<0.009). Residual FEV1 related inversely to diastolic pressure (-0.219, P<0.023), hs-CRP (-0.234, P<0.015), acanthosis nigricans (-0.029, P<0.029). HbA1C and residual FEV1 predict high hs-CRP (P=0.011, P=0.046).

Association Between Changes in Post-hospital Cardiac Symptoms and Changes in Acute Coronary Syndrome-Induced Symptoms of Post-traumatic Stress.,"After acute coronary syndrome (ACS), one in eight patients develops clinically significant symptoms of Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We hypothesized that changes in cardiac symptoms from 3 to 12 months after ACS are associated with changes in ACS-induced PTSD symptoms.At 3 (<i>n</i> = 154) and/or 12 months (<i>n</i> = 106) post-ACS, patients (<i>n</i> = 156, mean age 59 years, 85% men) completed a clinical interview assessing chest tightness/pain (at rest and/or during exertion), heartbeat symptoms (heart palpitations, racing of heart, heart stumbling or skipping a beat) and PTSD symptoms during the prior 4 weeks. Random mixed regression models examined the association between the onset (or remission) from 3 to 12 months in cardiac symptoms with changes in PTSD symptoms, adjusting for a range of potential predictors of ACS-induced PTSD symptoms.The onset of chest tightness/pain [estimate = 0.588, 95% confidence interval: 0.275, 0.090; <i>p</i> < 0.001] and of heartbeat symptoms [0.548 (0.165, 0.931); <i>p</i> = 0.005] from 3 to 12 months was independently associated with an increase in total PTSD symptoms. There were also independent associations between the onset of chest tightness/pain and heartbeat symptoms with an increase in PTSD symptom clusters. Specifically, the onset of chest tightness/pain showed associations with an increase in re-experiencing [0.450 (0.167, 0.733); <i>p</i> = 0.027] and avoidance/numbing [0.287 (0.001, 0.574); <i>p</i> = 0.049]. The onset of heartbeat symptoms showed associations with an increase in re-experiencing [0.392 (0.045, 0.739); <i>p</i> = 0.002], avoidance/numbing [0.513 (0.161, 0.864); <i>p</i> = 0.004] and hyperarousal [0.355 (0.051, 0.659); <i>p</i> = 0.022]. An increase in the total number of cardiac symptoms (score range 0-6) was also associated with an increase in total PTSD symptoms [0.343 (0.202, 0.484); <i>p</i> < 0.001]. Psychotherapy in the post-hospital period moderated the association between the change in heartbeat symptoms and the change in total PTSD symptoms [-0.813 (-1.553, -0.074); <i>p</i> = 0.031 for interaction]; the association between the onset of heart beat symptoms and an increase in total PTSD symptoms was weaker in patients who attended psychotherapy [0.437 (-0.178, 1.052); <i>p</i> = 0.16] than in those who did not [0.825 (0.341, 1.309); <i>p</i> < 0.001].Changes in cardiac symptoms between 3 and 12 months after hospitalization are associated with changes in ACS-induced PTSD symptoms.

Predictors of high dose of massed practice following stroke.,"The aim of this study is to determine the factors that affect patients' ability to carry out high dose of massed practice.Patients with stroke were included in the study if they had no severe impairment in motor and cognitive functions. Dose of massed practice, motor function, perceived amount and quality of use of the arm in the real world, wrist and elbow flexors spasticity, dominant hand stroke, presence of shoulder pain, and central post-stroke pain were assessed on the first day. Dose of massed practice was assessed again on the second day. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and linear multiple regression.Only motor function (<i>β</i> <b>=</b> -0.310, <i>r</i> = 0.787, <i>P</i> < 0.001), perceived amount of use (<i>β</i> <b>=</b> 0.300, <i>r</i> = 0.823; 95% CI = 0.34-107.224, <i>P</i> = 0.049), severity of shoulder pain (<i>β</i> <b>=</b> -0.155, <i>r</i> = -0.472, <i>P</i> = 0.019), wrist flexors spasticity (<i>β</i> <b>=</b> -0.154, <i>r</i> = -0.421, <i>P</i> = 0.002), age (<i>β</i> <b>=</b> -0.129, <i>r</i> = -0.366, <i>P</i> = 0.018), dominant hand stroke (<i>β</i> <b>=</b> -0.091, <i>r</i> = -0.075, <i>P</i> = 0.041), and sex (<i>β</i> <b>=</b> -0.090, <i>r</i> = -0.161, <i>P</i> = 0.036) significantly influenced patients' ability to carry out high dose of massed practice.Many factors affect patients' ability to carry out high dose of massed practice. Understanding these factors can help in designing appropriate rehabilitation.","['activities of daily living', 'dose', 'motor recovery', 'quality of life']"
The Association between Serum Testosterone and Risk Factors for Atherosclerosis.,"To study the associations between serum testosterone and risk factors for atherosclerosis in 119 men from general population.Systolic pressure, body mass index (BMI), testosterone, fasting glucose, glucose tolerance test, apolipoprotein A-1 (ApoA-1), apolipoprotein B (ApoB), and ApoB/ApoA-1 ratio were assessed. Subjects classified into hypogonadal (testosterone ≤ 12 nmol/l), and eugonadal men (testosterone > 12 nmol/l).BMI (28 vs. 26 kg/ m<sup>2</sup>, p = 0.01), systolic pressure (129 vs. 123 mmHg, p = 0.03), fasting glucose (5.9 vs. 5.5 mmol/l, p = 0.03), ApoB (1.1 vs. 1.0 g/l, p = 0.03), and ApoB/ApoA-1 ratio (0.8 vs. 0.7, p = 0.03) were higher in hypogonadal compared to eugonadal men, respectively. In adjusted multivariate regression analysis model, testosterone showed negative associations with BMI (β = -1.832, p = 0.030, 95% CI = -3.485--0.180), fasting glucose (β = -0.394, p = 0.011, 95% CI = -0.696--0.091), glucose tolerance test (β = -0.957, p = 0.045, 95% CI = -1.892--0.022), ApoB (β = -0.157, p = 0.017, 95% CI = -0.286--0.029), and ApoB/ApoA-1 ratio (β = -0.118, p = 0.046, 95% CI = -0.234--0.002).These results suggest an inverse association between testosterone levels and risk factors for atherosclerosis.","['Apolipoprotein B', 'Atherosclerosis', 'Hyperlipidemia', 'Hypogonadism']"
Refraction development in anisometropic amblyopia with patching therapy.,"To investigate the development of refraction in anisometropic amblyopia who had been with patching therapy.We retrospectively reviewed 37,528 medical records of the amblyopes who had been treated with patching therapy between July 2003 and January 2020 at the School of Optometry and Ophthalmology and Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. We included unilateral anisometropic amblyopia with a follow-up length of not < 2 years. In total, 371 cases were enrolled and followed up for a mean of 4.76 ± 2.11 years. The subjects were then divided into different groups and periods according to their initial spherical equivalent (SE) refractive error and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of the amblyopic eye. Linear mixed-effects models were fitted to calculate the annual change of SE.The annual changes in SE were -0.32 (-0.35 to -0.30) and -0.16 (-0.19 to -0.14) D/yr for the amblyopic eye and the fellow eye, respectively. The annual changes in SE of amblyopic eyes during the treatment period and the successfully treated period were -0.36 (-0.43 to -0.29; 95% CI) and -0.27 (-0.32 to -0.23; 95% CI) D/yr, respectively; the annual SE changes of the fellow eye during the treatment period and the successfully-treated period were -0.07 (-0.14 to -0.01; 95% CI) and -0.18 (-0.22 to -0.14; 95% CI) D/yr, respectively.The amblyopic eye experienced a significantly greater degree of refractive error changes than the fellow eye and underwent a continuous refractive error reduction before and after 7 years old. After the patching therapy was terminated, emmetropization in the amblyopic eye remained synchronized, whereas the refractive error change was increased in the fellow eye.","['amblyopia', 'anisometropia', 'anisometropic amblyopia', 'emmetropization', 'myopic shift', 'patching therapy']"
Assessment of Vascular Network Connectivity of Hepatocellular Carcinoma Using Graph-Based Approach.,"The angiogenesis of liver cancer is a key condition for its growth, invasion, and metastasis. This study aims to investigate vascular network connectivity of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) using graph-based approach.Orthotopic HCC xenograft models (n=10) and the healthy controls (n=10) were established. After 21 days of modeling, hepatic vascular casting and Micro-CT scanning were performed for angiography, followed by blood vessels automatic segmentation and vascular network modeling. The topologic parameters of vascular network, including clustering coefficient (CC), network structure entropy (NSE), and average path length (APL) were quantified. Topologic parameters of the tumor region, as well as the background liver were compared between HCC group and normal control group.Compared with normal control group, the tumor region of HCC group showed significantly decreased CC [(0.046 ± 0.005) <i>vs.</i> (0.052 ± 0.006), <i>P</i>=0.026], and NSE [(0.9894 ± 0.0015) <i>vs.</i> (0.9927 ± 0.0010), <i>P</i><0.001], and increased APL [(0.433 ± 0.138) <i>vs.</i> (0.188 ± 0.049), <i>P</i><0.001]. Compared with normal control group, the background liver of HCC group showed significantly decreased CC [(0.047 ± 0.004) <i>vs.</i> (0.052 ± 0.006), <i>P</i>=0.041] and increased NSE [0.9938 (0.9936~0.9940) <i>vs.</i> (0.9927 ± 0.0010), <i>P</i>=0.035]. No significant difference was identified for APL between the two groups.Graph-based approach allows quantification of vascular connectivity of HCC. Disrupted vascular topological connectivity exists in the tumor region, as well as the background liver of HCC.","['MicroCT', 'graphbased approach', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'topologic connectivity', 'vascular network']"
Appearance of the levator ani muscle subdivisions on 3D transperineal ultrasound.,"The levator ani muscle (LAM) consists of different subdivisions, which play a specific role in the pelvic floor mechanics. The aim of this study is to identify and describe the appearance of these subdivisions on 3-Dimensional (3D) transperineal ultrasound (TPUS). To do so, a study designed in three phases was performed in which twenty 3D TPUS scans of vaginally nulliparous women were assessed. The first phase was aimed at getting acquainted with the anatomy of the LAM subdivisions and its appearance on TPUS: relevant literature was consulted, and the TPUS scan of one patient was analyzed to identify the puborectal, iliococcygeal, puboperineal, pubovaginal, and puboanal muscle. In the second phase, the five LAM subdivisions and the pubic bone and external sphincter, used as reference structures, were manually segmented in volume data obtained from five nulliparous women at rest. In the third phase, intra- and inter-observer reproducibility were assessed on twenty TPUS scans by measuring the Dice Similarity Index (DSI).The mean inter-observer and median intra-observer DSI values (with interquartile range) were: puborectal 0.83 (0.13)/0.83 (0.10), puboanal 0.70 (0.16)/0.79 (0.09), iliococcygeal 0.73 (0.14)/0.79 (0.10), puboperineal 0.63 (0.25)/0.75 (0.22), pubovaginal muscle 0.62 (0.22)/0.71 (0.16), and the external sphincter 0.81 (0.12)/0.89 (0.03).Our results show that the LAM subdivisions of nulliparous women can be reproducibly identified on 3D TPUS data.","['Levator ani muscle', 'Pelvic floor', 'Segmentation', 'Transperineal ultrasound']"
Physical Aggression and Mindfulness among College Students: Evidence from China and the United States.,"The link between trait mindfulness and several dimensions of aggression (verbal, anger and hostility) has been documented, while the link between physical aggression and trait mindfulness remains less clear.We used two datasets: one United States sample from 300 freshmen males from Clemson University, South Carolina and a Chinese sample of 1516 freshmen students from Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. Multiple regressions were conducted to examine the association between mindfulness (measured by Mindful Attention and Awareness Scale (MAAS)) and each of the four subscales of aggression.Among the Clemson sample (N = 286), the mindfulness scale had a significant negative association with each of the four subscales of aggression: Hostility: β = -0.62, p < 0.001; Verbal: β = -0.37, p < 0.001; Physical: β = -0.29, p < 0.001; Anger: β = -0.44, p < 0.001. Among the Shanghai male subsample, the mindfulness scale had a significant negative association with each of the four subscales of aggression: Hostility: β = -0.57, p < 0.001; Verbal: β = -0.37, p < 0.001; Physical: β = -0.35, p < 0.001; Anger: β = -0.58, p < 0.001. Among the Shanghai female subsample (N = 512), the mindfulness scale had a significant negative association with each of the four subscales of aggression: Hostility: β = -0.62, p < 0.001; Verbal: β = -0.41, p < 0.001; Physical: β = -0.52, p < 0.001; and Anger: β = -0.64, p < 0.001.Our study documents the negative association between mindfulness and physical aggression in two non-clinical samples. Future studies could explore whether mindfulness training lowers physical aggression among younger adults.","['China', 'adolescents', 'aggression', 'college', 'mindfulness', 'younger adults']"
Atropine 0.01% eye drops slow myopia progression: a systematic review and Meta-analysis.,"To evaluate the effects of atropine 0.01% on slowing myopia progression.We searched for relevant studies in the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Embase, Ovid, CBM, CNKI, VIP and Wan Fang Data in Chinese. A supplementary search was conducted in OpenGrey (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe), the ISRCTN registry, ClinicalTrials.gov, and the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) from the dates of inception to June 30, 2018.Seven randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with a total of 1079 subjects were included (505 in the atropine 0.01% group and 574 in the control group). The results showed that the atropine 0.01% group exhibited significantly greater control of axial growth than the control group [MD=-0.12, 95%CI (-0.19, -0.06)]. There was also a statistically significant difference between the atropine 0.01% and control groups in the changes in axial length [MD=-0.14, 95%CI (-0.25, -0.03)], but the quality of evidence was low. There were no significant differences between the atropine 0.01% and control groups in the overall effect with respect to diopter value, change in diopter, distance vision and intraocular pressure [MD=0.08, 95%CI (-0.27, 0.42); MD=0.09, 95%CI (-0.17, 0.36); MD= -0.01, 95%CI (-0.02, 0.00); MD=0.08, 95%CI (-0.56,0.40)]. The sensitivity analysis showed that the conclusion of the Meta-analysis is relatively stable. With respect to adverse events, there were significant differences between the atropine 0.01% and control groups [OR=0.26, 95%CI (0.11, 0.61)].Based on the available evidence, atropine 0.01% eye drops offer benefits in controlling axial growth and safety without causing significant differences in diopter values, distance vision and intraocular pressure.","['Metaanalysis', 'atropine 001 eye drops', 'myopia', 'systematic review']"
The effects of plyometric jump training on lower-limb stiffness in healthy individuals: A meta-analytical comparison.,"This study aimed to examine the effects of plyometric jump training (PJT) on lower-limb stiffness.Systematic searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. Study participants included healthy males and females who undertook a PJT programme isolated from any other training type.There was a small effect size (ES) of PJT on lower-limb stiffness (ES = 0.33, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.07-0.60, z = 2.47, p = 0.01). Untrained individuals exhibited a larger ES (ES = 0.46, 95%CI: 0.08-0.84, p = 0.02) than trained individuals (ES = 0.15, 95%CI: ‒0.23 to 0.53, p = 0.45). Interventions lasting a greater number of weeks (>7 weeks) had a larger ES (ES = 0.47, 95%CI: 0.06-0.88, p = 0.03) than those lasting fewer weeks (ES = 0.22, 95%CI: ‒0.12 to 0.55, p = 0.20). Programmes with ≤2 sessions per week exhibited a larger ES (ES = 0.39, 95%CI: 0.01-0.77, p = 0.04) than programmes that incorporated >2 sessions per week (ES = 0.20, 95%CI: -0.10 to 0.50, p = 0.18). Programmes with <250 jumps per week (ES = 0.50, 95%CI: 0.02-0.97, p = 0.04) showed a larger effect than programmes with 250-500 jumps per week (ES = 0.36, 95%CI: 0.00-0.72, p = 0.05). Programmes with >500 jumps per week had negative effects (ES = -0.22, 95%CI: -1.10 to 0.67, p = 0.63). Programmes with >7.5 jumps per set showed larger effect sizes (ES = 0.55, 95%CI: 0.02-1.08, p = 0.04) than those with <7.5 jumps per set (ES = 0.32, 95%CI: 0.01-0.62, p = 0.04).PJT enhances lower-body stiffness, which can be optimised with lower volumes (<250 jumps per week) over a relatively long period of time (>7 weeks).","['Jumps', 'Stretch shortening cycle', 'Tendon']"
Vitamin K1 ameliorates lipopolysaccharide-triggered skeletal muscle damage revealed by faecal bacteria transplantation.,"Sepsis-associated muscle weakness is common in patients of intensive care units (ICUs), and it is closely associated with poor outcomes. The mechanism of sepsis-induced muscle weakness is unclear. Recent studies have found that gut microbiota and metabolites are involved in the regulation of skeletal muscle mass and metabolism. This study aimed to investigate the effects of gut microbiota and metabolites on sepsis-associated muscle weakness.In a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation mouse model, mice with different sensitivities to LPS-induced inflammation were considered as donor mice for the faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) assay, and recipient mice were divided into sensitive (Sen) and resistant (Res) groups. Skeletal muscle mass and function, as well as colonic barrier integrity were tested and gut microbiota and metabolite composition were analysed in both groups of mice. The effect of intestinal differential metabolite vitamin K1 on LPS-triggered muscle damage was investigated, and the underlying mechanism was explored.Recipients exhibited varying LPS-triggered muscle damage and intestinal barrier disruption. Tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of Sen exhibited upregulated expression levels of MuRF-1 (0.825 ± 0.063 vs. 0.304 ± 0.293, P = 0.0141) and MAFbx (1.055 ± 0.079 vs. 0.456 ± 0.3, P = 0.0092). Colonic tight junction proteins ZO-1 (0.550 ± 0.087 vs. 0.842 ± 0.094, P = 0.0492) and occludin (0.284 ± 0.057 vs. 0.664 ± 0.191, P = 0.0487) were significantly downregulated in the Sen group. Metabolomic analysis showed significantly higher vitamin K1 in the faeces (P = 0.0195) and serum of the Res group (P = 0.0079) than those of the Sen group. After vitamin K1 intervention, muscle atrophy-related protein expression downregulated (P < 0.05). Meanwhile SIRT1 protein expression were upregulated (0.320 ± 0.035 vs. 0.685 ± 0.081, P = 0.0281) and pNF-κB protein expression were downregulated (0.815 ± 0.295 vs. 0.258 ± 0.130, P = 0.0308). PI3K (0.365 ± 0.142 vs. 0.763 ± 0.013, P = 0.0475), pAKT (0.493 ± 0.159 vs. 1.183 ± 0.344, P = 0.0254) and pmTOR (0.509 ± 0.088 vs. 1.110 ± 0.190, P = 0.0368) protein expression levels were upregulated in TA muscle. Meanwhile, vitamin K1 attenuated serum inflammatory factor levels.Vitamin K1 might ameliorate LPS-triggered skeletal muscle damage by antagonizing NF-κB-mediated inflammation through upregulation of SIRT1 and regulating the balance between protein synthesis and catabolism.","['Gut microbiota', 'Inflammation', 'Muscle weakness', 'SIRT1', 'Sepsis', 'Vitamin K1']"
Utility of the END-IT Score to Predict the outcome of Childhood Status Epilepticus: A Retrospective Cohort Study.,"Scoring systems to predict outcomes in pediatric status epilepticus (SE) are limited. We sought to assess usefulness of the END-IT score in pediatric SE.We conducted a retrospective study at a tertiary hospital in New Delhi, India. Children aged 1 month-18 years who presented with seizure for ≥5 min/actively convulsing to emergency were enrolled. END-IT score was calculated and correlated with outcome at discharge using Pediatric Overall Performance Category (POPC) scale, in-hospital mortality, and progression to refractory and super-refractory SE (SRSE).We enrolled 140 children (mean age 5.8 years; 67.1% males). Seven children died and 15 had unfavorable outcomes. The predictive accuracy of END-IT at a cutoff of > 2: for unfavorable outcome (POPC score ≥3) was: sensitivity 0.73 (95% CI: 0.45-0.92), specificity 0.94 (95% CI: 0.89-0.98), PPV 0.61 (95% CI: 0.36-0.83), NPV 0.97 (95% CI: 0.92-0.99), positive likelihood ratio (13.09), F1 score (0.666); for death: sensitivity 0.86 (95% CI: 0.42-0.99), specificity 0.91 (95% CI: 0.85-0.95), PPV 0.33 (95% CI: 0.13-0.59), NPV 0.99 (95% CI: 0.96-1.00), F1 score (0.48); for RSE: sensitivity 0.80 (95%CI: 0.28-0.99), specificity 0.90 (95% CI: 0.83-0.94), PPV 0.22 (95% CI: 0.06-0.48) NPV 0.99 (95% CI: 0.96-1.00), F1 score (0.35); for SRSE: sensitivity 0.67 (95% CI: 0.22-0.96) specificity 0.75 (95% CI: 0.66-0.82), PPV 0.22 (95% CI: 0.06-0.48) NPV 0.98 (95% CI: 0.94-0.99), F1 score (0.33).We demonstrate utility of the END-IT score to predict short-term outcomes as well as progression to refractory and SRSE for the first time among children with SE.","['Epidemiologybased Mortality Score in Status Epilepticus', 'Status Epilepticus Severity Score', 'pediatrics', 'prognosis', 'refractory status epilepticus']"
Investigation of the combination of intratumoral and peritumoral radiomic signatures for predicting epidermal growth factor receptor mutation in lung adenocarcinoma.,"We investigated optimal peritumoral size and constructed predictive models for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation.A total of 164 patients with lung adenocarcinoma were retrospectively analyzed. Radiomic signatures for the intratumoral region and combinations of intratumoral and peritumoral regions (3, 5, and 7 mm) from computed tomography images were extracted using analysis of variance and least absolute shrinkage. The optimal peritumoral region was determined by radiomics score (rad-score). Intratumoral radiomic signatures with clinical features (IRS) were used to construct predictive models for EGFR mutation. Combinations of intratumoral and 3, 5, or 7 mm-peritumoral signatures with clinical features (IPRS3, IPRS5, and IPRS7, respectively) were also used to construct predictive models. Support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and LightGBM models with five-fold cross-validation were constructed, and the receiver operating characteristics were evaluated. Area under the curve (AUC) of the training and test cohorts values were calculated. Brier scores (BS) and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate the predictive models.The AUC values of the SVM, LR, and LightGBM models derived from IRS were 0.783 (95% confidence interval: 0.602-0.956), 0.789 (0.654-0.927), and 0.735 (0.613-0.958) for training, and 0.791 (0.641-0.920), 0.781 (0.538-0.930), and 0.734 (0.538-0.930) for test cohort, respectively. Rad-score confirmed that the 3 mm-peritumoral size was optimal (IPRS3), and AUCs values of SVM, LR, and lightGBM models derived from IPRS3 were 0.831 (0.666-0.984), 0.804 (0.622-0.908), and 0.769 (0.628-0.921) for training and 0.765 (0.644-0.921), 0.783 (0.583-0.921), and 0.796 (0.583-0.949) for test cohort, respectively. The BS and DCA of the LR and LightGBM models derived from IPRS3 were better than those from IRS.Accordingly, the combination of intratumoral and 3 mm-peritumoral radiomic signatures may be helpful for predicting EGFR mutations.","['EGFR mutation', 'machine learning', 'radiomic feature']"
Systemic Inflammation Is Associated With Longitudinal Changes in Cognitive Performance Among Urban Adults.,"<b>Objectives/Background:</b> Systemic inflammation can affect cognitive performance over time. The current study examined associations between systemic inflammation and cognitive performance among African Americans and Whites urban adults, stratifying by sex, and age group and by race. <b>Patients/Methods:</b> Among 1,555-1,719 White and African-American urban adults [Age<sub>base</sub>: 30-64y, 2004-2013, mean±SD follow-up time(y): 4.64 ± 0.93y], conducted linear mixed-effects regression models were conducted to test associations of inflammatory markers [C-reactive protein, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR), albumin, iron, and an inflammation composite score (ICS)] with longitudinal cognitive performance. <b>Results:</b> Among key findings, CRP was linked to poorer baseline mental status among younger women (≤50y, γ<sub>01</sub> = -0.03 ± 0.01<i>, p</i> = 0.002) and poorer attention in older women (>50y, γ<sub>01</sub> = -0.024 ± 0.007<i>, p</i> < 0.004) and African-Americans (γ<sub>01</sub> = -0.029 ± 0.008<i>, p</i> < 0.001).

Albumin was linked to slower attention decline among older men (>50y, γ<sub>11</sub> = +0.329 ± 0.103, <i>P</i> = 0.009), over-time improvement in executive function overall (γ<sub>11</sub> = -6.00 ± 2.26<i>, P</i> = 0.008), and better baseline psychomotor speed among African-Americans (γ<sub>01</sub> = +0.56 ± 0.19<i>, P</i> = 0.003). Finally, ICS predicted faster decline on visual memory/visuo-constructive abilities among older men (>50y, γ<sub>11</sub> = +0.17 ± 0.06<i>, p</i> = 0.003). <b>Conclusion:</b> In sum, strong associations between systemic inflammation and longitudinal cognitive performance were detected, largely among older individuals (>50y) and African-Americans. Randomized trials targeting inflammation are warranted.","['Creactive protein CRP', 'cognitive performance', 'inflammation', 'serum biomarkers', 'urban adults']"
The clinical role of microRNA-21 as a promising biomarker in the diagnosis and prognosis of colorectal cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This systematic analysis aimed to investigate the value of microRNA-21 (miR-21) in colorectal cancer for multiple purposes, including diagnosis and prognosis, as well as its predictive power in combination biomarkers. Fifty-seven eligible studies were included in our meta-analysis, including 25 studies for diagnostic meta-analysis and 32 for prognostic meta-analysis. For the diagnostic meta-analysis of miR-21 alone, the overall pooled results for sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were 0.64 (95% CI: 0.53-0.74), 0.85 (0.79-0.90), and 0.85 (0.81-0.87), respectively. Circulating samples presented corresponding values of 0.72 (0.63-0.79), 0.84 (0.78-0.89), and 0.86 (0.83-0.89), respectively. For the diagnostic meta-analysis of miR-21-related combination biomarkers, the above three parameters were 0.79 (0.69-0.86), 0.79 (0.68-0.87), and 0.86 (0.83-0.89), respectively. Notably, subgroup analysis suggested that miRNA combination markers in circulation exhibited high predictive power, with sensitivity of 0.85 (0.70-0.93), specificity of 0.86 (0.77-0.92), and AUC of 0.92 (0.89-0.94). For the prognostic meta-analysis, patients with higher expression of miR-21 had significant shorter disease-free survival [DFS; pooled hazard ratio (HR): 1.60; 95% CI: 1.20-2.15] and overall survival (OS; 1.54; 1.27-1.86). The combined HR in tissues for DFS and OS were 1.76 (1.31-2.36) and 1.58 (1.30-1.93), respectively. Our comprehensive systematic review revealed that circulating miR-21 may be suitable as a diagnostic biomarker, while tissue miR-21 could be a prognostic marker for colorectal cancer. In addition, miRNA combination biomarkers may provide a new approach for clinical application.","['colorectal cancer', 'diagnosis', 'metaanalysis', 'miR21', 'prognosis']"
Improvement of differential diagnosis of lung cancer by use of multiple protein tumor marker combinations.,"Differential diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in hospitalized patients is crucial for appropriate treatment choice.To investigate the relevance of serum tumor markers (STMs) and their combinations for the differentiation of NSCLC and SCLC subtypes.Between 2000 and 2003, 10 established STMs were assessed retrospectively in 311 patients with NSCLC, 128 with SCLC prior systemic first-line therapy and 51 controls with benign lung diseases (BLD), by automatized electrochemiluminescence immunoassay technology. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and logistic regression analyses were used to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of both individual and multiple STMs with corresponding sensitivities at 90% specificity. Standards for Reporting of Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD guidelines) were followed.CYFRA 21-1 (cytokeratin-19 fragment), CEA (carcinoembryonic antigen) and NSE (neuron specific enolase) were significantly higher in all lung cancers vs BLD, reaching AUCs of 0.81 (95% CI 0.76-0.87), 0.78 (0.73-0.84), and 0.88 (0.84-0.93), respectively. By the three marker combination, the discrimination between benign and all malignant cases was improved resulting in an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI 0.90-0.96). In NSCLC vs. BLD, CYFRA 21-1, CEA and NSE were best discriminative STMs, with AUCs of 0.86 (95% CI 0.81-0.91), 0.80 (0.74-0.85), and 0.85 (0.79-0.91). The three marker combination also improved the AUC: 0.92; 95% CI 0.89-0.96). In SCLC vs. BLD, ProGRP (pro-gastrin-releasing peptide) and NSE were best discriminative STMs, with AUCs of 0.89 (95% CI 0.84-0.94) and 0.96 (0.93-0.98), respectively, and slightly improved AUC of 0.97 (95% CI 0.95-0.99) when in combination. Finally, discrimination between SCLC and NSCLC was possible by ProGRP (AUC 0.86; 95% CI 0.81-0.91), NSE (AUC 0.83; 0.78-0.88) and CYFRA 21-1 (AUC 0.69; 0.64-0.75) and by the combination of the 3 STMs (AUC 0.93; 0.91-0.96), with a sensitivity of 88% at 90% specificity.The results confirm the power of STM combinations for the differential diagnosis of lung cancer from benign lesions and between histological lung cancer subtypes.","['AUC', 'CA 125', 'CA 153', 'CA 199', 'CA 724', 'CEA', 'CYFRA 211', 'NSCLC', 'NSE', 'ProGRP', 'S100', 'SCC', 'SCLC', 'Tumor markers', 'differential diagnosis', 'histology', 'lung cancer', 'sensitivity', 'specificity']"
Validity and reliability of short-term heart-rate variability from disposable electrocardiography leads.,"Single-use electrocardiography (ECG) leads have been developed to reduce healthcare-associated infection. This study compared the validity and reliability of short-term heart rate variability (HRV) obtained from single-use disposable ECG leads.Thirty healthy subjects (33 ± 10 years; 9 females) underwent 5-min resting HRV assessments using disposable (single use) ECG cable and wire system (Kendall DL™ Cardinal Health) and a standard, reusable ECG leads (CardioExpress, Spacelabs Healthcare).Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with 95% confidence interval (CI) between disposable and reusable ECG leads was for the time domain [R-R interval (ms); 0.99 (0.91, 1.00)], the root mean square of successive normal R-R interval differences (RMSSD) (ms); 0.91 (0.76, 0.96), the SD of normal-to-normal R-R intervals (SDNN) (ms); 0.91 (0.68, 0.97) and frequency domain [low-frequency (LF) normalized units (nu); 0.90 (0.79, 0.95), high frequency (HF) nu; 0.91 (0.80, 0.96), LF power (ms<sup>2</sup>); 0.89 (0.62, 0.96), HF power (ms<sup>2</sup>); 0.90 (0.72, 0.96)] variables. The mean difference and upper and lower limits of agreement between disposable and reusable leads for time- and frequency-domain variables were acceptable. Analysis of repeated measures using disposable leads demonstrated excellent reproducibility (ICC 95% CI) for R-R interval (ms); 0.93 (0.85, 0.97), RMSSD (ms); 0.93 (0.85, 0.97), SDNN (ms); 0.88 (0.75, 0.95), LF power (ms<sup>2</sup>); 0.87 (0.72, 0.94), and HF power (ms<sup>2</sup>); 0.88 (0.73, 0.94) with coefficient of variation ranging from 2.2% to 5% (<i>p</i> > 0.37 for all variables).Single-use Kendall DL™ ECG leads demonstrate a valid and reproducible tool for the assessment of HRV.","['ECG', 'disposable leads', 'heart rate variability', 'reproducibility', 'validity']"
Value of intravoxel incoherent motion in detecting and staging liver fibrosis: A meta-analysis.,"Liver fibrosis (LF) is a common pathological feature of all chronic liver diseases. With the accumulation of extracellular matrix in the fibrotic liver, true molecular water diffusion and perfusion-related diffusion are restricted. Intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) can capture the information on tissue diffusivity and microcapillary perfusion separately and reflect the fibrotic severity with diffusion coefficients.To investigate the diagnostic performance of IVIM in detecting and staging LF with histology as a reference standard.A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify studies on the diagnostic accuracy of IVIM for assessment of histologically proven LF. The stages of LF were classified as F0 (no fibrosis), F1 (portal fibrosis without septa), F2 (periportal fibrosis with few septa), F3 (septal fibrosis), and F4 (cirrhosis) according to histopathological findings. Data were extracted to calculate the pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios, and diagnostic odds ratio, as well as the area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in each group.A total of 12 studies with 923 subjects were included in this meta-analysis with 5 studies (<i>n</i> = 465) for LF ≥ F1, 9 studies (<i>n</i> = 757) for LF ≥ F2, 4 studies (<i>n</i> = 413) for LF ≥ F3, and 6 studies (<i>n</i> = 562) for LF = F4. The pooled sensitivity and specificity were estimated to be 0.78 (95% confidence interval: 0.73-0.82) and 0.81 (0.74-0.86) for LF ≥ F1 detection with IVIM; 0.82 (0.79-0.86) and 0.80 (0.75-0.84) for staging F2 fibrosis; 0.85 (0.79-0.90) and 0.83 (0.77-0.87) for staging F3 fibrosis, and 0.90 (0.84-0.94) and 0.75 (0.70-0.79) for detecting F4 cirrhosis, respectively. The AUCs for LF ≥ F1, F2, F3, F4 detection were 0.862 (0.811-0.914), 0.883 (0.856-0.909), 0.886 (0.865-0.907), and 0.899 (0.866-0.932), respectively. Moderate to substantial heterogeneity was observed with inconsistency index (<i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>) ranging from 0% to 77.9%. No publication bias was detected.IVIM is a noninvasive tool with good diagnostic performance in detecting and staging LF. Optimized and standardized IVIM protocols are needed to further improve its diagnostic accuracy in clinical practice.","['Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging', 'Diffusion weight imaging', 'Intravoxel incoherent motion', 'Liver cirrhosis', 'Liver fibrosis', 'Metaanalysis']"
Effect of lifestyle intervention on the reproductive endocrine profile in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) affects 18-22% of women at reproductive age. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the expected benefits of lifestyle (exercise plus diet) interventions on the reproductive endocrine profile in women with PCOS. Potential studies were identified by systematically searching PubMed, CINAHL and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Registry (1966-April 30, 2013) systematically using key concepts of PCOS. Significant improvements were seen in women receiving lifestyle intervention vs usual care in follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels, mean difference (MD) 0.39 IU/l (95% CI 0.09 to 0.70, P=0.01), sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, MD 2.37 nmol/l (95% CI 1.27 to 3.47, P<0.0001), total testosterone levels, MD -0.13 nmol/l (95% CI -0.22 to -0.03, P=0.008), androstenedione levels, MD -0.09 ng/dl (95% CI -0.15 to -0.03, P=0.005), free androgen index (FAI) levels, MD -1.64 (95% CI -2.94 to -0.35, P=0.01) and Ferriman-Gallwey (FG) score, MD -1.01 (95% CI -1.54 to -0.48, P=0.0002). Significant improvements were also observed in women who received exercise-alone intervention vs usual care in FSH levels, MD 0.42 IU/l (95% CI 0.11 to 0.73, P=0.009), SHBG levels, MD 3.42 nmol/l (95% CI 0.11 to 6.73, P=0.04), total testosterone levels, MD -0.16 nmol/l (95% CI -0.29 to -0.04, P=0.01), androstenedione levels, MD -0.09 ng/dl (95% CI -0.16 to -0.03, P=0.004) and FG score, MD -1.13 (95% CI -1.88 to -0.38, P=0.003). Our analyses suggest that lifestyle (diet and exercise) intervention improves levels of FSH, SHBG, total testosterone, androstenedione and FAI, and FG score in women with PCOS.","['exercise', 'female reproduction', 'folliclestimulating hormone', 'insulin resistance', 'luteinizing hormone', 'polycystic ovarian syndrome']"
Canonical Correlation Between Self-Care Agency and Health-Related Self-Efficacy with Chronic Viral Hepatitis Patients.,"The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between self-care agency and health self-efficacy measures, in patients with viral hepatitis.Data were collected from 116 outpatients over the age of 19 years who were diagnosed with viral hepatitis between February 20, 2019 and April 30, 2019. This study used the Appraisal of Self-care Agency Scale-Revised and the Health Self-Efficacy measures. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficients, and canonical correlations were used during data analysis [SPSS version 25.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA)].The first canonical correlation coefficient was 0.65 (Wilks' λ = 0.44, F = 5.63, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and the second was 0.42 (Wilks' λ = 0.76, F = 3.08, <i>p</i> = .001). The first variate indicated a higher perception of having power for self-care (0.85) and developing power for self-care (0.92), and this was related to exercise (0.66), illness (0.76), emotion (0.75), nutrition (0.81), stress (0.60), and health practice (0.85). The second variate indicated a higher perception of having power for self-care (0.42), whilst lacking power for self-care (-0.82), was related to illness (0.35) and stress (0.72).Nursing interventions and education aimed at enhancing the self-care of viral hepatitis patients are needed to assist patients to improve their health care behaviors.","['health', 'hepatitis', 'selfcare']"
The effectiveness of remote delivered intervention for loneliness reduction in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Remotely delivered intervention is widely applied to loneliness treatment in older adults, but the effect is controversial. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of remotely delivered intervention on loneliness using a systematic review and meta-analysis.The PubMed, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, EMBASE, CINAHL (EBSCO), PsycINFO (EBSCO) databases were searched for studies, the search ended on 7 July 2021. Thirteen randomized controlled trials of remotely delivered intervention compared with usual care, brief contact, or no intervention for loneliness were included. A random-effects model measured estimation of loneliness reduction. Furthermore, standardized mean differences (SMDs), 95% confidence intervals (CIs), publication bias, and heterogeneity were calculated. Subgroup analysis was used to explore the factors that might affect the treatment effects.The evidence of remotely delivered intervention on loneliness reduction was certain (SMD = -0.41 [95% CI, -0.70 to -0.13]). Media subgroup analysis supported the effectiveness of intervention delivered by video call (SMD = -0.54 [95% CI, -0.83 to -0.25]); treatment strategy subgroup analysis found evidence to support the effectiveness of increasing social support and maladaptive social cognition treatment strategy (SMD = -0.47 [95% CI, -0.77 to -0.18] and SMD = -1.04 [95% CI, -1.98 to -0.10], respectively); participants subgroup analysis shown the effectiveness of intervention for older adults living in LTC and social isolation (SMD = -1.40 [95% CI, -2.43 to -0.36] and SMD = -0.55 [95% CI, -0.74 to -0.36], respectively); group format subgroup analysis testified the effectiveness of intervention carried out in individual format (SMD = -0.39 [95% CI, -0.71 to -0.07]); measurement time points subgroup analysis found the positive effect of intervention at 3 months and 3 to 6 months stage (SMD = -0.33 [95% CI, -0.52 to -0.14] and SMD = -0.32 [95% CI, -0.57 to -0.07], respectively). Significant publication bias was detected (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and the heterogeneity of the studies was substantial.This systematic review and meta-analysis demonstrate that remotely delivered intervention can reduce loneliness in older adults, and it appears to be affected by media type, treatment strategy, participants characteristics, group format, and measurement time points.","['loneliness', 'metaanalysis', 'older adults', 'remote delivered intervention', 'systematic review']"
Prospective associations of age at complementary feeding and exclusive breastfeeding duration with body mass index at 5-6 years within different risk groups.,"Children with overweight or obesity are at risk for developing obesity in adulthood. Certain maternal characteristics, such as ethnicity, education, body mass index (BMI) or neighbourhood, are determinants for childhood overweight risk. There are large variations in how mothers differing in these characteristics feed their infants. Therefore, associations of age at complementary feeding, exclusive breast feeding duration with childhood overweight may differ in these groups. Understanding these associations would be essential to develop overweight prevention strategies.The objective of this study is to study the associations of age at complementary feeding, exclusive breastfeeding duration with BMI-standard deviation score (SDS) at 5-6 years within risk groups.Using data from the Amsterdam Born Children and their Development study, a population-based birth cohort (n = 4495), we formed groups of children at varying risk of overweight according to maternal characteristics of ethnicity, education, pre-pregnancy BMI and neighbourhood. Linear and logistic regression analyses were conducted.Complementary feeding after 5 months of age was associated with lower BMI-SDS in children of mothers of Dutch ethnicity (B: -0.12; 95% CI: -0.21, -0.04), medium-level education (-0.19; -0.30, -0.08), normal BMI (-0.08; -0.16, -0.01) and high-risk neighbourhood (-0.16; -0.29, -0.02). Compared with exclusive breastfeeding for <3 months, exclusive breastfeeding for ≥6 months was associated with lower BMI-SDS in groups of medium-level education (-0.28; 0.44, -0.11), normal BMI (-0.18; -0.29, -0.08) and medium-risk (-0.18; -0.33, -0.04) and high-risk (-0.22; -0.42, -0.02) neighbourhoods.Associations between infant feeding practices and childhood BMI may differ between risk groups, implying that overweight prevention strategies should be group-specific.","['BMI', 'Breastfeeding', 'childhood overweight', 'complementary feeding', 'weaning']"
"The relationship between intake of fruits, vegetables and dairy products with overweight and obesity in a large sample in Iran: Findings of STEPS 2016.","The present study aimed to investigate the association between fruits and vegetables (FVs) and dairy product intake with body weight based on the data from the nationwide Stepwise approach to surveillance (STEPS) survey in Iran.STEPS is a national-based cross-sectional study conducted on 3,0541 people selected by stratified cluster random sampling in Iran from April to November 2016. The outcome of the current study was body mass index (BMI) which was classified as normal weight, underweight, overweight, and obese. Also, as exposure variables, dietary intakes of fruits, vegetables and dairy products were extracted from the STEPS questionnaires. Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between dairy products, FVs consumption, and BMI category in the crude and adjusted models.In the adjusted model, we observed 41% [odd ratio (OR) = 0.59; 95% confidence intervals (CI): 0.50, 0.68, P < 0.001], 27% (OR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.84, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and 26% (OR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.63, 0.87, <i>P</i> < 0.001) lower odds of being overweight, and 46% (OR = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.46, 0.64, <i>P</i> < 0.001), 29% (OR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.60, 0.84, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and 21% (OR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.65, 0.95, <i>P</i> = 0.014) decrease in obesity odds among the participants who consumed 1, 2, and more than 2 servings of fruits per day in comparison to less than one serving, respectively. Also, we observed participants who consumed 1, 2, and more than 2 servings in comparison to less than one serving of dairy products per day had 31% (OR = 0.69; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.81, <i>P</i> < 0.001), 23% (OR = 0.77; 95 %CI: 0.65, 0.91, <i>P</i> = 0.002), and 21% (OR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.67, 0.94, <i>P</i> = 0.011) lower odds of being overweight and 47% (OR = 0.53; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.64, <i>P</i> < 0.001), 36% (OR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.53, 0.77, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and 32% (OR = 0.68; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.83, <i>P</i> < 0.001) lower odds of obesity, respectively. In addition, compared to participants who consumed less than 2 servings of vegetables per day, participants who consumed 2, 3, and more than 3 servings had 40% (OR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.47, 0.76, <i>P</i> < 0.001), 29% (OR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.90, <i>P</i> = 0.006), and 26% (OR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.96, <i>P</i> = 0.027) lower odds of being overweight, respectively. Furthermore, we observed 36% lower odds of obesity among participants who ate 2 servings of vegetables per day compared to less than 2 serving (OR = 0.64; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.84, <i>P</i> = 0.002).Our findings showed that intake of FVs and dairy products is associated with a healthier weight status in adults. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings.","['STEPS', 'dairy', 'fruits', 'obesity', 'overweight', 'vegetable']"
Biomechanical testing of a modified knotless transscleral suture fixation technique: an <i>ex vivo</i> study.,"To investigate the safety and effectiveness of a modified transscleral suture through <i>ex vivo</i> tests.<i>Ex vivo</i> tests were performed in full-thickness porcine scleral pieces using modified knotless transscleral zigzag-shaped suture (Z-suture) fixation technology. The minimum traction force required to loosen or rupture the suture was assessed. The effects of different polypropylene sutures (10-0, 8-0), different suture spans (2.0, 3.0, 4.0 mm), different passes (3, 4, 5 passes), and scleral grooves were investigated.The average minimum traction forces required to loosen 10-0 polypropylene sutured for 3.0 mm with a suture span of 3, 4, and 5 passes, were 0.18 (0.15-0.18), 0.22 (0.21-0.22), and 0.37 (0.37-0.37) N, respectively. The maximum traction force to prevent the suture from rupturing for the 10-0 polypropylene suture was 0.37-0.41 N in the sclera. The average of the minimum traction forces required to loosen the 8-0 polypropylene sutured with 5 passes and spanning 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 mm were 0.37 (0.3 -0.39), 0.42 (0.42-0.45), and 0.50 (0.50-0.51) N, respectively, which were 14-28% higher than that of the 10-0 polypropylene suture under same conditions (all P values <0.01). In addition, there was no statistical difference (P=0.3258) for the 8-0 polypropylene suture used with a 3.0-mm suture span and 5 passes between conditions with or without scleral grooves.The minimum traction force required to loosen or rupture the suture in the sclera was associated with suture specification, suture span, and the number of passes, but was uncorrelated with double scleral grooves. The 8-0 polypropylene suture with double scleral grooves may be a more favorable choice for knotless transscleral fixation.","['Biomechanical test', 'Zsuture', 'modified surgery', 'transscleral fixation']"
Neuropsychological Performance Among Individuals at Clinical High-Risk for Psychosis vs Putatively Low-Risk Peers With Other Psychopathology: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Youth at clinical high-risk (CHR) for psychosis present with neuropsychological impairments relative to healthy controls (HC), but whether these impairments are distinguishable from those seen among putatively lower risk peers with other psychopathology remains unknown. We hypothesized that any excess impairment among CHR cohorts beyond that seen in other clinical groups is minimal and accounted for by the proportion who transition to psychosis (CHR-T).We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies comparing cognitive performance among CHR youth to clinical comparators (CC) who either sought mental health services but did not meet CHR criteria or presented with verified nonpsychotic psychopathology.Twenty-one studies were included representing nearly 4000 participants. Individuals at CHR showed substantial cognitive impairments relative to HC (eg, global cognition: g = -0.48 [-0.60, -0.34]), but minimal impairments relative to CC (eg, global cognition: g = -0.13 [-0.20, -0.06]). Any excess impairment among CHR was almost entirely attributable to CHR-T; impairment among youth at CHR without transition (CHR-NT) was typically indistinguishable from CC (eg, global cognition, CHR-T: g = -0.42 [-0.64, -0.19], CHR-NT: g = -0.09 [-0.18, 0.00]; processing speed, CHR-T: g = -0.59 [-0.82, -0.37], CHR-NT: g = -0.12 [-0.25, 0.07]; working memory, CHR-T: g = -0.42 [-0.62, -0.22], CHR-NT: g = -0.03 [-0.14, 0.08]).Neurocognitive impairment in CHR cohorts should be interpreted cautiously when psychosis or even CHR status is the specific clinical syndrome of interest as these impairments most likely represent a transdiagnostic vs psychosis-specific vulnerability.","['clinical staging', 'developmental psychopathology', 'neurocognitive', 'schizophrenia', 'transdiagnostic']"
Effects of Chinese herbal medicine Xiangbin prescription on gastrointestinal motility.,"To investigate the effects of Xiangbin prescription (XBP), a Chinese herbal concoction, on gastrointestinal motility.Forty healthy volunteers were recruited for this randomized controlled trial of XBP. Antroduodenojejunal manometry was used to monitor gastrointestinal motility in these subjects. After the subjects had fasted for at least 12 h, XBP (<i>n</i> = 30) or placebo (<i>n</i> = 10) was orally administrated and gastrointestinal motility was recorded for 4 h. Plasma motilin and ghrelin were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Oral administration of XBP significantly increased the amplitude of duodenal contractions [19.5 (13.0-26.7) <i>vs</i> 16.9 (12.3-23.9), <i>P</i> < 0.05], jejunal contractions [18.3 (15.3-25.0) <i>vs</i> 15.4 (11.7-23.9), <i>P</i> < 0.01], and the motility index of duodenal contractions [522.0 (146.0-139.0) <i>vs</i> 281.0 (76.5-1006.0), <i>P</i> < 0.01] in phase II of the migratory motor complex (MMC), which subsequently initiated the MMC cycle [74.0 (30.0-118.0) <i>vs</i> 116.5 (24.0-219.0), <i>P</i> < 0.05], shortened the duration of phase I of the MMC [42.0 (0.0-90.0) <i>vs</i> 111.5 (42.0-171.0), <i>P</i> < 0.01], and lengthened the duration of phase II of the MMC [120 (21-240) <i>vs</i> 58 (16-170), <i>P</i> < 0.01] compared to the duration before XBP administration. There were significant differences in the amplitude of jejunal contractions [19.8 (14.0-30.0) <i>vs</i> 18.0 (13.0-28.5), <i>P</i> < 0.05], the motility index of duodenal contractions [236.0 (115.0-306.0) <i>vs</i> 195.0 (109.0-310.0), <i>P</i> < 0.05)], and jejunal contractions [214.0 (95.0-403.0) <i>vs</i> 178.0 (55.0-304.0), <i>P</i> < 0.01] in phase III of the MMC. Oral administration of XBP greatly increased plasma motilin (57.69 ± 9.03 <i>vs</i> 49.38 ± 8.63, <i>P</i> < 0.01) and ghrelin (279.20 ± 104.31 <i>vs</i> 238.73 ± 115.59, <i>P</i> < 0.01) concentrations compared to concentrations after oral administration of the placebo.XBP can stimulate duodenal and jejunal motility and increase the concentrations of plasma motilin and ghrelin. The clinical applicability of XBP in treating GDIM deserves investigation.","['Antrotroduodenojejunal manometry', 'Gastrointestinal motility', 'Ghrelin', 'Migrating motor complex', 'Motilin', 'Xiangbin concoction']"
Associations between symptoms with healthcare utilization and death in advanced cancer patients.,"There is limited data about assessments that are associated with increased utilization of medical services among advanced oncology patients (AOPs). We aimed to identify factors related to healthcare utilization and death in AOP.AOPs at a comprehensive cancer center were enrolled in a Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation program. Participants completed the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) and the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General (FACT-G) scale. We examined factors associated with palliative care (PC), acute care (AC), emergency room (ER), hospital admissions (HA), and death.In all, 817 AOPs were included in these analyses with a median age of 69. They were generally female (58.7%), white (61.4%), stage IV (51.6%), and represented common cancers (31.5% GI, 25.2% thoracic, 14.3% gynecologic). ESAS pain, anxiety, and total score were related to more PC visits (B=0.31, 95% CI [0.21, 0.40], p<0.001; B=0.24 [0.12, 0.36], p<0.001; and B=0.038 [0.02, 0.06], p=0.001, respectively). Total FACT-G score and physical subscale were related to total PC visits (B=-0.021 [-0.037, -0.006], p=0.008 and B=-0.181 [-0.246, -0.117], p<0.001, respectively). Lower FACT-G social subscale scores were related to more ER visits (B=-0.03 [-0.53, -0.004], p=0.024), while increased tiredness was associated with fewer AC visits (B=-0.039 [-0.073, -0.006], p=0.023). Higher total ESAS scores were related to death within 30 days (OR=0.87 [0.76, 0.98], p=0.027).The ESAS and FACT-G assessments were linked to PC and AC visits and death. These assessments may be useful for identifying AOPs that would benefit from routine PC.","['Healthcare utilization', 'Palliative care', 'Quality of life', 'Symptom burden']"
Correlation of central field index (10-2 visual field analysis) and activity limitation with increasing severity of glaucoma using glaucoma activity limitation-9 questionnaire.,"The purpose of the study was to analyze the correlation between central field index (CFI) and activity limitation in glaucoma using glaucoma activity limitation-9 (GAL-9) questionnaire.This hospital-based, cross-sectional, noninterventional study, included 50 patients diagnosed with glaucoma, with field defect encroaching onto central 10° in Humphrey field analysis 30-2 program, in at least one eye. These patients underwent central 10-2 field analysis and CFI was calculated with the help of a calculator created by us. Patients with severe cognitive impairment were excluded and the rest completed the GAL-9 questionnaire. The data was analyzed to determine the correlation between the CFI and the GAL-9 scores.There was a moderate correlation between CFI of better eye (r = -0.431, confidence interval ""CI"" -0.619 to -0.173, P < 0.002) and worse eye (r = -0.342, CI: -0.575 to - 0.058, P < 0.015) with GAL-9, the better eye showing a stronger correlation. Mean deviations (MD) of both better (r = -0.345, CI: -0.556 to -0.069, P < 0.014) and worse eye (r = -0.346, CI: -0.578 to -0.063 P < 0.014) showed similar moderate correlation. Vision of better eye (r = -0.398, CI: -0.577 to -0.210, P < 0.004) showed a stronger correlation with GAL-9 score than worse eye (r = -0.188, CI: -0.475 to 0.100, P < 0.192). Subscales of GAL-9 questionnaire also correlated with better eye status. ""Finding dropped objects"" had the strongest correlation to CFI of better eye (r = -0.676) and ""adjusting to dim lights"" had the weakest correlation (r = -0.052).The better eye status in glaucoma patients correlated better than worse eye with regard to activity limitation, signifying that the better eye has a greater influence on the quality of life and how patients perceive their disability. Furthermore, CFI showed a better correlation with GAL-9 score than MD.","['Central field index', 'glaucoma', 'glaucoma activity limitation']"
Effectiveness of psychological treatments for depressive disorders in primary care: systematic review and meta-analysis.,"We performed a systematic review of the currently available evidence on whether psychological treatments are effective for treating depressed primary care patients in comparison with usual care or placebo, taking the type of therapy and its delivery mode into account.Randomized controlled trials comparing a psychological treatment with a usual care or a placebo control in adult, depressed, primary care patients were identified by searches in MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and PsycINFO up to December 2013. At least 2 reviewers extracted information from included studies and assessed the risk of bias. Random effects meta-analyses were performed using posttreatment depression scores as outcome.A total of 30 studies with 5,159 patients met the inclusion criteria. Compared with control, the effect (standardized mean difference) at completion of treatment was -0.30 (95% CI, -0.48 to -0.13) for face-to-face cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), -0.14 (-0.40 to 0.12) for face-to-face problem-solving therapy, -0.24 (-0.47 to -0.02) for face-to-face interpersonal psychotherapy, -0.28 (-0.44 to -0.12) for other face-to-face psychological interventions, -0.43 (-0.62 to -0.24) for remote therapist-led CBT, -0.56 (-1.57 to 0.45) for remote therapist-led problem-solving therapy, -0.40 (-0.69 to -0.11) for guided self-help CBT, and -0.27 (-0.44 to -0.10) for no or minimal contact CBT.There is evidence that psychological treatments are effective in depressed primary care patients. For CBT approaches, substantial evidence suggests that interventions that are less resource intensive might have effects similar to more intense treatments.","['cognitive therapy', 'depression', 'depressive disorders', 'primary health care', 'psychotherapy', 'review', 'systematic', 'therapeutics']"
"Body Adiposity, But Not Elements of Objectively Measured Sedentary Behavior or Physical Activity, Is Associated With Circulating Liver Enzymes in Adults With Overweight and Obesity.","We studied the associations between accelerometer-measured sedentary behavior (SB) and habitual physical activity (PA) as well as markers of body adiposity and other cardiometabolic risk factors with liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and γ-glutamyltransferase (GGT).A total of 144 middle-aged adults (mean age 57 (SD 6.5) years) with overweight or obesity (mean body mass index [BMI] 31.8 [SD 3.9] kg/m<sup>2</sup>) participated. Different components of SB (sitting, lying) and PA (standing, breaks in SB, daily steps, light PA, moderate-to-vigorous PA and total PA) were measured with validated hip-worn accelerometers for four consecutive weeks (mean 25 days, [SD 4]). Fasting venous blood samples were analysed using standard assays. The associations were examined with Pearson's partial correlation coefficient test and linear mixed model.Among 102 women and 42 men accelerometer measured SB or the elements of PA were not associated with circulating liver enzymes. When adjusted for age and sex, liver enzymes correlated positively with BMI and waist circumference (WC) (ALT r=0.34, p<0.0001, r=0.41, < 0.0001, AST r=0.17, p=0.049, r=0.26, p=0.002, GGT r=0.29, p=0.0005, r=0.32, p < 0.0001, respectively). SB proportion associated positively with BMI (r=0.21, p=0.008) and WC (r=0.27, p=0.001). Components of PA associated negatively with BMI (MVPA r=-0.23, p=0.005, daily steps r=-0.30, p<0.0001 and breaks in sedentary time r=-0.32, p<0.0001), as well as with WC (breaks in SB r=-0.35, p<0.0001, MVPA r=-0.26, p=0.002, daily steps r=-0.31, p<0.0001, standing time r=-0.27, p=0.001). Liver enzymes associated positively with common cardiometabolic markers such as resting heart rate (ALT; β=0.17, p=0.03, AST; β=0.25, p=0.002, GGT; β=0.23, p=0.004) and systolic/diastolic blood pressure (ALT β=0.20, p=0.01, β=0.22, p=0.005, AST (only diastolic) β=0.23, p=0.006, GGT β=0.19, p=0.02, = 0.23, p=0.004, respectively), fasting insulin (ALT β=0.41, p<0.0001, AST β=0.36, p=0.0003, GGT β=0.20, p=0.04) and insulin resistance index (ALT β=0.42, p<0.0001, AST β=0.36, p=0.0003, GGT β=0.21, p=0.03), even after adjustment with BMI.Liver enzymes correlate with body adiposity and appear to cluster with other common cardiometabolic risk factors, even independently of body adiposity. SB and PA appear not to be essential in modulating the levels of circulating liver enzymes.","['adiposity', 'liver', 'liver enzymes', 'obesity', 'physical activity', 'sedentary behavior']"
"Acceptability of Tuberculosis Preventive Treatment Strategies Among Healthcare Workers Using an Online Survey - China, 2021.","In the absence of effective vaccines, tuberculosis preventive treatment (TPT) is essential for the rapid decrease in incidences of tuberculosis (TB), and healthcare workers' acceptability is vital to implementing TPT.Overall, 86.5% of healthcare workers knew what TPT was. Most (56.3%) healthcare workers agreed to implement TPT among high-risk groups with latent tuberculosis infection. Drug resistance, adverse events, and unguaranteed efficacy were three main barriers for healthcare workers in accepting TPT.To further promote and implement TPT in China, practical measures included policy support, high-quality training for healthcare workers, and enhanced public awareness of TB prevention and control.","['Acceptability', 'Preventive Treatment Strategy', 'Tuberculosis']"
The Efficacy of Leviteracetam versus Carbamazepine for Epilepsy: A Meta-Analysis.,"Leviteracetam (LEV) is a novel antiepileptic drug with improved tolerance and safety, while carbamazepine (CBZ) represents classical antiepileptic drugs. So far, a systemic comparison of the efficacy and side effects of these two drugs is lacking. A literature review on the comparison of leviteracetam versus carbamazepine for patients with epilepsy was performed up to September 2013 using PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and ISI web of science. Finally, 3 randomized controlled trials (RCT) studies met the criteria on comparing the efficacy of leviteracetam versus carbamazepine for patients with epilepsy were included for meta-analysis. Stata 11.0 was used to analyze and summarize the respective data. Three RCTs met the entry criteria. The relative risk (RR) and 95% and the confidence interval (CI) of leviteracetam versus carbamazepine for 6- and 12-month seizure free intervals were 1.0 (0.91-1.10) and 0.97 (0.84-1.13), respectively, for therapy discontinuation due to adverse events (AEs) were 0.62 (0.48-0.80) and 1.00 (0.94-2.05), respectively, and for withdrawal after 6- and 12-month treatment were 0.8 (0.64-0.99) and 0.87 (0.74-1.03), respectively. The RR and 95% CI for occurrence of headache, fatigue, diarrhea, vertigo, nasopharyngitis, depression, weight gain and rash were 0.88 (0.73-1.06), 1.08(0.63-1.83), 1.23 (0.66-2.28), 0.92 (0.49-1.71), 0.85 (0.59-1.22), 2.15 (1.26-3.68), 0.69 (0.45-1.04), 0.39 (0.23-0.68), respectively. The major outcomes such as rate of seizure freedom were similar between leviteracetam and carbamazepine. However, leviteracetam led to depression more frequently than carbamazepine, while carbamazepine caused rash more frequently. However, the limited numbers of available RCTs studies and included patients in this study made our results less convincing and accurate.","['Carbamazepine', 'Efficacy', 'Epilepsy', 'Leviteracetam', 'Metaanalysis']"
Relationships Between Anthropometry and Maximal Strength in Male Classic Powerlifters.,"Several studies have determined the influence of physical characteristics on strength. The present quantified the relationships between anthropometry and maximal strength. Male classic powerlifters (n=59) were measured before a championship. Two-tailed Pearson correlation analysis was used. Powerlifters that presented higher relative maximal strength (RMS) in the squat and bench generally had higher body weight (BW), body mass index (BMI), torso circumference (C), waist C/height, torso C/height (r=0.26 to 0.49, p<0.05), and smaller lower leg length (L)/height and forearm L/torso C (r=-0.31 to -0.45, p<0.05) ratios. Powerlifters with a higher % of their deadlift on their total generally presented a smaller BW, BMI, body fat percentage (BF%), waist and torso C, trunk L, waist C/height, torso C/height, trunk L/height, waist C/hip C, thigh L/lower leg L, trunk L/thigh L ratios (r=-0.26 to -0.49, p<0.05) and higher lower leg L, lower leg L/height, reach/height, and forearm L/torso C ratios (r=0.32 to 0.51, p<0.05). Stepwise regressions revealed that a bigger torso positively predicted absolute maximal strength (AMS) in the squat (β=0.41, p=0.04), the bench (β=0.77, p<0.01), the deadlift (β=0.88, p<0.01) and the total (β=0.89, p<0.01), that a higher torso C/height ratio positively predicted RMS in the squat(β=0.48, p<0.01), the bench (β=-0.87, p<0.01) and the total (β=0.66, p<0.01), and that reach/height positively predicted RMS in the deadlift (β=0.37, p<0.01) and it's % on the total (β=0.31, p<0.01), but negatively predicted RMS in the bench (β=-0.25, p=0.02) and its % on the total (β=-0.24, p=0.04) As all of the stronger correlations came from AMS, powerlifters should focus on increasing AMS (weight lifted) instead of RMS (Wilks pts).","['Back squat', 'bench press', 'conventional deadlift', 'raw powerlifting', 'sumo deadlift']"
External validation of four nephrometry scores for trans-peritoneal robotic partial nephrectomy.,"External validation of four nephrometry scores (NS): Centrality index (C-index), arterial based complexity (ABC), preoperative aspects and dimensions used for an anatomical (PADUA) and radius expohytic/endophytic nearness anterior/posterior location (RENAL) scoring systems in patients who have undergone trans-peritoneal robotic assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN).A prospective database for RAPN has been maintained. Individual NSs were performed on 3-dimensional reconstructions of MDCT/MRI studies retrospectively by a board certified uroradiologist. Univariate Cox Proportional-Hazard Regression Analysis was performed for each NSs to valuate its predictability for the following parameters: Warm Ischemia Time (WIT), Estimated Blood Loss (EBL), Operative Time (OT), Complication Rates and Positive Margin Rates.78 RAPNs were performed for suspected renal malignancies. The mean OT, EBL and WIT time was 186.5 minutes (SD - 33.8), 125.5 mls (SD - 188.91) and 16.7 minutes (SD - 5.6) respectively. The overall complication rate was 20.5% (16/78) of which only 2.6% (2/78) were Clavien Grade 3 or higher complications. The mean change in creatinine change at Day - 1 was 12.54 μmol/L (SD - 18.05). On the Cox regression analysis only the Centrality index predicted prolonged WIT with statistical significance: C-Index (0.02), ABC (0.2), PADUA (0.2), RENAL (0.9). ABC predicted operative time with statistical significance: C-index (0.45), ABC (0.0004), PADUA (0.25), RENAL (0.3). None of the NSs could predict overall complication: C-index (0.5), ABC (0.2), PADUA (0.13), RENAL (0.5). None of the NSs predicted EBL: C-index (0.3)0, ABC (0.8), PADUA (0.2), RENAL (0.7). None of the NSs predicted Positive Margin Rates: C-index (0.4), ABC (0.4), PADUA (0.9), RENAL (0.8).C-index was able to predict prolonged WIT. ABC was a strong predictor of OT. PADUA and RENAL were poor predictors for all measured parameters.","['ABC', 'PADUA', 'centrality index', 'nephrometry scores', 'renal', 'robotic assisted partial nephrectomy']"
Do payers value rarity? An analysis of the relationship between disease rarity and orphan drug prices in Europe.,"<b>Background and Objective</b>: Orphan drugs have been a highlight of discussions due to their higher prices than non-orphan drugs. There is currently no European consensus on the method of value assessment for orphan drugs. This study assessed the relationship between the prevalence of rare diseases and the annual treatment cost of orphan drugs in France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden, and UK. <b>Methods</b>: Approved orphan drugs and prevalence data were extracted from the European Medicines Agency website. Annual treatment costs were calculated using ex-factory price. Simple regression was used to analyse the relationship between costs and prevalence. A specific bivariate analysis was performed for the rarest diseases (≤1 per 10,000). <b>Results</b>: 120 drugs were analysed. Prevalence ranged from 0.001 to 5 per 10,000 (mean 1.24, median 1). Annual treatment costs per patient ranged from €755 to €1,051,956 (mean €100,000, median €39,303). Results show a statistically significant inverse correlation between annual treatment cost and disease prevalence in all countries (France: r = -0.370, <i>p </i>= 0.002; Germany: r = -0.365, <i>p </i>= 0.002; Italy: r = -0.340, <i>p </i>= 0.002; Spain: r = -0.316, <i>p </i>= 0.041; UK: r = -0.358, <i>p </i>= 0.0004; Sweden: r = -0.414, <i>p </i>= 0.014; Norway: r = -0.367, <i>p </i>= 0.002). When analysis was focused on the rarest diseases, a stronger correlation exists in all countries (France: r = -0.525, Germany: r = -0.482, Italy: r = -0.497, Spain: r = -0.531, UK: r = -0.436, Sweden: r = -0.455, Norway: r = -0.466; all <i>p </i>< 0.05 except Sweden <i>p </i>= 0.077). <b>Conclusions</b>: This study shows an inverse correlation between annual treatment cost and prevalence with high statistical significance in the studied countries. Although pricing is a complex process where different attributes are assessed, this study supports the idea that payers value rarity in pricing decisions.","['Europe', 'Rare diseases', 'orphan drugs', 'pricing', 'treatment cost']"
Effects of different exercise types on visceral fat in young individuals with obesity aged 6-24 years old: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"<b>Introduction:</b> The prevalence of pediatric obesity remains high all over the world. Various exercise interventions have been applied to decrease the visceral fat in young individuals with obesity. But the evidence remains controversial on the effect of the exercise on visceral fat. Moreover, it is unclear which type of the exercise is the most effective for young individuals with overweight or obesity to reduce visceral fat. <b>Objective:</b> The objective of this review and meta-analysis is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different exercise interventions on visceral fat in young individuals with overweight or obesity. <b>Methods:</b> Four databases consisting of PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library were searched prior to May 2022. Fifteen studies with a total of 30 data points involving 1,134 participants were included in this meta-analysis. And the interventions were limited to 4 exercise types [i.e., aerobic exercise (AE), resistance exercise (RE), aerobic exercise combined with resistance exercise (CE), and high-intensity interval training (HIIT)]. <b>Data Synthesis:</b> The results showed that AE (Standardized Mean Difference = -0.32; 95% CI = -0.50 to -0.13; <i>p</i> = 0.0007; I<sup>2</sup> = 37%) and HIIT (SMD = -0.59; 95% CI = -0.87 to -0.31; <i>p</i> < 0.0001; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) had a significant reduction effect on visceral fat. And the effect of HIIT seemed better than AE. However, RE (SMD = -0.58; 95% CI = -1.34 to 0.17; <i>p</i> = 0.13; I<sup>2</sup> = 76%) and CE (SMD = -0.21; 95% CI = -0.81 to 0.38; <i>p</i> = 0.48; I<sup>2</sup> = 63%) had a non-significant effect on visceral fat decline. Additionally, compared with the control group, exercise interventions had a significant effect on reducing visceral fat in adolescents (SMD = -0.54; 95% CI = -0.82 to -0.26; <i>p</i> = 0.0001; I<sup>2</sup> = 64%) and young adults (SMD = -0.42; 95% CI = -0.69 to -0.15; <i>p</i> = 0.003; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) rather than children (SMD = -0.15; 95% CI = -0.32 to 0.02; <i>p</i> = 0.08; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). And the gender-based subgroup analysis indicated that the effectiveness of the exercise on the reduction of visceral fat was more significant in males (SMD = -1.27; 95% CI = -1.67 to -0.87; <i>p</i> < 0.00001; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) than that in females (SMD = -0.31; 95% CI = -0.48 to -0.14; <i>p</i> = 0.0004; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). <b>Conclusion:</b> This review and meta-analysis demonstrates that exercise interventions are efficient to decrease visceral fat in adolescents (12-18 years old) and young adults (18-24 years old). Among different exercise types, AE and HIIT are helpful for young individuals with overweight or obesity to reduce visceral fat and HIIT appears to be the most effective exercise intervention. In addition, the effect of exercise interventions on the consumption of visceral fat is more significant in males than that in females. <b>Systematic Review Registration:</b> [http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO], identifier [CRD42022310878].","['adolescents', 'exercise', 'metaanalysis', 'obesity', 'overweight', 'visceral fat VFA', 'young individuals']"
Effect of Epidemic Intermittent Fasting on Cardiometabolic Risk Factors: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Intermittent fasting (IF) has gained attention as a promising diet for weight loss and dysmetabolic diseases management. This systematic review aimed to investigate the effects of IF on cardiometabolic risk factors (CMRFs). A systematic literature search was carried out using three electronic databases, namely PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, until October 2020. Randomized controlled trials that compared the IF intervention with a control group diet were included. Fourteen effect sizes were expressed as weighted mean difference (WMD) using a fixed-effects model and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Compared to the ones within control groups, participants exposed to the IF intervention reduced their body weight (WMD, -1.78 kg; 95% CI, -2.21 to -1.35; <i>p</i> <0.05), waist circumference (WMD, -1.19 cm; 95% CI, -1.8 to -0.57; <i>p</i> <0.05), fat mass (WMD, -1.26 kg; 95% CI, -1.57 to -0.95; <i>p</i> <0.05), body mass index (WMD, -0.58 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 95% CI, -0.8 to -0.37; <i>p</i> <0.05), systolic blood pressure (WMD, -2.14 mmHg; 95% CI: -3.54 to -0.73; <i>p</i> <0.05), diastolic blood pressure (WMD: -1.38 mmHg, 95% CI, -2.35 to -0.41, <i>p</i> <0.05), fasting blood glucose (WMD: -0.053 mmol/L; 95% CI: -0.105 to 0.001; <i>p</i> <0.05), fasting insulin (WMD, -0.8 mIU/L; 95% CI, -1.15 to -0.44; <i>p</i> <0.05), insulin resistance (WMD, -0.21; 95% CI, -0.36 to -0.05; <i>p</i> <0.05), total cholesterol (WMD, -0.10 mmol/L; 95% CI, -0.17 to -0.02; <i>p</i> <0.05), and triglycerides (WMD, -0.09 mmol/L; 95% CI, -0.13 to -0.04; <i>p</i> <0.05). No effects were observed for low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or glycosylated hemoglobin. This meta-analysis supports the role of IF in improving the component composition of CMRFs, including weight, waist circumference, fat mass, BMI, blood pressure, total cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting insulin, and insulin resistance, compared to a control group diet.

Correlations between Antioxidant and Biochemical Parameters of Blood Serum of Duroc Breed Pigs.,"Correlations between the major biochemical (BC) and antioxidant (TAWSA) parameters of pigs' blood are necessary to study in order to assess physiological-biochemical status (PhBS), animal health, production, etc. Blood samples were obtained from Duroc breed boars (<i>n</i> = 77), divided into groups 1 (<i>n</i> = 25), 2 (<i>n</i> = 40) and 3 (<i>n</i> = 12), which were fattened for 65, 72 and 100 days, respectively. Significant positive and negative correlations were found between TAWSA and BC parameters of pigs' blood for group 3: very high in the case of total protein (TP) (-0.75) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (-0.79); high in the case of cholesterol (-0.72), glucose (0.66), alkaline phosphatase (0.66), calcium ions (-0.60) and globulins (0.53); moderate in the case of albumins (-0.36), triglycerides (-0.35), magnesium (-0.32) and phosphorus (-0.27). The same was found for group 2: high in the case of TP (0.51); moderate in the case of globulins (0.48), cholesterol (0.33) and phosphates (0.25). The only moderate correlation was found for group 1: magnesium (-0.48), glucose (0.36) and calcium (-0.25). This tendency indicated the stabilization of pig PhBS during growth and fattening, which can be useful for understanding the PhBS and antioxidant features of pigs, the factors of their nutrition, maintenance, etc.","['Duroc breed boars', 'antioxidants', 'biochemistry', 'blood parameters', 'correlation coefficients', 'feeding time']"
Controlled attenuation parameter for assessment of hepatic steatosis grades: a diagnostic meta-analysis.,"to evaluate the performance and accuracy of Controlled attenuation parameter CAP for hepatic steatosis detection.PubMed, EBSCO, Elsevier Science, Ovid, and Wiley were selected to search studies until August 31, 2014. Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies checklist was used to assess the quality of included studies. Heterogeneity was evaluated using Q test. Sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and the area under curve (AUC) with its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to evaluate the accuracy of CAP for assessment of hepatic steatosis stage (≥ S1, ≥ S2 and ≥ S3).Totally 11 studies (13 cohorts) with high methodological qualities were identified. The summary point estimations with 95% CIs of sensitivity, specificity, AUC and DORs were 0.78 (0.71, 0.84), 0.79 (0.70, 0.86), 0.86 (0.82, 0.88), and 14 (7, 27) for ≥ S1; 0.82 (0.74, 0.88), 0.79 (0.73, 0.85), 0.88 (0.85, 0.90) and 18 (10, 30) for ≥ S2; 0.86 (0.82, 0.89), 0.89 (0.86, 0.92), 0.94 (0.91, 0.96) and 51 (35, 76) for ≥ S3. Significant heterogeneity was found among the studies in ≥ S1 and ≥ S3. Threshold effect was existed in ≥ S3, but not in ≥ S1 and ≥ S2. Publication bias was not existed in ≥ S1 and ≥ S2 except ≥ S3.CAP provides good sensitivity and specificity for detection of ≥ S1, ≥ S2, and ≥ S3 steatosis. However, future studies with large samples are still necessary to confirm the clinical application.","['Controlled attenuation parameter', 'diagnostic metaanalysis', 'hepatic steatosis']"
"Carcass traits of young bulls in dual-purpose cattle: genetic parameters and genetic correlations with veal calf, type and production traits.","The profitability of dual-purpose breeding farms can be increased through genetic improvement of carcass traits. To develop a genetic evaluation of carcass traits of young bulls, breed-specific genetic parameters were estimated in three French dual-purpose breeds. Genetic correlations between these traits and veal calf, type and milk production traits were also estimated. Slaughter performances of 156 226 Montbeliarde, 160 361 Normande and 8691 Simmental young bulls were analyzed with a multitrait animal model. In the three breeds, heritabilities were moderate for carcass weight (0.12 to 0.19±0.01 to 0.04) and carcass conformation (0.21 to 0.26±0.01 to 0.04) and slightly lower for age at slaughter (0.08 to 0.17±0.01 to 0.03). For all three breeds, genetic correlations between carcass weight and carcass conformation were moderate and favorable (0.30 to 0.52±0.03 to 0.13). They were strong and favorable (-0.49 to -0.71±0.05 to 0.15) between carcass weight and age at slaughter. Between age at slaughter and carcass conformation, they were low and unfavorable to moderate and favorable (-0.25 to 0.10±0.06 to 0.18). Heavier young bulls tend to be better conformed and slaughtered earlier. Genetic correlations between corresponding young bulls and veal production traits were moderate and favorable (0.32 to 0.70±0.03 to 0.09), implying that selecting sires for veal calf production leads to select sires producing better young bulls. Genetic correlations between young bull carcass weight and cow size were moderately favorable (0.22 to 0.45±0.04 to 0.10). Young bull carcass conformation had moderate and favorable genetic correlations (0.11 to 0.24±0.04 to 0.10) with cow width but moderate and unfavorable genetic correlations (-0.21 to -0.36±0.03 to 0.08) with cow height. Taller cows tended to produce heavier young bulls and thinner cows to produce less conformed ones. Genetic correlations between carcass traits of young bulls and cow muscularity traits were low to moderate and favorable. Finally, genetic correlations between carcass traits of young bulls and milk production traits were low and unfavorable to moderate and favorable. These results indicate the existence for all three breeds of genetic variability for the genetic improvement of carcass traits of young bulls as well as favorable genetic correlations for their simultaneous selection and no strong unfavorable correlation with milk production traits.","['carcass traits', 'dualpurpose cattle', 'genetic correlations', 'heritability']"
Comparison of serum human epididymis protein 4 and carbohydrate antigen 125 as markers in ovarian cancer: A meta-analysis.,"Ovarian cancer (OC) is the third most common type of gynecological cancer. Measurements of human epididymis protein 4 (HE4) levels have been suggested for improving the specificity of the laboratory identification of OC. For this meta-analysis, the Medline, Embase and Cochrane databases were searched to identify relevant studies. All the included studies for diagnostic performance were combined with sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratios (DORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves and areas under the SROC curves (AUC). A total of 25 studies including 4,729 patients were identified as eligible for inclusion in the final analysis. The pooled sensitivities and respective 95% CIs for HE4 and carbohydrate antigen 125 (CA125) were 0.74 (0.72-0.76) and 0.74 (0.72-0.76), respectively. The pooled specificities and respective 95% CIs for HE4 and CA125 were 0.90 (0.89-0.91) and 0.83 (0.81-0.84), respectively. The summary DORs and 95% CIs for HE4 and CA125 were 43.35 (29.13-64.51) and 17.06 (10.97-26.51), respectively and the AUCs for HE4 and CA125 were 0.8915 and 0.8538, respectively. In total, 9 studies investigated the diagnostic accuracy of HE4 combined with CA125 for the diagnosis of OC. The pooled sensitivity and 95% CIs of HE4, CA125 and HE4+CA125 in this subgroup were 0.71 (0.67-0.75), 0.74 (0.69-0.78) and 0.90 (0.87-0.92), respectively; the pooled specificity and 95% CIs of HE4, CA125 and HE4+CA125 were 0.92 (0.90-0.94), 0.73 (0.69-0.76) and 0.85 (0.82-0.87), respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of HE4 in distinguishing OC from other benign gynecological diseases was found to be to be superior to that of CA125 and the combination of HE4 and CA125 may enhance the diagnostic sensitivity.","['carbohydrate antigen 125', 'human epididymis protein 4', 'metaanalysis', 'ovarian cancer']"
Oral diseases are associated with cognitive function in adults over 60 years old.,"To investigate the bidirectional association between oral diseases and cognitive function comprehensively.This cross sectional study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Oral diseases include periodontitis, dental caries, and tooth loss (end point of oral disease resulting in tooth extraction). Cognitive function included three domains: memory, processing speed, and executive function. A global cognitive score was then derived from sum of the three cognitive domains. Oral cognition associations were examined using various statistical models: (1) Regress oral disease on cognitive function; (2) Regress cognitive function on oral disease; and (3) Structural equation modelling treating cognition and oral disease as latent variables.There were 2508 participants aged 60+ who had both oral and cognitive information. Associations between various oral disease and global cognitive score were observed (Odds ratio OR<sub>cog->periodontitis</sub> 0.95, 95% Confidence Interval [0.92, 0.99]; β<sub>cog->caries</sub>  -0.13, [-0.23, -0.04]; β<sub>cog->tooth loss</sub>  -0.03 [-0.04, -0.01]; β<sub>tooth loss->cog</sub>  -0.04 [-0.06, -0.02]; β<sub>caries->cog</sub>  -0.03 [-0.06, -0.01]; β<sub>periodontitis->cog</sub>  -0.39 [-0.69, -0.10]). Significant correlation was also found between these oral disease and cognitive function using structural equation model (r -0.22, [-0.34, -0.10]).This study found robust bidirectional associations between oral disease and cognitive function using various modelling approaches among the aging population.","['aging', 'cognitive function', 'dental health', 'epidemiology', 'oral disease']"
WHO 2006 Child Growth Standards overestimate short stature and underestimate overweight in Japanese children.,"It is unclear whether the World Health Organization (WHO) 2006 Child Growth Standards are applicable to East Asian populations. We investigated the applicability of the WHO standards of length/height and weight to a cohort representing middle-class children in Japan.A cohort of children aged 0-5 years (3430 boys, 3025 girls) in the Tokyo Child Care Center Survey consecutively recruited from 2007 to 2013 were studied. Age- and sex-specific z-scores of length/height, weight and weight for length/height were calculated relative to either the WHO standards or the Japanese 2000 Growth References (nationally representative cross sectional survey data).Compared with the WHO standards, Japanese children at birth, 1, 3, 5 years were shorter (length/height standard deviation score [SDS] -0.26, -0.82, -0.81, -0.63 for boys, and -0.15, -0.67, -0.84, -0.62 for girls, respectively) and lighter (weight SDS -0.62, -0.36, -0.34, -0.42 for boys and -0.60, -0.17, -0.29, -0.43 for girls, respectively). Weight for length/height showed smaller differences at various length/height points (SDS -0.05 to 0.15 for boys, 0.01 to 0.29 for girls, respectively).Adoption of the WHO standards would substantially alter the prevalence of short stature, underweight and overweight in Japanese children 0-5 years of age. These findings advocate the use of the national references in Japan.","['Cohen’s criteria', 'East Asian populations', 'Japanese Growth Reference', 'Japanese children', 'WHO Growth Standards', 'infants and children']"
Genetic parameters for carcase measurements and age at slaughter in commercial cattle.,"Genetic parameters were estimated for cold carcase weight (CCW), carcase conformation (CON), carcase fat class (FAT), age at slaughter (AGE) and average daily carcase gain (ADCG) in 14 common UK breeds of cattle. These included crossbred animals but purebred datasets were also analysed for the most populous sire-breeds. Heritability estimates for beef breeds that were significant ranged from 0.24 to 0.44, 0.12 to 0.35, 0.12 to 0.36, 0.15 to 0.38 and 0.26 to 0.43 for CCW, CON, FAT, AGE and ADCG, respectively. For Holstein-Friesian, a dairy breed, heritability estimates were consistently lower than most beef breeds with estimates of 0.12, 0.13, 0.13, 0.06 and 0.15 for CCW, CON, FAT, AGE and ADCG, respectively. In all breed groups, genetic correlations were positive between CCW, CON and ADCG. In general, genetic correlations were moderate between CCW and CON (0.13 to 0.77), moderate to strong between CCW and ADCG (0.57 to 0.98) and weak or moderate between CON and ADCG (0.12 to 0.82). Genetic correlations for FAT with CCW (- 0.20 to - 0.42) and CON (- 0.16 to - 0.52) tended to be negative in the beef breed but were positive in the dairy breed, although not significant between CCW and FAT. For most beef breeds genetic correlations between AGE and carcase traits were not significant with the exceptions of AGE and CCW for Simmental (- 0.15) and Salers (- 0.24), AGE and CON for Limousin (0.15) and Simmental (0.14) and AGE and FAT from three sire-breeds (- 0.17 to - 0.35). However, the correlation between AGE and ADCG was negative and moderate to strong in magnitude (- 0.23 to - 0.67) in all beef breeds as expected since faster-growing animals reach slaughter age earlier. For Holstein-Friesian, all genetic correlations with AGE were negative and moderate to strong. Genetic correlations indicate that selection for increased carcase weight should simultaneously increase growth rate and improve conformation in all breeds and reduce carcase fatness in the majority of beef breeds. The results indicate that there is genetic variation in all five traits suitable for undertaking genetic improvement of carcase traits and age at slaughter; however, there are apparent breed differences. The use of abattoir-derived phenotypes for undertaking genetic improvement is an example where the supply chain can work together to share information to enable the cattle industry to move forward.","['Abattoir', 'Beef', 'Carcase', 'Dairy', 'Genetic parameters']"
Structural equation model for estimating risk factors in type 2 diabetes mellitus in a Middle Eastern setting: evidence from the STEPS Qatar.,"Understanding type 2 diabetes mellitus is critical for designing effective diabetes prevention policies in Qatar and the Middle East.Using the Qatar 2012 WHO STEPwise approach to surveillance survey, a subsample of 1224 Qatari participants aged 18-64 years was selected. Subjects had their fasting blood glucose levels tested, had not been diagnosed with or treated for diabetes, had a fasting time >12 hours and were not pregnant. We applied a hypothesized structural equation model (SEM) to assess sociodemographic, behavioral, anthropometric and metabolic variables affecting persons with type 2 diabetes mellitus.There is a direct effect of triglyceride levels (0.336) and body mass index (BMI) (0.164) on diabetes status. We also found that physical activity levels negatively affect BMI (-0.148) and positively affect high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (0.106); sociodemographic background negatively affects diet (-0.522) and BMI (-0.352); HDL positively affects total cholesterol (0.230) and has a negative effect on BMI (-0.108), triglycerides (-0.128) and waist circumference (-0.104). Diet has a positive effect on triglycerides (0.281) while family history of diabetes negatively affects total cholesterol (-0.104). BMI has a positive effect on waist circumference (0.788) and mediates the effects of physical activity over diabetes status (-0.028). BMI also mediates the effects that sociodemographic factors (-0.058) and physical activity (-0.024) have on diabetes status. BMI and HDL (-0.002) together mediate the effect of physical activity on diabetes status and similarly HDL and tryglycerides (-0.005) also mediate the effect of physical activity on diabetes status. Finally diet and tryglycerides mediate the effects that sociodemographic factors have on diabetes status (-0.049).This study's main finding is that triglyceride levels and BMI are the main variables directly affecting diabetes status in the Qatari population.","['Analytic Methods', 'BMI', 'Lipids and Diabetes', 'Triglycerides']"
"Effects of internal cooling on physical performance, physiological and perceptional parameters when exercising in the heat: A systematic review with meta-analyses.","<b>Background:</b> An elevated core temperature (<i>T</i>core) increases the risk of performance impairments and heat-related illness. Internal cooling (IC) has the potential to lower <i>T</i>core when exercising in the heat. The aim of the review was to systematically analyze the effects of IC on performance, physiological, and perceptional parameters. <b>Methods:</b> A systematic literature search was performed in the PubMed database on 17 December 2021. Intervention studies were included assessing the effects of IC on performance, physiological, or perceptional outcomes. Data extraction and quality assessment were conducted for the included literature. The standardized mean differences (SMD) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CI) were calculated using the inverse-variance method and a random-effects model. <b>Results:</b> 47 intervention studies involving 486 active subjects (13.7% female; mean age 20-42 years) were included in the meta-analysis. IC resulted in significant positive effects on time to exhaustion [SMD (95% CI) 0.40 (0.13; 0.67), <i>p</i> < 0.01]. IC significantly reduced <i>T</i>core [-0.19 (22120.34; -0.05), <i>p</i> < 0.05], sweat rate [-0.20 (-0.34; -0.06), <i>p</i> < 0.01], thermal sensation [-0.17 (-0.33; -0.01), <i>p</i> < 0.05], whereas no effects were found on skin temperature, blood lactate, and thermal comfort (<i>p</i> > 0.05). IC resulted in a <i>borderline</i> significant reduction in time trial performance [0.31 (-0.60; -0.02), <i>p</i> = 0.06], heart rate [-0.13 (-0.27; 0.01), <i>p</i> = 0.06], rate of perceived exertion [-0.16 (-0.31; -0.00), <i>p</i> = 0.05] and <i>borderline</i> increased mean power output [0.22 (0.00; 0.44), <i>p</i> = 0.05]. <b>Discussion:</b> IC has the potential to affect endurance performance and selected physiological and perceptional parameters positively.

Patients' and Clinicians' Perceptions of Clinician-Expressed Empathy in Advanced Cancer Consultations and Associations with Patient Outcomes.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Empathy is a cornerstone of effective communication. However, clinicians' and patients' perceptions of clinician-expressed empathy might differ. The independent perceptions of patients and clinicians on clinician-expressed empathy in advanced cancer consultations and the associations of these perceptions with patient outcomes are unknown. <b><i>Objective:</i></b> We assessed (1) patients' and clinicians' independent perceptions of clinician-(self-)expressed empathy in advanced cancer consultations and (2) the associations between these perceptions and affective patient outcomes. <b><i>Methods:</i></b> This observational study included data from 41 consultations in the advanced breast cancer setting. Postconsultation, patients' and clinicians' perceptions of clinician-expressed empathy were assessed, as well as patients' (1) pre-post anxiety, (2) post-anxiety, (3) emotional well-being, and (4) satisfaction. Multilevel regression analyses were run to draw conclusions. <b><i>Results:</i></b> Patients perceived higher levels of empathy than clinicians, without a significant relationship between the two (mean [<i>M</i>] = 85.47, standard deviation [SD] = 14.00 vs. <i>M</i> = 61.88, SD = 15.30, 0-100 scale; <i>β</i> = 0.14, <i>p</i> < 0.138, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.04 to 0.32). Higher patient-perceived empathy was associated with decreased anxiety [(1) <i>β</i> = -0.67, <i>p</i> = 0.039, 95% CI = -1.30 to -0.03; (2) <i>β</i> = -0.15, <i>p</i> = 0.042, 95% CI = -0.30 to -0.01], higher satisfaction (<i>β</i> = 0.05, <i>p</i> < 0.001, 95% CI = 0.03 to 0.08), and lower emotional distress (<i>β</i> = -0.32, <i>p</i> < 0.001, 95% CI = -0.48 to -0.16). There were no associations with clinicians' perceptions [(1) <i>β</i> = -0.34, <i>p</i> = 0.307, 95% CI = -1.00 to 0.31; (2) <i>β</i> = -0.02, <i>p</i> = 0.824, 95% CI = -0.17 to 0.14; (3) <i>β</i> < 0.01, <i>p</i> = 0.918, 95% CI = -0.03 to 0.02; (4) <i>β</i> = 0.08, <i>p</i> = 0.335, 95% CI = -0.08 to 0.25]. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Patients' and clinicians' empathy perceptions differed.

Comparison of the Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Asians and the fracture risk assessment tool - FRAX to identify densitometric defined osteoporosis: A discriminatory value analysis in a multi-ethnic female population in Southeast Asia.,"The accuracy of FRAX® as a screening tool to identify osteoporosis and how it compares with tools such as Osteoporosis Self-Assessment Tool for Asians (OSTA), in Southeast Asian women has so far been unexplored. We aimed to determine the FRAX® thresholds that accurately identify densitometric osteoporosis and to compare its performance with that of OSTA for this purpose.Singaporean postmenopausal women (n = 1056) were evaluated. FRAX® Major Osteoporotic Fracture Probability (MOFP), Hip Fracture Probability (HFP) scores, and OSTA indices were calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed and via the Youden index, the optimal cut-off points of balanced sensitivity and specificity for dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-defined osteoporosis were identified and the performance characteristics were compared.A FRAX® MOFP threshold of ≥3.7% had sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of 0.78 (0.73-0.83), 0.63 (0.59-0.66), 0.4 (0.36-0.44), and 0.9 (0.87-0.92), respectively in identifying osteoporosis. The corresponding values for a HFP threshold of ≥0.6% were 0.85 (0.80-0.89), 0.58 (0.55-0.62), 0.39 (0.35-0.43), and 0.92 (0.9-0.94) and that for an OSTA index cut-off of ≤ -1.2 were 0.76 (0.70-0.81), 0.74 (0.71-0.77), 0.48 (0.43-0.54), and 0.91 (0.88-0.93). The area under the ROC curves were 82.8% (79.9%-85.6%), 77.6% (74.2%-81%), and 79.6% (76.5%-82.8%) for OSTA, MOFP, and HFP thresholds respectively.FRAX® and OSTA perform comparably in identifying osteoporosis in our population. OSTA has only 2 parameters and may be simpler to use. However, FRAX® may also have a role in primary screening to identify the postmenopausal woman to be referred for DXA scanning and may help facilitate fracture risk reduction discussions with the patient.","['Asia', 'Assessment threshold', 'FRAX', 'OSTA', 'Osteoporosis', 'Screening']"
Statins significantly reduce mortality in patients receiving clopidogrel without affecting platelet activation and aggregation: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Combination of statins and clopidogrel is frequently administered in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD). They are mainly activated and eliminated in the liver by cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4 (CYP3A4). The aim was to clarify whether the coadministration of clopidogrel and statins attenuate respective efficacy.PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Clinical Trials. gov were searched for until August 2018. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and cohort studies were taken into quality evaluation. Data were pooled using random effect models to estimate standard mean difference (SMD) or risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI).In total, 28 studies representing 25,267 participants were included. Statins reduce the mortality of patients administered clopidogrel (RR 0.54; 95% CI 0.40,0.74; p = 0.000), no differences were found in platelet aggregation (PA) (SMD 0.02; 95% CI -0.38,0.42; p = 0.920) and the expressions of P-selectin (SMD -0.04; 95% CI -0.14,0.05; p = 0.346), CD40L (SMD 0.09; 95% CI -0.29,0.48; p = 0.633), CD63 (SMD 0.09; 95% CI -0.01,0.19; p = 0.079) and PAC-1 (SMD 0.03; 95% CI -0.08,0.13; p = 0.633). Furthermore, CYP3A4 metabolized or non-CYP3A4 metabolized statins have no discrepancies in PA (SMD 0.13; 95% CI -0.31,0.58; p = 0.556), P-selectin (SMD 0.17; 95% CI -0.16,0.51; p = 0310), death (RR 0.89; 95% CI 0.38,2.07; p = 0.791), except for triglyceride (TG) (SMD -0.19; 95% CI -0.33,-0.06; p = 0.005).This meta-analysis confirmed that statins reduce mortality in patients undergoing clopidogrel treatment without affecting platelet activation and aggregation.","['Clopidogrel', 'Lipid', 'Metaanalysis', 'Mortality', 'Platelet aggregation', 'Statins']"
Insulin Clearance at the Pubertal Transition in Youth with Obesity and Steatosis Liver Disease.,"No data are available on insulin clearance (Cl<sub>I</sub>) trends during the pubertal transition. The aim of this study was to investigate in 973 youths with obesity whether Cl<sub>I</sub> in fasting and post-oral glucose challenge (OGTT) conditions varies at the pubertal transition in relation to the severity of obesity and the presence of steatosis liver disease (SLD). The severity of obesity was graded according to the Centers for Disease Control. SLD was graded as absent, mild and severe based on alanine amino transferase levels. Cl<sub>I</sub> was defined as the molar ratio of fasting C-peptide to insulin and of the areas under the insulin to glucose curves during an OGTT. In total, 35% of participants were prepubertal, 72.6% had obesity class II, and 52.6% had mild SLD. Fasting Cl<sub>I</sub> (nmol/pmol × 10<sup>-2</sup>) was significantly lower in pubertal [0.11 (0.08-0.14)] than in prepubertal individuals [0.12 (0.09-0.16)] and higher in class III [0.15 (0.11-0.16)] than in class I obesity [0.11 (0.09-0.14)]. OGTT Cl<sub>I</sub> was higher in boys [0.08 (0.06-0.10)] than in girls [0.07 (0.06-0.09)]; in prepubertal [0.08 (0.06-0.11)] than in pubertal individuals [0.07 (0.05-0.09)]; in class III [0.14 (0.08-0.17)] than in class I obesity [0.07 (0.05-0.10)]; and in severe SLD [0.09 (0.04-0.14)] than in no steatosis [0.06 (0.04-0.17)]. It was lower in participants with prediabetes [0.06 (0.04-0.07)]. OGTT Cl<sub>I</sub> was lower in youths with obesity at puberty along with insulin sensitivity and greater secretion. The findings suggest that the initial increase in Cl<sub>I</sub> in youth with severe obesity and SLD is likely to compensate for hyperinsulinemia and its subsequent decrease at the onset of prediabetes and other metabolic abnormalities.","['fatty liver disease', 'insulin clearance', 'obesity', 'puberty']"
Perioperative cerebral blood flow measured by arterial spin labeling with different postlabeling delay in patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy: a comparison study with CT perfusion.,"Arterial spin labeling (ASL) is a non-invasive technique for measuring cerebral perfusion. Its accuracy is affected by the arterial transit time. This study aimed to (1) evaluate the accuracy of ASL in measuring the cerebral perfusion of patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and (2) determine a better postlabeling delay (PLD) for pre- and postoperative perfusion imaging between 1.5 and 2.0 s.A total of 24 patients scheduled for CEA due to severe carotid stenosis were included in this study. All patients underwent ASL with two PLDs (1.5 and 2.0 s) and computed tomography perfusion (CTP) before and after surgery. Cerebral blood flow (CBF) values were measured on the registered CBF images of ASL and CTP. The correlation in measuring perioperative relative CBF (rCBF) and difference ratio of CBF (DR<sub>CBF</sub>) between ASL with PLD of 1.5 s (ASL<sub>1.5</sub>) or 2.0 s (ASL<sub>2.0</sub>) and CTP were also determined.There were no significant statistical differences in preoperative rCBF measurements between ASL<sub>1.5</sub> and CTP (<i>p</i> = 0.17) and between ASL<sub>2.0</sub> and CTP (<i>p</i> = 0.42). Similarly, no significant differences were found in rCBF between ASL<sub>1.5</sub> and CTP (<i>p</i> = 0.59) and between ASL<sub>2.0</sub> and CTP (<i>p</i> = 0.93) after CEA. The DR<sub>CBF</sub> measured by CTP was found to be marginally lower than that measured by ASL<sub>2.0_1.5</sub> (<i>p</i> = 0.06) and significantly lower than that measured by ASL<sub>1.5_1.5</sub> (<i>p</i> = 0.01), ASL<sub>2.0_2.0</sub> (<i>p</i> = 0.03), and ASL1<sub>.5_2.0</sub> (<i>p</i> = 0.007). There was a strong correlation in measuring perioperative rCBF and DR<sub>CBF</sub> between ASL and CTP (r = 0.67-0.85, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Using CTP as the reference standard, smaller bias can be achieved in measuring rCBF by ASL<sub>2.0</sub> (-0.02) than ASL<sub>1.5</sub> (-0.07) before CEA. In addition, the same bias (0.03) was obtained by ASL<sub>2.0</sub> and ASL<sub>1.5</sub> after CEA. The bias of ASL<sub>2.0_2.0</sub> (0.31) and ASL<sub>2.0_1.5</sub> (0.32) on DR<sub>CBF</sub> measurement was similar, and both were smaller than that of ASL<sub>1.5_1.5</sub> (0.60) and ASL<sub>1.5_2.0</sub> (0.60).Strong correlation can be found in assessing perioperative cerebral perfusion between ASL and CTP. During perioperative ASL imaging, the PLD of 2.0 s is better than 1.5 s for preoperative scan, and both 1.5 and 2.0 s are suitable for postoperative scan.","['arterial spin labeling', 'carotid endarterectomy', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'multidetector computed tomography', 'perfusion']"
Effect of concurrent training on physical performance and quality of life in children with malignancy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This study aims to evaluate the intervention effect of concurrent training on children with malignant tumors to provide evidence for prescribing exercise for children with malignant tumors.Twelve databases were searched from inception to October 15, 2022. Two researchers independently screened the literature, evaluated the quality, extracted the data, and performed the meta-analysis using R.A total of nine randomized controlled trials involving 371 children were included in this study. The meta-analysis revealed that muscle strength was significantly greater in the exercise group compared to the usual care group [SMD = 0.26, 95% CI (0.04, 0.48), <i>P</i> = 0.023], with subgroup analysis showing no significant difference in upper limb [SMD = 0.13, 95% CI (-0.17, 0.43), <i>P</i> = 0.318] and a considerable difference in lower limb strength [SMD = 0.41, 95% CI (0.08, 0.74), <i>P</i> = 0.015]. Physical activity [SMD = 0.57, 95% CI (0.03, 1.1), <i>P</i> = 0.038], timed up and down stairs test [SMD = -1.22, 95% CI (-2.04, -0.4), <i>P</i> = 0.004], 6-min walking ability [SMD = 0.75, 95% CI (0.38, 1.11), <i>P</i> < 0.01], quality of life [SMD = 0.28, 95% CI (0.02, 0.53), <i>P</i> = 0.033], and cancer-related fatigue [SMD = -0.53, 95% CI (-0.86, -0.19), <i>P</i> = 0.002] were significantly better than the usual care group. There were no significant differences in peak oxygen uptake [SMD = 0.13, 95% CI (-0.18, 0.44), <i>P</i> = 0.397], depression [SMD = 0.06, 95% CI (-0.38, 0.5), <i>P</i> = 0.791], and withdrawal rates [RR = 0.59, 95% CI (0.21, 1.63), <i>P</i> = 0.308] between the two groups.Concurrent training could improve physical performance for children with malignancy but had no significant effect on mental health. Because the quality level of evidence is mostly very low, future high-quality randomized controlled trials are required to confirm these findings.https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=364140, identifier CRD42022308176.","['concurrent training', 'exercises physicalskill', 'pediatric', 'physical performance', 'quality of life']"
A novel rapid measurement method of cervical sagittal parameters based on the integrated inclinometer of a smartphone: a validity and reliability study.,"<b>Objectives:</b> A new method was introduced using a smartphone's integrated inclinometer for rapid measurement of sagittal cervical parameters. The present study aims to compare the validity and reliability of the proposed method.<b>Methods:</b> We retrospectively reviewed 120 patients with cervical spondylosis treated at our hospital. The C0-2 Cobb angle, C2-7 Cobb angle, T1-slope (T1S), and neck tilt (NT) were selected as representative sagittal angles for this study. Two methods, the smartphone's integrated inclinometer and picture archiving and communication system (PACS), were used to measure these four representative angles. Validity, reliability, and measurement times were recorded and compared.<b>Results:</b> The representative parameters (C0-2 Cobb angle, C2-7 Cobb angle, T1S, and NT), the ICC was 0.957 (0.939-0.970), 0.971 (0.958-0.979), 0.974 (0.963-0.982) and 0.949 (0.927-0.964) for validity respectively. For the aforementioned representative parameters, the ICC values were 0.972 (0.960-0.980), 0.979 (0.969-0.985), 0.972 (0.959-0.980), 0.942 (0.917-0.959) for intraobserver reliability respectively. For the representative parameters mentioned above, the ICC values were 0.947 (0.926-0.963), 0.964 (0.949-0.975), 0.956 (0.938-0.969), 0.916 (0.881-0.940) for interobserver reliability respectively. For the validity of the representative parameters mentioned above, the Bland-Altman plot displayed a mean difference of 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, and 0.4°with a 95% CI of 4.3, 4.5, 3.4, and 4.1°, respectively. The measurement by smartphone's integrated inclinometer (46.31 ± 3.99 s) was significantly quicker than that by PACS (69.48 ± 3.25 s) according to independent-samples T test (<i>p</i> < 0.001).<b>Conclusion:</b> This novel smartphone measurement based on the integrated inclinometer is accurate and reliable for measuring cervical sagittal parameters rapidly and conveniently.","['NT', 'Smartphone', 'T1S', 'cobb angle', 'measurement']"
A bayesian approach to model the underlying predictors of early recurrence and postoperative death in patients with colorectal Cancer.,"This study aimed at utilizing a Bayesian approach semi-competing risks technique to model the underlying predictors of early recurrence and postoperative Death in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).In this prospective cohort study, 284 patients with colorectal cancer, who underwent surgery, referred to Imam Khomeini clinic in Hamadan from 2001 to 2017. The primary outcomes were the probability of recurrence, the probability of Mortality without recurrence, and the probability of Mortality after recurrence. The patients 'recurrence status was determined from patients' records. The Bayesian survival modeling was carried out by semi-competing risks illness-death models, with accelerated failure time (AFT) approach, in R 4.1 software. The best model was chosen according to the lowest deviance information criterion (DIC) and highest logarithm of the pseudo marginal likelihood (LPML).The log-normal model (DIC = 1633, LPML = -811), was the optimal model. The results showed that gender(Time Ratio = 0.764: 95% Confidence Interval = 0.456-0.855), age at diagnosis (0.764: 0.538-0.935 ), T<sub>3</sub> stage (0601: 0.530-0.713), N<sub>2</sub> stage (0.714: 0.577-0.935 ), tumor size (0.709: 0.610-0.929), grade of differentiation at poor (0.856: 0.733-0.988), and moderate (0.648: 0.503-0.955) levels, and the number of chemotherapies (1.583: 1.367-1.863) were significantly related to recurrence. Also, age at diagnosis (0.396: 0.313-0.532), metastasis to other sites (0.566: 0.490-0.835), T<sub>3</sub> stage (0.363: 0.592 - 0.301), T<sub>4</sub> stage (0.434: 0.347-0.545), grade of differentiation at moderate level (0.527: 0.387-0.674), tumor size (0.595: 0.500-0.679), and the number of chemotherapies (1.541: 1.332-2.243) were the significantly predicted the death. Also, age at diagnosis (0.659: 0.559-0.803), and the number of chemotherapies (2.029: 1.792-2.191) were significantly related to mortality after recurrence.According to specific results obtained from the optimal Bayesian log-normal model for terminal and non-terminal events, appropriate screening strategies and the earlier detection of CRC leads to substantial improvements in the survival of patients.","['Bayesian', 'Colorectal cancer', 'Early recurrence', 'Mortality', 'Semicompeting risks']"
Detection Methods for Early Caries Diagnosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The aim was to appraise the evidence on the performance of various means for the detection of incipient caries in vivo. Five databases of published and unpublished research were searched for studies from January 2000 to October 2019. Search terms included ""early caries"" and ""caries detection."" Inclusion criteria involved diagnostic test accuracy studies for early caries detection in permanent and primary teeth. A risk-of-bias assessment was performed using the QUADAS-2 tool. We performed the study selection, data extraction, and risk-of-bias assessment in duplicate. The review protocol was a priori registered in the Open Science Framework. Of the initially 22,964 search results, 51 articles were included. For permanent teeth, when histologic examination was considered as the reference for occlusal surfaces, the sensitivity (Se) range appeared high for the DIAGNOdent Pen (DD Pen) at 0.81-0.89, followed by ICDAS-II at 0.62-1, DIAGNOdent (DD) at 0.48-1, and bitewing radiography (BW) at 0-0.29. The corresponding specificity (Sp) range was: DD Pen 0.71-0.8, ICDAS-II 0.5-0.84, DD 0.54-1, and BW 0.96-1. When operative intervention served as the reference for occlusal surfaces, again, the DD means valued the most promising results on Se: DD 0.7-0.96 and DD Pen 0.55-0.90, followed by ICDAS-II 0.25-0.93, and BW 0-0.83. The Sp range was: DD 0.54-1, DD Pen 0.71-1, ICDAS-II 0.44-1, and BW 0.6-1. For approximal surfaces, the Se was: BW 0.75-0.83, DD Pen 0.6, and ICDAS-II 0.54; the Sp was: BW 0.6-0.9, DD Pen 0.2, and ICDAS-II 1. For primary teeth, under the reference of histologic assessment, the Se range for occlusal surfaces was: DD 0.55-1, DD Pen 0.63-1, ICDAS-II 0.42-1, and BW 0.31-0.96; the respective Sp was: DD 0.5-1, DD Pen 0.44-1, ICDAS-II 0.61-1, and BW 0.79-0.98. For approximal surfaces, the Se range was: DD Pen 0.58-0.63, ICDAS-II 0.42-0.55, and BW 0.14-0.71. The corresponding Sp range was: DD Pen 0.85-0.87, ICDAS-II 0.73-0.93, and BW 0.79-0.98. Se and Sp values varied, due to the heterogeneity regarding the setting of individual studies. Evidently, robust conclusions cannot be drawn, and different diagnostic means should be used as adjuncts to clinical examination. In permanent teeth, visual examination may be enhanced by DD on occlusal surfaces and BW on approximal surfaces. In primary teeth, DD Pen may serve as a supplementary tool across all surfaces.","['Caries detection', 'Early caries', 'Incipient caries', 'Permanent teeth', 'Primary teeth']"
Impact of PCSK9 monoclonal antibodies on circulating hs-CRP levels: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,"To evaluate the potential effects of proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 monoclonal antibody (PCSK9-mAb) on high-sensitivity C reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentrations.A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.PubMed, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Library databases, ClinicalTrials.gov and recent conferences were searched from inception to May 2018.All randomised controlled trials that reported changes of hs-CRP were included.Ten studies involving 4198 participants were identified. PCSK9-mAbs showed a slight efficacy in reducing hs-CRP (-0.04 mg/L, 95% CI: -0.17 to 0.01) which was not statistically different. The results did not altered when subgroup analyses were performed including PCSK9-mAb types (alirocumab: 0.12 mg/L, 95% CI: -0.18 to 0.43; evolocumab: 0.00 mg/L, 95% CI: -0.07 to 0.07; LY3015014: -0.48 mg/L, 95% CI: -1.28 to 0.32; RG7652: 0.35 mg/L, 95% CI: -0.26 to 0.96), treatment duration (≤12w: 0.00 mg/L, 95% CI: -0.07 to 0.07; >12w: -0.11 mg/L, 95% CI: -0.45 to -0.23), participant characteristics (familial hypercholesterolaemia: 0.00 mg/L, 95% CI: -0.07 to 0.07; non-familial hypercholesterolaemia: 0.07 mg/L, 95% CI: -0.12 to 0.26; mix: -0.48 mg/L, 95% CI: -1.28 to 0.32) and treatment methods (monotherapy: 0.00 mg/L, -0.08 to 0.07; combination therapy: -0.08 mg/L, -0.37 to 0.21). Meta-regression analyses suggested no significant linear correlation between baseline age (p=0.673), sex (p=0.645) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol reduction (p=0.339).Our updated meta-analysis suggested that PCSK9-mAbs had no significant impact on circulating hs-CRP levels irrespective of PCSK9-mAb types, participant characteristics and treatment duration or methods.","['PCSk9', 'hsCRP', 'metaanalysis', 'monoclonal antibody']"
Gut dysbiosis in rheumatic diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis of 92 observational studies.,"Emerging evidence suggests that dysbiosis in gut microbiota may contribute to the occurrence or development of several rheumatic diseases. Since gut microbiota dysbiosis is potentially modifiable, it has been postulated to be a promising preventive or therapeutic target for rheumatic diseases. However, the current understanding on the potential associations between gut microbiota and rheumatic diseases is still inadequate. Therefore, we aimed to synthesise the accumulating evidence for the relation of gut microbiota to rheumatic diseases.The PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched from inception to March 11, 2022 to include observational studies evaluating the associations between gut microbiota and rheumatic diseases. Standardised mean difference (SMD) of α-diversity indices between rheumatic diseases and controls were estimated using random-effects model. β-diversity indices and relative abundance of gut microbes were summarised qualitatively.Of the included 92 studies (11,998 participants), 68 provided data for α-diversity. Taken together as a whole, decreases in α-diversity indices were consistently found in rheumatic diseases (observed species: SMD = -0.36, [95%CI = -0.63, -0.09]; Chao1: SMD = -0.57, [95%CI = -0.88, -0.26]; Shannon index: SMD = -0.33, [95%CI = -0.48, -0.17]; Simpson index: SMD = -0.32, [95%CI = -0.49, -0.14]). However, when specific rheumatic diseases were examined, decreases were only observed in rheumatoid arthritis (observed species: SMD = -0.51, [95%CI = -0.78, -0.24]; Shannon index: SMD = -0.31, [95%CI = -0.49, -0.13]; Simpson index: SMD = -0.31, [95%CI = -0.54, -0.08]), systemic lupus erythematosus (Chao1: SMD = -1.60, [95%CI = -2.54, -0.66]; Shannon index: SMD = -0.63, [95%CI = -1.08, -0.18]), gout (Simpson index: SMD = -0.64, [95%CI = -1.07, -0.22]) and fibromyalgia (Simpson index: SMD = -0.28, [95%CI = -0.44, -0.11]), whereas an increase was observed in systemic sclerosis (Shannon index: SMD = 1.25, [95%CI = 0.09, 2.41]). Differences with statistical significance in β-diversity were consistently reported in ankylosing spondylitis and IgG4-related diseases. Although little evidence of disease specificity of gut microbes was found, shared alterations of the depletion of anti-inflammatory butyrate-producing microbe (i.e., Faecalibacterium) and the enrichment of pro-inflammatory microbe (i.e., Streptococcus) were observed in rheumatoid arthritis, Sjögren's syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus.Gut microbiota dysbiosis was associated with rheumatic diseases, principally with potentially non-specific, shared alterations of microbes.National Natural Science Foundation of China (81930071, 81902265, 82072502 and U21A20352).","['Gut dysbiosis', 'Gut microbiota', 'Metaanalysis', 'Rheumatic diseases']"
Fractionation of unreduced gluten proteins on SEC and their relationship with cookie quality characteristics.,"The size distribution assessment of unreduced wheat gluten proteins of commercial Indian wheat varieties was examined using Size-Exclusion Fast Protein Liquid Chromatography. Elution profiles were fractionated into five peaks, with the molecular weights of eluting peaks as 130-30, 55-20, 28-10 and <10 kDa (IV and V), respectively. Peak I (glutenins) and II (gliadins) exhibited contrary results with AWRC (r = 0.928** and r = -0.831**), R/E ratio (r = 0.745** and r = -0.869**), gluten index (r = 0.959** and r = -0.994**), gliadin/glutenin ratio (r = -0.952** and r = 0.948**), dough development time (r = 0.830** and r = -0.930**), dough stability (r = 0.901** and r = -0.979**) and dough weakening (r = -0.969** and r = 0.986**). Significant statistical correlation was also observed for peak I and II with cookie hardness (r = 0.948** and r = -0.924**) and cookie spread (r = -0.837** and r = -0.743**) respectively. Peak III, IV and V occupied a minor fraction of whole and did not exhibit a statistically significant correlation with any of the quality parameters.","['Cookie quality', 'Dough rheology', 'Gliadin', 'Glutenin', 'SEC']"
"Negative Effects of Mental Fatigue on Performance in the Yo-Yo Test, Loughborough Soccer Passing and Shooting Tests: A Meta-Analysis.","We aimed to examine the effects of mental fatigue on the Yo-Yo test and Loughborough soccer passing and shooting tests performance using a meta-analysis. The search for studies was performed through eight bibliographic databases (Academic Search Elite, AUSPORT, Cochrane Library, PsycInfo, PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science). The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the PEDro checklist. A random-effects meta-analysis was performed for data analysis. After reviewing 599 search results, seven studies with a total of ten groups were included in the review. All studies were classified as being of good methodological quality. Mental fatigue reduced the distance covered in the Yo-Yo test (Cohen's <i>d</i>: -0.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.66, -0.32). In the Loughborough soccer passing test, mental fatigue increased the original time needed to complete the test (Cohen's <i>d</i>: -0.24; 95% CI: -0.46, -0.03), increased penalty time (Cohen's <i>d</i>: -0.39; 95% CI: -0.46, -0.31), and decreased performance time (Cohen's <i>d</i>: -0.52; 95% CI: -0.80, -0.24). In the Loughborough soccer shooting test, mental fatigue decreased points per shot (Cohen's <i>d</i>: -0.37; 95% CI: -0.70, -0.04) and shot speed (Cohen's <i>d</i>: -0.35; 95% CI: -0.64, -0.06). Overall, the findings presented in this review demonstrated that mental fatigue negatively impacts endurance-based running performance as well as soccer passing and shooting skills.","['cognitive task', 'data synthesis', 'mental fatigue', 'performance', 'soccer', 'teamsport']"
Physical determinants of interval sprint times in youth soccer players.,"Relationships between sprinting speed, body mass, and vertical jump kinetics were assessed in 243 male soccer athletes ranging from 10-19 years. Participants ran a maximal 36.6 meter sprint; times at 9.1 (10 y) and 36.6 m (40 y) were determined using an electronic timing system. Body mass was measured by means of an electronic scale and body composition using a 3-site skinfold measurement completed by a skilled technician. Countermovement vertical jumps were performed on a force platform - from this test peak force was measured and peak power and vertical jump height were calculated. It was determined that age (r=-0.59; p<0.01), body mass (r=-0.52; p<0.01), lean mass (r=-0.61; p<0.01), vertical jump height (r=-0.67; p<0.01), peak power (r=-0.64; p<0.01), and peak force (r=-0.56; p<0.01) were correlated with time at 9.1 meters. Time-to-complete a 36.6 meter sprint was correlated with age (r=-0.71; p<0.01), body mass (r=-0.67; p<0.01), lean mass (r=-0.76; p<0.01), vertical jump height (r=-0.75; p<0.01), peak power (r=-0.78; p<0.01), and peak force (r=-0.69; p<0.01). These data indicate that soccer coaches desiring to improve speed in their athletes should devote substantive time to fitness programs that increase lean body mass and vertical force as well as power generating capabilities of their athletes. Additionally, vertical jump testing, with or without a force platform, may be a useful tool to screen soccer athletes for speed potential.","['Acceleration', 'Soccer', 'Soccer Screening', 'Speed', 'Talent Identification']"
Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Biomarkers in Neonates With Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"<b>Background:</b> Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) is a major contributor to child mortality and morbidity. Reliable prognostication for HIE is of key importance. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) is a quantitative, non-invasive method that has been demonstrated to be a suitable complementary tool for prediction. The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic capability of <sup>1</sup>H-MRS in the era of therapeutic hypothermia (TH). <b>Methods:</b> Databases, namely MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library (Cochrane Center Register of Controlled Trials), were searched for studies published before July 17, 2017. Study selection and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers. The mean difference (MD) or standardized MD (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated using random-effects models. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on the use of TH. <b>Results:</b> Among the 1,150 relevant studies, seven were included for meta-analysis, but only two small studies were conducted under TH. For <sup>1</sup>H-MRS measurement, three peak area ratios revealed predictive values for adverse outcomes in TH subgroup and the combined results (with and without TH): N-acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine in basal ganglia/thalamus (BG/T) in TH (MD -0.31, 95%CI -0.55 to -0.07) and combined results (MD -0.37, 95% CI -0.49 to -0.25); NAA/choline in BG/T in TH (MD -0.89, 95%CI -1.43 to -0.35) and combined results (MD -0.25, 95%CI -0.42 to -0.07); and myo-inositol/choline in cerebral cortex in TH (MD -1.94, 95%CI -3.69 to -0.19) and combined results (MD -1.64, 95%CI -2.64 to -0.64). Moreover, NAA relative concentration is associated with adverse outcomes: in TH (MD -0.04, 95%CI -0.06 to -0.02) and combined results (MD -0.06, 95%CI -0.11 to -0.01) in white matter; in TH (MD -0.04, 95%CI -0.07 to -0.01) and combined results (MD -0.05, 95%CI -0.07 to -0.02) in gray matter. <b>Conclusions:</b> NAA may be a potential marker in outcome prediction for all HIE subjects. It seems that MDs for the ratios including NAA are larger than for its relative concentration, and therefore are more likely to be measurable in a clinical context. Larger prospective multicenter studies with a standardized protocol for both measurement protocols and analysis methods are required in future studies.","['hypoxicischemic encephalopathy', 'neurodevelopmental outcome', 'prognostication', 'proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy', 'therapeutic hypothermia']"
Assessing Bias and Limitations of Clinical Validation Studies of Molecular Diagnostic Tests for Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"<b><i>Background:</i></b> Molecular tests for thyroid nodules with indeterminate fine needle aspiration results are increasingly used in clinical practice; however, true diagnostic summaries of these tests are unknown. A systematic review and meta-analysis were completed to (1) evaluate the accuracy of commercially available molecular tests for malignancy in indeterminate thyroid nodules and (2) quantify biases and limitations in studies that validate those tests. <b><i>Summary:</i></b> PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science were systematically searched through July 2021. English language articles that reported original clinical validation attempts of molecular tests for indeterminate thyroid nodules were included if they reported counts of true-negative, true-positive, false-negative, and false-positive results. We performed screening and full-text review, followed by assessment of eight common biases and limitations, extraction of diagnostic and histopathological information, and meta-analysis of clinical validity using a bivariate linear mixed-effects model. Forty-nine studies were included. Meta-analysis of Afirma Gene expression classifiers (GEC; <i>n</i> = 38 studies) revealed a sensitivity of 0.92 (confidence interval: 0.90-0.94), specificity of 0.26 (0.20-0.32), negative likelihood ratio (LR-) of 0.32 (0.23-0.44), positive LR+ of 1.24 (1.15-1.35), and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.83 (0.74-0.89). Afirma Genomic Sequencing Classifier (GSC; <i>n</i> = 10) had a sensitivity of 0.94 (0.89-0.96), specificity of 0.38 (0.27-0.50), LR- of 0.18 (0.10-0.30), LR+ of 1.52 (1.28-1.87), and AUC of 0.91 (0.62-0.92). ThyroSeq v1 and v2 (<i>n</i> = 10) had a sensitivity of 0.86 (0.82-0.90), specificity of 0.74 (0.59-0.85), LR- of 0.19 (0.13-0.26), LR+ of 3.52 (2.08-5.92), and AUC of 0.86 (0.81-0.90). ThyroSeq v3 (<i>n</i> = 6) had a sensitivity of 0.92 (0.86-0.95), specificity of 0.41 (0.18-0.69), LR- of 0.24 (0.09-0.62), LR+ of 1.67 (1.09-2.98), and AUC of 0.90 (0.63-0.92). Fourteen percent of studies conducted a blinded histopathologic review of excised thyroid nodules, and 8% made the decision to go to surgery blind to molecular test results. <b><i>Conclusions:</i></b> Meta-analyses reveal a high diagnostic accuracy of molecular tests for thyroid nodule assessment of malignancy risk; however, these studies are subject to several limitations. Limitations and their potential clinical impacts must be addressed and, when feasible, adjusted for using valid statistical methodologies.","['bias assessment', 'clinical validity', 'diagnostic tests', 'metaanalysis', 'molecular diagnostics', 'oncology', 'systematic review', 'thyroid cancer']"
Diffusion Tensor Imaging of the Uterine Zones Related to the Menstrual Cycle and Menopausal Status at 3 Tesla MRI.,"Diffusion and diffusion tensor imaging techniques (DTI) are widely available and used both in central nervous system and body imaging, including gynecological diseases.The aims of this study were to assess the capability of DTI of uterine zones in relation to the menstrual cycle and ascertain the normal apparent diffusion coefficient and fractional anisotropy values at 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).Prospective clinical study.A total of 13 young reproductive and 12 postmenopausal healthy volunteers were included in the study. MRI examination included sagittal T2-weighted and single-shot echo planar imaging DTI obtained under free breathing. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values of the endometrium, junctional zone, and myometrium were determined.The median (minimum-maximum) FA of the endometrium, myometrium, and junctional zone of the reproductive group were 0.31 (0.260-0.465), 0.42 (0.302-0.664), and 0.58 (0.420-0.745), respectively, in the proliferative phase and 0.26 (0.180-0.413), 0.48 (0.357-0.656), and 0.59 (0.490-0.675)], respectively, in the secretory phase. In the postmenopausal group, the FA values of the endometrium, myometrium, and junctional zone were 0.275 (0.136-0.425), 0.255 (0.191-0.553), and 0.27 (0.129-0.397), respectively. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values of the endometrium, myometrium, and junctional zone of the reproductive group were 1.25±0.254 (0.970-1.463), 1.67 (1.213-1.854), and 1.23 (0.853-1.301), respectively, in the proliferative phase and 1.32±0.283 (1.165-1.706), 1.55 (1.360-1.791), and 1.17 (1.163-1.705), respectively, in the secretory phase. In the postmenopausal group, the ADC values of the endometrium, myometrium, and junctional zone were measured as 1.100±0.192 (0.850-1.302), 1.14 (0.864-1.283), and 1.09 (0.912-1.291). The FA values of the endometrium and myometrium were lower in the secretory phase of the reproductive group, while ADC values were higher. However, both the FA and ADC values were lower in the postmenopausal group.The present study showed that uterine DTI is feasible when used quantitatively. While FA values tend to decrease, ADC values increase significantly in all zones in the secretory phase except the junctional zone. Zonal FA and ADC values of postmenopausal women are lower in comparison to those in young women.","['Diffusion tensor imaging', 'fractional anisotropy', 'menstrual cycle', 'uterus']"
A Comparison of Refractive Accuracy Between Conventional and Femtosecond Laser Cataract Surgery Techniques Using Modern IOL Formulas.,"To compare the refractive outcome prediction accuracy between conventional (CCS) and femtosecond laser assisted (FLACS) cataract surgery techniques using optimized lens constants for modern intraocular lens (IOL) formulas.Our retrospective, comparative, interventional case series, compared data from 196 eyes undergoing CCS and 456 eyes undergoing FLACS with Acrysof IOL (Alcon laboratories, Inc) implantation. After optimizing IOL constants, the predicted refractive outcome was calculated for all formulas for each case. This was compared to the actual refractive outcome to provide the prediction error. The performance of CCS and FLACS was compared by the absolute prediction error and percentage of eyes within 0.25D, 0.5D and 1.0D of anticipated refractive outcome.There was no statistically significant difference in median absolute error between the CCS and LACS groups for the Kane (0.256, 0.236; p=0.389), SRK T (0.298, 0.302, p=0.910), Holladay (0.312, 0.275; p=0.090), Hoffer Q (0.314, 0.289; p=0.330), Haigis (0.309, 0.258; p=0.177), Barrett Universal 2(0.250, 0.250; p=0.866), Holladay 2 (0.250, 0.258; p=0.860) and Olsen (0.260, 0.255; p=0.570) formulas. Similarly, there was no consistent difference between the two techniques for percentage of patients within 0.25, 0.50 and 1.0D of predicted refractive outcome for each formula.There was no difference in refractive outcome prediction accuracy between the CCS and FLACS techniques.","['IOL formulas', 'femtosecond laserassisted cataract surgery', 'refractive predictability']"
Effect of exercise on cardiovascular risk in sedentary postmenopausal women: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Exercise training has cardiovascular benefits, but its effects on cardiovascular disease risk factors in sedentary postmenopausal women are uncertain. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to explore the effects of exercise on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors in sedentary postmenopausal women.A literature search was conducted on the Web of Science, Cochrane, PubMed, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and WanFang databases for studies published between January 2010 and January 2022. All publications relating to clinical randomized control trials on the effects of exercise on CVD risk factors in sedentary postmenopausal women were collected. A meta-analysis was performed using STATA 16.0. We assessed the quality of the included literature using the Cochrane risk bias assessment tool.Of the 623 articles initially retrieved, 14 were included in the meta-analysis (250 and 223 individuals in the exercise and non-exercise groups, respectively). The meta-analysis showed that oxygen consumption [standardized mean difference (SMD) =1.21; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.38 to 2.05; P=0.004] and high-density lipoprotein (SMD =0.31; 95% CI: 0.08 to 0.54; P=0.008) were significantly higher in the exercise than non-exercise group; however, diastolic blood pressure (SMD =-0.81; 95% CI -1.38 to -0.24; P=0.005), systolic blood pressure (SMD =-0.98; 95% CI: -1.44 to -0.52; P=0.000), triglycerides (SMD =-0.48, 95% CI: -0.86 to -0.09; P=0.016), and body mass index (SMD =-0.94, 95% CI: -1.70 to -0.17; P=0.016) were markedly lower in the exercise group. There were no significant differences between the 2 groups in heart rate (SMD =-0.11; 95% CI: -0.92 to 0.70; P=0.796), cholesterol (SMD =-0.32; 95% CI: -0.79 to 0.15; P=0.186), or low-density lipoprotein (SMD =-0.23; 95% CI: -0.70 to 0.23; P=0.321).Aerobic exercise not only increases oxygen consumption, but also reduces CVD-related factors, such as blood pressure, lipid profile, and body mass index, in sedentary menopausal women. Put simply, regular exercise is a beneficial lifestyle intervention that can reduce CVD risk.","['Blood pressure', 'cardiovascular disease risk', 'exercise', 'metaanalysis', 'sedentary']"
Dysfunctional personality beliefs and executive performance in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.,"This article intends to verify the association of dysfunctional beliefs of personality disorders with the executive performance in people with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME).Fifty-two patients (35 women, 67.3%) with JME aged 18-50 yrs. (32.3 ± 9.7) were evaluated between May 2017 and April 2018 and compared with controls. All subjects were submitted to the Personality Beliefs Questionnaire (PBQ) (Beck & Beck, 1991; Savoia et al., 2006), Dysexecutive Questionnaire (DQ; Wilson et al., 1996; Macuglia et al., 2016), estimated intelligence quotient (IQ) using Vocabulary and Block Design tests, attention and executive functions evaluation (Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA), Digit Span, Trail Making Tests (TMT) A and B, Stroop and Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST)). The inclusion criteria were as follows: diagnosis of JME (ILAE, 1989); age ≥18 yrs., schooling ≥ 11 yrs. and IQ ≥70. The inclusion criteria for the control group were the same except diagnosis of epilepsy.Compared with controls, patients presented higher scores in PBQ for personality disorders, namely Narcissistic (z = -0.79; p < 0.001), Borderline (z = -0.58; p = 0.002), Paranoid (z = -0.43; p = 0.017), and Histrionic (z = -0.39; p = 0.041). Executive functions were impaired when compared with controls in TMT A (z = -0.97; p = 0.038), TMT B (z = -0.65; p = 0.023), and COWA (z = -0.51; p = 0.001). Patients showed higher WCST scores for Errors (z = -1.62; p ≤ 0.001), Perseverative Errors (z = -0.77; p = 0.001), Non-Perseverative Errors (z = -1.01; p = 0.001), Conceptual Level Response (z = -1.56; p ≤ 0.001), Completed Categories (z = -2.12; p = 0.002), and Failure to Maintain Context (z = -0.49; p = 0.015). Personality Beliefs Questionnaire results showed correlation with lower values in TMT A, Antisocial (r = -0.298; p = 0.032), Narcissistic (r = -0.303; p = 0.029), Schizoid (r = - 0.410; p = 0.003), Histrionic (r = -0.341; p = 0.013), Passive-aggressive (r = -0.341; p = 0.015), and Obsessive-compulsive (r = -0.319; p = 0.021); TMT B results showed a trend for Obsessive-compulsive traits (r = -0.261; p = 0.052); COWA was correlated to Dependent (r = 0.319; p = 0.021); and Digit Span to Passive-aggressive (r = 0.287; p = 0.039). On WCST, Failure to Maintain Context was correlated to Avoidant (r = 0.335; p = 0.017). The DQ was not correlated with PBQ.People with JME presented dysfunctional beliefs of personality disorder that were correlated with executive dysfunction. These findings reinforce the need for psychological rehabilitation in these patients.","['Dysfunctional personality beliefs', 'Executive functions', 'Executive performance', 'Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy']"
Impact of the cerebrospinal fluid-mask algorithm on the diagnostic performance of <sup>123</sup>I-Ioflupane SPECT: an investigation of parkinsonian syndromes.,"A cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-mask algorithm has been developed to reduce the adverse influence of CSF-low-counts on the diagnostic utility of the specific binding ratio (SBR) index calculated with Southampton method. We assessed the effect of the CSF-mask algorithm on the diagnostic performance of the SBR index for parkinsonian syndromes (PS), including Parkinson's disease, and the influence of cerebral ventricle dilatation on the CSF-mask algorithm.We enrolled 163 and 158 patients with and without PS, respectively. Both the conventional SBR (non-CSF-mask) and SBR corrected with the CSF-mask algorithm (CSF-mask) were calculated from <sup>123</sup>I-Ioflupane single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images of these patients. We compared the diagnostic performance of the corresponding indices and evaluated whether the effect of the CSF-mask algorithm varied according to the extent of ventricle dilatation, as assessed with the Evans index (EI). A receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) analysis was used for statistical analyses.ROC analyses demonstrated that the CSF-mask algorithm performed better than the non-CSF-mask (no correction, area under the curve [AUC] = 0.917 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.887-0.947] vs. 0.895 [95% CI 0.861-0.929], p < 0.001; attenuation correction, AUC = 0.930 [95% CI 0.902-0.957] vs. 0.903 [95% CI 0.870-0.936], p < 0.001). When not corrected for attenuation, no significant difference in the AUC was observed in the low EI group between the non-CSF-mask and CSF-mask algorithms (0.927 [95% CI 0.877-0.978] vs. 0.942 [95% CI 0.898-0.986], p = 0.11); in the middle and high EI groups, the CSF-mask algorithm performed better than the non-CSF-mask algorithm (middle EI group, AUC = 0.894 [95% CI 0.825-0.963] vs. 0.872 [95% CI 0.798-0.947], p < 0.05; high EI group, AUC = 0.931 [95% CI 0.883-0.978] vs. 0.900 [95% CI 0.840-0.961], p < 0.01). When corrected for attenuation, significant differences in the AUC were observed in all three EI groups (low EI group, AUC = 0.961 [95% CI 0.924-0.998] vs. 0.942 [95% CI 0.895-0.988], p < 0.05; middle EI group, AUC = 0.905 [95% CI 0.843-0.968] vs. 0.872 [95% CI 0.800-0.944], p < 0.005; high EI group, AUC = 0.954 [95% CI 0.917-0.991] vs. 0.917 [95% CI 0.862-0.973], p < 0.005).The CSF-mask algorithm improved the performance of the SBR index in informing the diagnosis of PS, especially in cases with ventricle dilatation.","['123IFPCIT', '123IIoflupane', 'CSFmask', 'DAT SPECT', 'Southampton method', 'Specific binding ratio']"
Systematic review and meta-analysis of cannabinoids in palliative medicine.,"We provide a systematic review and meta-analysis on the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of cannabinoids in palliative medicine. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, and http://clinicaltrials.gov, and a selection of cancer journals were searched up until 15th of March 2017. Of the 108 screened studies, nine studies with a total of 1561 participants were included. Overall, the nine studies were at moderate risk of bias. The quality of evidence comparing cannabinoids with placebo was rated according to Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation as low or very low because of indirectness, imprecision, and potential reporting bias. In cancer patients, there were no significant differences between cannabinoids and placebo for improving caloric intake (standardized mean differences [SMD]: 0.2 95% confidence interval [CI]: [-0.66, 1.06] P = 0.65), appetite (SMD: 0.81 95% CI: [-1.14, 2.75]; P = 0.42), nausea/vomiting (SMD: 0.21 [-0.10, 0.52] P = 0.19), >30% decrease in pain (risk differences [RD]: 0.07 95% CI: [-0.01, 0.16]; P = 0.07), or sleep problems (SMD: -0.09 95% CI: [-0.62, 0.43] P = 0.72). In human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients, cannabinoids were superior to placebo for weight gain (SMD: 0.57 [0.22; 0.92]; P = 0.001) and appetite (SMD: 0.57 [0.11; 1.03]; P = 0.02) but not for nausea/vomiting (SMD: 0.20 [-0.15, 0.54]; P = 0.26). Regarding side effects in cancer patients, there were no differences between cannabinoids and placebo in symptoms of dizziness (RD: 0.03 [-0.02; 0.08]; P = 0.23) or poor mental health (RD: -0.01 [-0.04; 0.03]; P = 0.69), whereas in HIV patients, there was a significant increase in mental health symptoms (RD: 0.05 [0.00; 0.11]; P = 0.05). Tolerability (measured by the number of withdrawals because of adverse events) did not differ significantly in cancer (RD: 1.15 [0.80; 1.66]; P = 0.46) and HIV patients (RD: 1.87 [0.60; 5.84]; P = 0.28). Safety did not differ in cancer (RD: 1.12 [0.86; 1.46]; P = 0.39) or HIV patients (4.51 [0.54; 37.45]; P = 0.32) although there was large uncertainty about the latter reflected in the width of the CI. In one moderate quality study of 469 cancer patients with cancer-associated anorexia, megestrol was superior to cannabinoids in improving appetite, producing >10% weight gain and tolerability. In another study comparing megestrol to dronabinol in HIV patients, megestrol treatment led to higher weight gain without any differences in tolerability and safety. We found no convincing, unbiased, high quality evidence suggesting that cannabinoids are of value for anorexia or cachexia in cancer or HIV patients.","['HIV', 'cancer', 'cannabinoids', 'marijuana', 'palliation', 'systematic review', 'weight gain']"
Estimates of genetic parameters for feeding behavior traits and their associations with feed efficiency in Holstein cows.,"Residual feed intake (RFI) is commonly used to measure feed efficiency but individual intake recording systems are needed. Feeding behavior may be used as an indicator trait for feed efficiency using less expensive precision livestock farming technologies. Our goal was to estimate genetic parameters for feeding behavior and the genetic correlations with feed efficiency in Holstein cows. Data consisted of 75,877 daily feeding behavior records of 1,328 mid-lactation Holstein cows in 31 experiments conducted from 2009 to 2020 with an automated intake recording system. Feeding behavior traits included number of feeder visits per day, number of meals per day, duration of each feeder visit, duration of each meal, total duration of feeder visits, intake per visit, intake per meal [kg of dry matter (DM)], feeding rate per visit, and feeding rate per meal (kg of DM per min). The meal criterion was estimated as 26.4 min, which means that any pair of feeder visits separated by less than 26.4 min were considered part of the same meal. The statistical model included lactation and days in milk as fixed effects, and experiment-treatment, animal, and permanent environment as random effects. Genetic parameters for feeding behavior traits were estimated using daily records and weekly averages. Estimates of heritability for daily feeding behavior traits ranged from 0.09 ± 0.02 (number of meals; mean ± standard error) to 0.23 ± 0.03 (feeding rate per meal), with repeatability estimates ranging from 0.23 ± 0.01 (number of meals) to 0.52 ± 0.02 (number of feeder visits). Estimates of heritability for weekly averages of feeding behavior traits ranged from 0.19 ± 0.04 (number of meals) to 0.32 ± 0.04 (feeding rate per visit), with repeatability estimates ranging from 0.46 ± 0.02 (duration of each meal) to 0.62 ± 0.02 (feeding rate per visit and per meal). Most of the feeding behavior measures were strongly genetically correlated, showing that with more visits or meals per day, cows spend less time in each feeder visit or meal with lower intake per visit or meal. Weekly averages for feeding behavior traits were analyzed jointly with RFI and its components. Number of meals was genetically correlated with milk energy (0.48), metabolic body weight (-0.27), and RFI (0.19). Duration of each feeder visit and meal were genetically correlated with milk energy (0.43 and 0.44, respectively). Total duration of feeder visits per day was genetically correlated with DM intake (0.29), milk energy (0.62), metabolic body weight (-0.37), and RFI (0.20). Intake per visit and meal were genetically correlated with DM intake (0.63 and 0.87), milk energy (0.47 and 0.69), metabolic body weight (0.47 and 0.68), and RFI (0.31 and 0.65). Feeding rate was genetically correlated with DM intake (0.69), metabolic body weight (0.67), RFI (0.47), and milk energy (0.21). We conclude that measures of feeding behavior could be useful indicators of dairy cow feed efficiency, and individual cows that eat at a slower rate may be more feed efficient.","['feeding rate', 'genetic correlation', 'heritability', 'meal', 'residual feed intake']"
Relationship between Egg Consumption and Metabolic Syndrome. A Meta-Analysis of Observational Studies.,"Aims: To explore the association between egg consumption and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the adult population.The PubMed, Web of Science and Embase electronic databases were searched up to December 2021 for observational studies on the association between egg consumption and MetS in the adult population. The pooled relative risk (RR) of MetS for the highest versus lowest category of egg consumption, and the standard mean difference (SMD) of egg consumption for MetS versus control subjects were calculated. Egg consumption was assessed by a food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and the 24-hour recall method. The criteria for MetS were National Cholesterol Education Program-Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III), International Diabetes Federation (IDF), Joint Interim Statement (JIS) and American Heart Association (AHA).A total of 19 articles with 20 observational studies (331667 participants) were included in this meta-analysis. The overall multivariable adjusted RR (18 studies included) demonstrated that higher egg consumption was associated with a lower probability of having MetS (RR=0.92, 95%CI: 0.88 to 0.96; P<0.001). Subgroup analysis confirmed these findings in cross-sectional studies (RR=0.91, 95% CI: 0.88 to 0.95; P<0.001), studies that used the NCEP ATP III criteria (RR=0.94, 95% CI: 0.89 to 0.99; P=0.02), Asia (RR=0.92, 95% CI: 0.86 to 0.99; P=0.02), studies with samples sizes >5000 (RR=0.92, 95% CI: 0.86 to 0.96; P<0.001), studies that adjusted body mass index (BMI) (RR=0.90, 95% CI: 0.86 to 0.95; P<0.001) and energy intake (RR=0.89, 95% CI: 0.83 to 0.94; P<0.001) and high-quality studies (RR=0.91, 95% CI: 0.88 to 0.95; P<0.001). Moreover, the overall combined SMD (5 studies included) showed that the level of egg consumption in subjects with MetS was also lower than that in control subjects. (SMD=-0.22, 95% CI: -0.25 to -0.20; P<0.001). Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that this finding only existed in studies with samples sizes >5000 (SMD=-0.21, 95% CI: -0.29 to -0.12; P<0.001) and high-quality studies (SMD=-0.23, 95% CI: -0.26 to -0.20; P<0.001).Our results suggest that higher egg consumption is associated with a lower probability of having MetS in the adult population. However, due to the limited evidence, more global well-designed prospective cohort studies are still needed.","['Egg consumption', 'clinical nutrition', 'metaanalysis', 'metabolic syndrome', 'observational study']"
Altered hippocampal connectivity dynamics predicts memory performance in neuropsychiatric lupus: a resting-state fMRI study using cross-recurrence quantification analysis.,"Τo determine whole-brain and regional functional connectivity (FC) characteristics of patients with neuropsychiatric SLE (NPSLE) or without neuropsychiatric manifestations (non-NPSLE) and examine their association with cognitive performance.Cross-recurrence quantification analysis (CRQA) of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data was performed in 44 patients with NPSLE, 20 patients without NPSLE and 35 healthy controls (HCs). Volumetric analysis of total brain and specific cortical and subcortical regions, where significant connectivity changes were identified, was performed. Cognitive status of patients with NPSLE was assessed by neuropsychological tests. Group comparisons on nodal FC, global network metrics and regional volumetrics were conducted, and associations with cognitive performance were estimated (at p<0.05 false discovery rate corrected).FC in patients with NPSLE was characterised by increased modularity (mean (SD)=0.31 (0.06)) as compared with HCs (mean (SD)=0.27 (0.06); p=0.05), hypoconnectivity of the left (mean (SD)=0.06 (0.018)) and right hippocampi (mean (SD)=0.051 (0.0.16)), and of the right amygdala (mean (SD)=0.091 (0.039)), as compared with HCs (mean (SD)=0.075 (0.022), p=0.02; 0.065 (0.019), p=0.01; 0.14 (0.096), p=0.05, respectively). Hyperconnectivity of the left angular gyrus (NPSLE/HCs: mean (SD)=0.29 (0.26) and 0.10 (0.09); p=0.01), left (NPSLE/HCs: mean (SD)=0.16 (0.09) and 0.09 (0.05); p=0.01) and right superior parietal lobule (SPL) (NPSLE/HCs: mean (SD)=0.25 (0.19) and 0.13 (0.13), p=0.01) was noted in NPSLE versus HC groups. Among patients with NPSLE, verbal episodic memory scores were positively associated with connectivity (local efficiency) of the left hippocampus (r<sup>2</sup>=0.22, p=0.005) and negatively with local efficiency of the left angular gyrus (r<sup>2</sup>=0.24, p=0.003). Patients without NPSLE displayed hypoconnectivity of the right hippocampus (mean (SD)=0.056 (0.014)) and hyperconnectivity of the left angular gyrus (mean (SD)=0.25 (0.13)) and SPL (mean (SD)=0.17 (0.12)).By using dynamic CRQA of the rs-fMRI data, distorted FC was found globally, as well as in medial temporal and parietal brain regions in patients with SLE, that correlated significantly and adversely with memory capacity in NPSLE. These results highlight the value of dynamic approaches to assessing impaired brain network function in patients with lupus with and without neuropsychiatric symptoms.","['Lupus Erythematosus', 'Systemic', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Psychology']"
Noninvasive Liver Fibrosis Staging: Comparison of MR Elastography with Extracellular Volume Fraction Analysis Using Contrast-Enhanced CT.,"Purpose: To compare the accuracy of liver fibrosis staging with MR elastography and of staging with extracellular volume fraction (fECV) analysis using contrast-enhanced CT. Methods: This retrospective study included 60 patients who underwent both MR elastography and contrast-enhanced CT before liver surgery between October 2013 and July 2020. Two radiologists independently measured liver stiffness of MR elastography and fECV of CT images. Accuracy for liver fibrosis staging was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Correlations between liver stiffness or fECV and liver fibrosis were also evaluated by means of the Spearman rank correlation coefficient. Results: The areas under the ROC curves for MR elastography for each stage differentiation of ≥F1 (0.85, 0.82 for the two radiologists), ≥F2 (0.88, 0.89), ≥F3 (0.87, 0.86), and F4 (0.84, 0.83) were greater than those for fECV analysis with CT (0.64, p = 0.06, 0.69, p = 0.2; 0.62, p < 0.005, 0.63, p < 0.005; 0.62, p < 0.005, 0.62, p < 0.01; and 0.70, p = 0.08, 0.71, p = 0.2, respectively). The correlation coefficients between liver stiffness and liver fibrosis in A0 (0.67, 0.69 for the two radiologists), A1 (0.64, 0.66) and A2 group (0.58, 0.51) were significantly higher than those between fECV and liver fibrosis (0.28, 0.30; 0.27, 0.31; and 0.23, 0.07; p < 0.05 for all comparisons). Conclusion: MR elastography allows for more accurate liver fibrosis staging compared with fECV analysis with CT. In addition, MR elastography may be less affected than fECV analysis by the inflammatory condition.","['CT', 'MR elastography', 'extracellular volume fraction', 'liver fibrosis']"
Artificial intelligence-based detection of aortic stenosis from chest radiographs.,"We aimed to develop models to detect aortic stenosis (AS) from chest radiographs-one of the most basic imaging tests-with artificial intelligence.We used 10 433 retrospectively collected digital chest radiographs from 5638 patients to train, validate, and test three deep learning models. Chest radiographs were collected from patients who had also undergone echocardiography at a single institution between July 2016 and May 2019. These were labelled from the corresponding echocardiography assessments as AS-positive or AS-negative. The radiographs were separated on a patient basis into training [8327 images from 4512 patients, mean age 65 ±  (standard deviation) 15 years], validation (1041 images from 563 patients, mean age 65 ± 14 years), and test (1065 images from 563 patients, mean age 65 ± 14 years) datasets. The soft voting-based ensemble of the three developed models had the best overall performance for predicting AS with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.77-0.88), 0.78 (0.67-0.86), 0.71 (0.68-0.73), 0.71 (0.68-0.74), 0.18 (0.14-0.23), and 0.97 (0.96-0.98), respectively, in the validation dataset and 0.83 (0.78-0.88), 0.83 (0.74-0.90), 0.69 (0.66-0.72), 0.71 (0.68-0.73), 0.23 (0.19-0.28), and 0.97 (0.96-0.98), respectively, in the test dataset.Deep learning models using chest radiographs have the potential to differentiate between radiographs of patients with and without AS.We created artificial intelligence (AI) models using deep learning to identify aortic stenosis (AS) from chest radiographs. Three AI models were developed and evaluated with 10 433 retrospectively collected radiographs and labelled from echocardiography reports. The ensemble AI model could detect AS in a test dataset with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 (95% confidence interval 0.78-0.88). Since chest radiography is a cost-effective and widely available imaging test, our model can provide an additive resource for the detection of AS.","['Aortic stenosis', 'Artificial intelligence', 'Chest radiography', 'Deep learning']"
Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios in juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus: correlation with disease manifestations.,"This retrospective study aimed to investigate the usefulness of neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR) for organ involvement and disease activity in newly diagnosed juvenile systemic lupus erythematosus (jSLE).A total of 186 jSLE inpatients were included for analysis. All participants' clinical characteristics and laboratory data were obtained from medical records. The Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index 2000 (SLEDAI-2K) score scale was used to assess disease activity. Mann-Whitney U test and Kruskal-Wallis test were performed for non-parametric variables between the groups. Spearman rank correlation coefficient was used to analyze correlations between variables.The NLR was significantly higher in participants with serositis as compared those without serositis [2.72 (1.71-5.0) vs. 2.08 (1.42-3.15), P=0.038]. The PLR was significantly higher in participants manifesting symptoms of cutaneous rash [130.0 (92.6-235.0) vs. 112.0 (49.3-169.0), P=0.002], and arthritis [167.0 (106.0-243.0) vs. 106.0 (53.6-176.0), P<0.001], as compared to participants without such involvement. The PLR in participants with hematological involvement was significantly lower than in those without such involvement [111.0 (53.6-191.0) vs. 138.0 (107.0-185.0), P=0.016]. The PLR in participants with positive anti-Smith (anti-Sm) antibody was significantly higher than that in those with negative anti-Sm antibody [140.0 (91.6-228.0) vs. 114.0 (60.9-176.0), P=0.006]. The NLR showed positive correlations with serositis (r=0.153, P=0.037), complement C3 and C4 (r=0.152, P=0.038 and r=0.177, P=0.016, respectively). The PLR showed positive correlations with cutaneous rash (r=0.227, P=0.002), arthritis (r=0.290, P<0.001), anti-Sm antibodies (r=0.20, P=0.006) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR, r=0.159, P=0.03). Negative correlations were found between PLR and hematological involvement (r=-0.177, P=0.015).Both the NLR and PLR had correlations with serological indicators, and may predict organ involvement in jSLE, particularly cutaneous, arthritis, serositis, and haematological involvement.","['Systemic lupus erythematosus SLE', 'neutrophiltolymphocyte ratio', 'platelettolymphocyte ratio']"
Comparison of Plusoptix S12R photoscreener with cycloplegic retinoscopy and autorefraction in pediatric age group.,"To compare refractive measurements of noncycloplegic photoscreener Plusoptix S12R with cycloplegic retinoscopy, noncycloplegic autorefractor, and cycloplegic autorefractor in children.The study population (200 eyes of 100 children) was divided into two groups: Group 1 (age 3-7 years) and Group 2 (age 8-15 years). In Group 1, Plusoptix was compared with cycloplegic retinoscopy. In Group 2, Plusoptix was compared with cycloplegic retinoscopy and autorefraction. The second group was made because the younger group was found to be uncooperative for autorefraction. Paired t-test and Pearson's correlation were used for statistical analysis.The mean difference in sphere (DS), spherical equivalent (DSE), and cylinder (DC) between cycloplegic retinoscopy and Plusoptix in Group 1 was 0.68 ± 0.55 (P < 0.001), 0.77 ± 0.61 (P < 0.001), and 0.18 ± 0.28 (P < 0.001), respectively. In Group 2, DS, DSE, and DC between cycloplegic retinoscopy and Plusoptix were 0.86 ± 0.49 (P < 0.001), 0.97 ± 0.51 (P < 0.001), and 0.23 ± 0.28 (P < 0.001); between cycloplegic autorefractor and Plusoptix were 0.69 ± 0.47 (P < 0.001), 0.74 ± 0.49 (P < 0.001), and 0.10 ± 0.31 (P = 0.002); and between noncycloplegic autorefractor and Plusoptix were - 0.25 ± 0.39 (P < 0.001), -0.19 ± 0.41 (P < 0.001), and 0.11 ± 0.31 (P < 0.001), respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficients of S, SE, and C between Plusoptix and cycloplegic retinoscopy were 0.948, 0.938, and 0.924 in Group 1 and 0.972, 0.972, and 0.946 in Group 2, and these values were statistically significant. Bland-Altman plots showed good agreement between cycloplegic retinoscopy and Plusoptix in both groups. Plusoptix gave axis values within 10° of cycloplegic retinoscopy in 81.56% of eyes in Group 1 and in 71.44% of eyes in Group 2.Plusoptix photoscreener can be used for prescription of axis of cylinder in children; however, other refractive measurements must be refined by cycloplegic retinoscopy.","['Amblyopia', 'photoscreener', 'refractive errors']"
Clinical and Prognostic Significance of Baseline Serum Vitamin D Levels in Hospitalized Egyptian Covid-19 Patients.,"Vitamin D is a hormone with essential roles in both cellular metabolism and immunity. It controls calcium homeostasis and modulates innate and adaptive immune system responses. Many studies suggested an association between vitamin D deficiency and clinical outcomes of covid-19 infection, while others failed to document such a relation. The present study aimed to evaluate the clinical and prognostic significance of baseline vitamin D levels in hospitalized Egyptian covid-19 patients.The present retrospective study included 300 hospitalized covid-19 patients. Patients were submitted to standard clinical, laboratory, and radiological assessment. According to vitamin D levels, patients were classified to have normal levels (≥30), insufficient levels (20-29) or deficient levels (<20).According to their vitamin D levels, patients were classified into those with normal vitamin D (<i>n</i>=135), others with vitamin D insufficiency (<i>n</i>=114), and a third group with vitamin D deficiency (<i>n</i>=51). Patients with normal vitamin D levels and vitamin D insufficiency are significantly younger [median (IQR): 49.0 (39.0-57.0) versus 51.0 (40.0-61.0) and 55.0 (43.0-62.0) years, respectively, <i>p</i>=0.012] and had less frequency of severe disease (24.4% versus 40.4% and 51.0%, respectively) when compared with those with vitamin D deficiency. Moreover, they had significantly lower levels of D dimer [median (IQR): 1.5 (0.9-2.5) versus 1.8 (0.9-3.1) and 2.0 (1.0-3.2)], CRP [median (IQR): 58.0 (30.0-120.0) versus 76.0 (42.5-160.0) and 105.0 (74.0-208.0), respectively, <i>p</i><0.001], ferritin [median (IQR): 458.0 (240.0-759.0) versus 606.0 (433.8-897.8) and 820.0 (552.0-1087.0), respectively, <i>p</i><0.001], and procalcitonin [median (IQR): 290.0 (152.0-394.0) versus 372.5 (227.0-530.5) and 443.0 (272.0-575.0), respectively, <i>p</i><0.001]. Only lower vitamin D levels were significant predictors of mortality in multivariate analysis [OR (95% CI): 0.88 (0.84-0.92), <i>p</i><0.001].Low vitamin D levels are related to exaggerated inflammatory response, disease severity, and poor clinical outcome in hospitalized covid-19 patients.","['covid19', 'vitamin D', 'vitamin D deficiency']"
Detection of occludable angle with anterior segment optical coherence tomography and Pentacam as non-contact screening methods.,"To evaluate diagnostic capacity for occludable anterior chamber angle detection with anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) and Pentacam.Observational cross-sectional study with AS-OCT and Pentacam. AS-OCT measures: angle opening distance from Schwalbe line (SL) perpendicular (AOD-SL-Perp) and vertical to iris (AOD-SL-Vert), and iridotrabecular angle (ITA). Pentacam measures: anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior chamber volume (ACV), and anterior chamber angle (ACA). We analysed Spearman's correlation with gonioscopic classification. Area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) for occludable angle detection were compared. Agreement between iridocorneal values of methods was evaluated.Seventy-four left eyes of 74 patients. Correlation between temporal AS-OCT and gonioscopy: 0.83 (p < 0.0001) AOD-SL-Perp temporal, 0.82 (p < 0.0001) AOD-SL-Vert temporal, and 0.69 (p < 0.0001) ITA temporal. Correlation between AS-OCT nasal and gonioscopy: 0.74 (p < 0.0001) AOD-SL-Perp nasal, 0.74 (p < 0.0001) AOD-SL-Vert nasal, and 0.70 (p < 0.0001) ITA nasal. Correlation of Pentacam with temporal gonioscopy: 0.57 (p < 0.0001) ACD, 0.56 (p < 0.0001) ACV, and 0.63 (p < 0.0001) ACA. Correlation of Pentacam with nasal gonioscopy: 0.47 (IC 0.27-0.73, p < 0.0001) ACD, 0.49 (p < 0.0001) ACV, and 0.56 (CI 0.38-0.7, p < 0.0001) ACA. AS-OCT AUCs: AOD-SL-Perp temporal 0.89 (CI 0.80-0.95), AOD-SL-Vert 0.87 (CI 0.77-0.94), ITA temporal 0.88 (CI 0.78-0.94), AOD-SL-Perp nasal 0.83 (CI 0.72-0.91), AOD-SL-Vert nasal 0.87 (CI 0.77-0.94), and ITA nasal 0.91 (IC 0.81-0.96). Pentacam AUCs: ACD 0.76 (CI 0.64-0.85), ACV 0.75 (CI 0.63-0.84), and ACA 0.84 (CI 0.74-0.92). No statistical differences between different AUCs. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of ACA (Pentacam) with ITA temporal (AS-OCT) 0.59 and with nasal ITA nasal (AS-OCT) 0.65.Both systems show high capacity for non-contact occludable angle detection. But agreement between methods is moderate or low.","['ASOCT', 'Occludable angle', 'Pentacam']"
Study of the association between five polymorphisms and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma: A meta-analysis.,"Recently, several studies have investigated the association between polymorphisms in miR-146a rs2910164, miR-196a2 rs11614913, miR-499 rs3746444, miR-149 rs229283, miR-34b/c rs4938723, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), which showed inconclusive results.A publication search was performed in PubMed, ExcerptaMedica Database, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure to collect relevant medical data published through February 2016. The aim of this study was to ascertain the association between HCC and micro-RNAs. A total of 21 studies were included in our study, which showed that miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism has a significant association with HCC in the allele, recessive, and homozygous models overall [allele model: odds ratio (OR) = 0.927, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.869-0.988, p = 0.02; recessive model: OR = 0.893, 95% CI: 0.814-0.981, p = 0.018; homozygous model: OR = 0.853, 95% CI: 0.744-0.978, p = 0.023] and in Asian populations (allele model: OR = 0.921, 95% CI: 0.863-0.983, p = 0.014; recessive model: OR = 0.893, 95% CI: 0.814-0.981, p = 0.019; homozygous model: OR = 0.851, 95% CI: 0.741-0.977, p = 0.022). For miR-196a2 rs11614913, significant statistical heterogeneity overall and in Asian populations was identified in the comparison of the allele, recessive, homozygous, and heterozygous models (overall: allele model: OR = 0.889, 95% CI: 0.842-0.94, p < 0.001; recessive model: OR = 0.837, 95% CI: 0.723-0.970, p = 0.018; homozygous model: OR = 0.722, 95%CI: 0.575-0.906, p = 0.005; heterozygous model: OR = 0.532, 95% CI: 0.37-0.765, p = 0.001), and also has a decreased risk of HCC in Caucasians in all genetic models except for the heterozygous model (allele model: OR = 0.658, 95% CI: 0.49-0.885, p = 0.006; dominant model: OR = 0.641, 95% CI: 0.418-0.981, p = 0.041; recessive model: OR = 0.489, 95% CI: 0.278-0.862, p = 0.013; homozygous model: OR = 0.414, 95% CI: 0.222-0.772, p = 0.005). Only the recessive models produced a significant association between miR-499 rs3746444 polymorphism and HCC risk (recessive model: OR = 1.283, 95% CI: 1.008-1.632, p = 0.043).The analysis for miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphisms by racial decent found the same association between miR-146a rs2910164 polymorphism and susceptibility to HCC in Asians, but no significance risk association was observed in Caucasians. The meta-analysis results showed that miR-196a2 rs11614913 was associated with a decreased risk of HCC in Caucasians in all genetic models except for the heterozygous model. In the Asian population, miR-499 rs3746444 polymorphism was associated with a decreased risk of HCC in recessive models. This meta-analysis showed that no significant statistical heterogeneity was identified in miR-149 rs2292832 and miR-34b/c rs4938723.Our findings supported the proposition that the polymorphisms of miR-146a rs2910164, miR-196a2 rs11614913, and miR-196a2 rs11614913 may contribute to the susceptibility of HCC.","['hepatocellular carcinoma', 'metaanalysis', 'microRNA', 'polymorphisms']"
Measuring the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on solid organ transplantation.,"The COVID-19 pandemic has uniquely affected the United States. We hypothesize that transplantation would be uniquely affected.In this population-based cohort study, adult transplantation data were examined as time series data. Autoregressive-integrated-moving-average models of transplantation rates were developed using data from 1990 to 2019 to forecast the 2020 expected rates in a theoretical scenario if the pandemic did not occur to generate observed-to-expected (O/E) ratios.32,594 transplants were expected in 2020, and only 30,566 occurred (O/E 0.94, CI 0.88-0.99). 58,152 waitlist registrations were expected and 50,241 occurred (O/E 0.86, CI 0.80-0.94). O/E ratios of transplants were kidney 0.92 (0.86-0.98), liver 0.96 (0.89-1.04), heart 1.05 (0.91-1.23), and lung 0.92 (0.82-1.04). O/E ratios of registrations were kidney 0.84 (0.77-0.93), liver 0.95 (0.86-1.06), heart 0.99 (0.85-1.18), and lung 0.80 (0.70-0.94).The COVID-19 pandemic was associated with a significant deficit in transplantation. The impact was strongest in kidney transplantation and waitlist registration.","['ARIMA', 'COVID19', 'Forecasting', 'Transplantation']"
Interchangeability of corneal curvature and asphericity measurements provided by three different devices.,"To evaluate the interchangeability of keratometric and asphericity measurements provided by three measurement systems based on different optical principles.A total of 40 eyes of 40 patients with a mean age of 34.1y were included. In all cases, a corneal curvature analysis was performed with IOL-Master (IOLM), iDesign 2 (ID2), and Sirius systems (SIR). Differences between instruments for flattest (K1) and steepest (K2) keratometric readings, as well as for magnitude and axis of corneal astigmatism were analyzed. Likewise, differences in asphericity (Q) between SIR and ID2 were also evaluated.Mean differences between devices for K1 were 0.20±0.21 (<i>P</i><0.001), -0.12±0.36 (<i>P</i>=0.046) and -0.32±0.36 D (<i>P</i><0.001) for the comparisons IOLM-SIR, IOLM-ID2 and SIR-ID2, respectively. The ranges of agreement for these comparisons between instruments were 0.41, 0.70, and 0.70 D. For K2, mean differences were 0.31±0.33 (<i>P</i><0.001), -0.08±0.43 (<i>P</i>=0.265) and -0.39±0.38 D (<i>P</i><0.001), with ranges of agreement of 0.65, 0.84, and 0.74 D. Concerning magnitude of astigmatism, ranges of agreement were in the limit of clinical relevance (0.49 D, <i>P</i>=0.011; 0.55 D, <i>P</i>=0.386; 0.43 D, <i>P</i>=0.05). In contrast, ranges of agreement were clinically relevant for astigmatic axis (26.68°, 33.83° and 18.37°, <i>P</i>≥0.121) and for Q between SIR and ID2 (0.16, <i>P</i><0.001).The keratometric corneal power, astigmatic axis and asphericity measurements provide by the three systems evaluated cannot be considered as interchangeable, whereas measurements of corneal astigmatism obtained with SIR and ID2 can be considered as interchangeable for clinical purposes.","['astigmatism', 'corneal asphericity', 'corneal topography', 'keratometry']"
Interaction effect of hypertension and obesity on left atrial phasic function: a three-dimensional echocardiography study.,"Hypertension (HT) and obesity often coexist and contribute to left atrial (LA) dysfunction. The present study aimed to compare LA function in hypertensive individuals and control participants with different body mass index (BMI) categories and to explore whether there is an interaction effect between HT and obesity on LA function.In this cross-sectional study, a total of 258 individuals (145 hypertensive and 113 non-hypertensive patients) were prospectively enrolled from Fuwai Central China Cardiovascular Hospital from September 2020 to November 2021. Hypertensive and non-hypertensive patients were both divided into three study subgroups (n=35 per group) according to their BMI: normal weight (BMI 18.5-<25 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), overweight (BMI 25-<30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), and obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) groups. LA volume and strain parameters were obtained using three-dimensional echocardiography.A significant interaction effect between HT and obesity on LA function was observed [P<sub>Interaction</sub> =0.04, 0.03, 0.005, 0.01, and 0.002 for LA ejection fraction (LAEF), LA passive ejection fraction (LAPEF), LA active ejection fraction (LAAEF), LA reservoir longitudinal strain (LASr), and LA contraction longitudinal strain (LASct), respectively; P<sub>Interaction</sub> <0.001 for LA conduit longitudinal strain (LAScd)]. Univariate correlation analysis revealed that HT [LASr, r=-0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.62 to -0.42, P<0.001; LAScd, r=-0.49, 95% CI: -0.58 to -0.39, P<0.001; and LASct, r=-0.46, 95% CI: -0.55 to -0.34, P<0.001] and BMI categories (LASr, r=-0.68, 95% CI: -0.75 to -0.61, P<0.001; LAScd, r=-0.47, 95% CI: -0.57 to -0.35, P<0.001; and LASct, r=-0.73, 95% CI: -0.78 to -0.66, P<0.001) were negatively correlated with LA strains. A generalized linear model further demonstrated that there was an interaction effect between HT and obesity on LA strains after adjusting for confounding factors (Model 2: LASr, <i>β</i><sub>HT*Obesity</sub> =-1.91, 95% CI: -3.48 to -0.35, P=0.01; LAScd, <i>β</i><sub>HT*Obesity</sub> =-3.26, 95% CI: -4.83 to -1.70, P<0.001; LASct, <i>β</i><sub>HT*Overweight</sub> =-1.97, 95% CI: -3.03 to -0.91, P<0.001; <i>β</i><sub>HT*Obesity</sub> =-1.54, 95% CI: -2.67 to -0.41, P=0.007).Both HT and increasing BMI category had an adverse effect on LA function. The coexistence of HT and obesity further impaired LA performance in an interaction manner. Weight loss is essential to reduce the incidence of adverse cardiovascular events in hypertensive patients.","['Hypertension', 'interaction effect', 'left atrial function', 'obesity', 'threedimensional echocardiography']"
Platelet parameters and the association with morbidity and mortality in Preterm Infants.,"There is growing recognition of the role of platelets in inflammation and immune responses, and platelets have been associated with various cardiovascular diseases. It is also known that neonatal morbidities are related to overall platelet activity, and platelet parameters may have the potential to predict morbidities and mortality in preterm infants. This study aimed to assess the initial platelet parameters and the association with major morbidities and mortality in preterm neonates.We retrospectively reviewed data from very preterm neonates with a gestational age (GA) <32 weeks who were admitted between June 2020 and May 2021 for platelet parameters (counts, mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW) and plateletcrit (platelet counts x MPV/10000(%)) at birth. Major morbidities included early- onset sepsis (EOS) ≤3 days after birth, severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) grade ≥3, and early or overall mortality.A total of 197 very preterm neonates were studied. Their mean (±SD) GA was 28.0 ± 2.4 weeks, birth weight was 990 ± 293 g, platelet counts were 245 ± 81 x1000/μL, MPV was 10.0 ± 0.7 fl, PDW was 11.0 ± 1.6 fl, and plateletcrit was 0.24 ± 0.08%. MPV had a weak negative correlation with both GA (r = -0.234, p = 0.001) and BW (r = -0.343, p <0.001). A lower plateletcrit was associated with EOS (0.14 (0.04-0.22) % vs. 0.23 (0.19-0.30) %, p = 0.027), severe IVH ≤7 days after birth (0.18 (0.14-0.27) % vs. 0.23 (0.20-0.30) %, p = 0.022), and early and overall mortality (0.15 (0.20-0.30) % vs. 0.23 (0.20-0.30) %, p = 0.049; 0.20 ± 0.09 % vs. 0.25 ± 0.07 %, p = 0.008).A lower plateletcrit within 24 hours of birth was associated with EOS, severe IVH ≤7 days after birth, and first-week and overall mortality in very preterm neonates.","['Morbidity', 'Platelet', 'Plateletcrit', 'Preterm infants']"
"Impact of leachate on quality of ground water around Chunga Landfill, Lusaka, Zambia and possible health risks.","We report the characteristics and possible impact of leachate on quality of groundwater in the Chunga Landfill area of Lusaka, Zambia. Water and leachate samples were collected within and around the landfill for analysis. The pH, biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), nitrates, sulphates, chlorides for the leachate and groundwater samples were (6.6 ± 0.1 to 8.7 ± 0.0), (1.7 ± 0.3 to 1,569.6 ± 4.9 mg/L), (4.0 ± 0.0 to 10,378.5 ± 59.2 mg/L), (8.0 ± 0.0 to 37.7 ± 0.4 mg/L), (11.7 ± 0.0 to 273.1 ± 1.7 mg/L), (43.0 ± 1.2 to 974.2 ± 0.8 mg/L) respectively. Heavy metal concentration ranges were cadmium (0.004 ± 0.000 to 1.149 ± 0.021 mg/L, chromium (0.007 ± 0.000 to 2.699 ± 0.039 mg/L), copper (0.013 ± 0.002 to 0.246 ± 0.005 mg/L), lead (0.062 ± 0.005 to 2.591 ± 0.065 mg/L) and zinc (0.008 ± 0.001 to 2.032 ± 0.017 mg/L). The pH of the leachate (8.5 ± 0.0 to 8.7 ± 0.0) meant the landfill was in the methane fermentation phase. An indexing approach was used with the leachate pollution index (LPI) of 30.173, heavy metal pollution index (HPI) of 3,938.92. The heavy metal index (HMI) for copper, lead, chromium, cadmium and zinc were found to be 0.92, 1,124.19, 47.20, 994.17 and 1.48 respectively. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed that anthropogenic activities contributed to pollution with high loading values. Ash from continuous burning of the waste may provide alkalinity which reduces leachate BOD and COD. Results showed that the landfill has outgrown the designed cells capacity as not all leachate was collected by the under-drainage. Results also showed that lack of adequate landfill cover significantly increases rainfall infiltration thereby increasing volumes of leachate produced with a, hence potential for underground water contamination and a human health and environmental problem.","['Landfill', 'Leachate', 'Municipal solid waste', 'Public health', 'Water contamination']"
"Public trust is earned: Historical discrimination, carceral violence, and the COVID-19 pandemic.","To assess whether knowledge of Tuskegee, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency's detainment of children, and satisfaction with the George Floyd death investigation were associated with trust in actors involved in the development and distribution of coronavirus vaccines.National survey with a convenience sample of Black (n = 1019) and Hispanic (n = 994) adults between July 1 and 26, 2021.Observational study using stratified adjusted logistic regression models to measure the association between ratings of the trustworthiness of actors involved in the development and distribution of coronavirus vaccines.Among Black respondents, lower satisfaction with the George Floyd death investigation was associated with lower trustworthiness ratings of pharmaceutical companies (ME: -0.09; CI: -0.15, 0.02), the FDA (ME: -0.07; CI: -0.14, -0.00), the Trump Administration (ME: -0.09; CI: -0.16, -0.02), the Biden Administration (ME: -0.07, CI: -0.10, 0.04), and elected officials (ME: -0.10, CI: -0.18, -0.03). Among Hispanic respondents, lower satisfaction was associated with lower trustworthiness ratings of the Trump Administration (ME: -0.14, CI: -0.22, -0.06) and elected officials (ME: -0.11; CI: -0.19, -0.02). Greater knowledge of ICE's detainment of children and families among Hispanic respondents was associated with lower trustworthiness ratings of state elected officials (ME: -0.09, CI: -0.16, 0.01). Greater knowledge of the US Public Health Service Study of Syphilis in Tuskegee was associated with higher trustworthiness ratings of their usual source of care (ME: 0.09; CI: 0.28, 0.15) among Black respondents (ME: 0.09; CI: 0.01, 0.16).Among Black respondents, lower satisfaction with the George Floyd death investigation was associated with lowered levels of trust in pharmaceutical companies, some government officials, and administrators; it was not associated with the erosion of trust in direct sources of health care delivery, information, or regulation. Among Hispanic respondents, greater knowledge of the ICE detainments was associated with lower trustworthiness ratings of elected state officials. Paradoxically, higher knowledge of the Study of Syphilis in Tuskegee was associated with higher trustworthiness ratings in usual sources of care.","['health equity', 'questionnaire design', 'social determinants of health', 'survey research']"
Influencing factors of humanistic care ability and its dimensions among mental health workers during the COVID-19 pandemic: an online cross-sectional study.,"In psychiatric services, humanistic care ability significantly affects the quality of the therapeutic relationship and thus affects the therapeutic outcomes for patients. Mental health workers may be confronted with more obstacles in humanistic care during the COVID-19 pandemic wherethe authors aimed to explore the capacity level of humanistic care among mental health workers and its potential influencing factors.An online cross-sectional survey was conducted among 262 mental health workers working in Chongqing, China, from December 2020 to January 2021. Data were collected by the Caring Ability Inventory (CAI), the Psychological Capital Questionnaire (PCQ-24), the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire-Revised, and the Short Scale for Chinese (EPQ-RSC). Multiple linear regression analysis was used to explore the influencing factors of humanistic care ability.Mental health workers' humanistic care ability is at a low level, with a score of 186.47 ± 21.34. Psychological capital is positively associated with humanistic care ability (β[95%CI] = 0.41 [0.46-0.77], p < 0.001), and its two dimensions (cognition: β[95%CI] = 0.51 [0.30-0.47], p < 0.001; patience: β[95%CI] = 0.48 [0.17-0.28], p < 0.001). Psychoticism is negatively associated with humanistic care ability (β[95%CI] = -0.28 [-5.18 - -2.51], p < 0.001) and its three dimensions (cognition: β[95%CI] = -0.12 [-1.57 - -0.17], p < 0.05; courage: β[95%CI] = -0.17 [-1.7 - -0.32], p < 0.01; patience: β[95%CI] = -0.19 [-1.33 - -0.36], p < 0.01). Extroversion is positively associated with humanistic care ability (β[95%CI] = 0.19 [0.69-2.08], p < 0.001), and its two dimensions (cognition: β[95%CI] = 0.19 [0.32-1.05], p < 0.001; courage: β[95%CI] = 0.27 [0.5-1.23], p < 0.001). Neuroticism is negatively associated with humanistic care ability (β[95%CI] = -0.13[-1.37 - -0.19], p < 0.01) and its one dimension (courage: β[95%CI] = -0.25 [-0.98 - -0.35], p < 0.001).The research has found that the humanistic care ability of mental health workers is at a low level, and the psychological capital and personality traits are significant factors influencing the humanistic care ability and its sub-dimensions. Interventions to improve the psychological capital of mental health workers or to promote the change of personality traits they want are recommended, thereby to promote humanistic practice.","['COVID19', 'Cognition', 'Courage', 'Healthcare workers', 'Personality', 'Psychological capital']"
Astigmatism induced by conventional spherical ablation after PRK and LASIK in myopia with astigmatism < 1.00 D.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate surgically-induced astigmatism after spherical ablation in photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) and laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) for myopia with astigmatism < 1.00 D.The charts of patients undergoing spherical PRK or LASIK for the correction of myopia with minimal astigmatism of <1.00 D from 2002 to 2012 at the John A Moran Eye Center in Salt Lake City, UT, were retrospectively reviewed. Astigmatism was measured by manifest refraction. The final astigmatic refractive outcome at 6 months postoperatively was compared with the initial refraction by Alpins vector analysis.For PRK, average cylinder increased from 0.39 ± 0.25 (0.00-0.75) preoperatively to 0.55 ± 0.48 (0.00-1.75) postoperatively (P = 0.014), compared with an increase in LASIK eyes from 0.40 ± 0.27 (0.00-0.75) preoperatively to 0.52 ± 0.45 (0.00-2.00) postoperatively (P = 0.041). PRK eyes experienced an absolute value change in cylinder of 0.41 ± 0.32 (0.00-1.50) and LASIK eyes experienced a change of 0.41 ± 0.31 (0.00-1.50, P = 0.955). Mean surgically-induced astigmatism was 0.59 ± 0.35 (0.00-1.70) in PRK eyes, with an increase in surgically-induced astigmatism of 0.44 D for each additional 1.00 D of preoperative cylinder; in LASIK eyes, mean surgically-induced astigmatism was 0.55 ± 0.32 (0.00-1.80, P = 0.482), with an increase in surgically-induced astigmatism of 0.29 D for each 1.00 D of preoperative cylinder.Spherical ablation can induce substantial astigmatism even in eyes with less than one diopter of preoperative astigmatism in both PRK and LASIK. No significant difference in the magnitude of surgically-induced astigmatism was found between eyes treated with PRK and LASIK, although surgically-induced astigmatism was found to increase with greater levels of preoperative astigmatism in both PRK and LASIK.","['ablation', 'laserassisted in situ keratomileusis', 'photorefractive keratectomy', 'surgicallyinduced astigmatism']"
White Matter Correlates of Auditory Comprehension Outcomes in Chronic Post-Stroke Aphasia.,"Neuroimaging studies have shown that speech comprehension involves a number of widely distributed regions within the frontal and temporal lobes. We aimed to examine the differential contributions of white matter connectivity to auditory word and sentence comprehension in chronic post-stroke aphasia. Structural and diffusion MRI data were acquired on 40 patients with chronic post-stroke aphasia. A battery of auditory word and sentence comprehension tests were administered to all the patients. Tract-based spatial statistics were used to identify areas in which white matter integrity related to specific comprehension deficits. Relevant tracts were reconstructed using probabilistic tractography in healthy older participants, and the mean values of fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AD), and radial diffusivity (RD) of the entire tracts were examined in relation to comprehension scores. Anterior temporal white matter integrity loss and involvement of the uncinate fasciculus related to word-level comprehension deficits (<i>R</i><sub>FA</sub> = 0.408, <i>P</i> = 0.012; <i>R</i><sub>MD</sub> = -0.429, <i>P</i> = 0.008; <i>R</i><sub>AD</sub> = -0.424, <i>P</i> = 0.009; <i>R</i><sub>RD</sub> = -0.439, <i>P</i> = 0.007). Posterior temporal white matter integrity loss and involvement of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus related to sentence-level comprehension deficits (<i>R</i><sub>FA</sub> = 0.382, <i>P</i> = 0.02; <i>R</i><sub>MD</sub> = -0.461, <i>P</i> = 0.004; <i>R</i><sub>AD</sub> = -0.457, <i>P</i> = 0.004; <i>R</i><sub>RD</sub> = -0.453, <i>P</i> = 0.005). Loss of white matter integrity in the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus related to both word- and sentence-level comprehension (word-level scores: <i>R</i><sub>FA</sub> = 0.41, <i>P</i> = 0.012; <i>R</i><sub>MD</sub> = -0.447, <i>P</i> = 0.006; <i>R</i><sub>AD</sub> = -0.489, <i>P</i> = 0.002; <i>R</i><sub>RD</sub> = -0.432, <i>P</i> = 0.008; sentence-level scores: <i>R</i><sub>FA</sub> = 0.409, <i>P</i> = 0.012; <i>R</i><sub>MD</sub> = -0.413, <i>P</i> = 0.011; <i>R</i><sub>AD</sub> = -0.408, <i>P</i> = 0.012; <i>R</i><sub>RD</sub> = -0.413, <i>P</i> = 0.011). Lesion overlap, but not white matter integrity, in the arcuate fasciculus related to sentence-level comprehension deficits. These findings suggest that word-level comprehension outcomes in chronic post-stroke aphasia rely primarily on anterior temporal lobe pathways, whereas sentence-level comprehension relies on more widespread pathways including the posterior temporal lobe.","['aphasia', 'diffusion tensor imaging', 'outcome', 'stroke', 'white matter']"
Percutaneous endovenous intervention versus anticoagulation in the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) of the lower extremity (LE) might lead to pulmonary embolism (PE) and post-thrombolytic syndrome (PTS). Recently, percutaneous endovenous intervention (PEVI) has been advocated for early removal of thrombus clot and restoration of venous patency. This study aims to review the safety and efficacy outcomes of PEVI versus anticoagulation in the treatment of acute LE-DVT.We searched the databases of PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) and/or pharmacomechanical thrombectomy (PMT) versus anticoagulation for acute proximal LE-DVT, published before August 2022. Efficacy outcomes were PTS and venous patency. Safety outcomes included recurrent thromboembolism, bleeding complications, and PE.Overall, 1,266 patients were included from 6 RCTs. The overall risk of bias was small due to enrolled high-quality RCTs. Compared to anticoagulation, PEVI moderately reduced PTS incidence [odds ratio (OR) 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.23-0.99], obviously inhibited moderate-to-severe PTS (OR 0.60, 95% CI: 0.40-0.88), significantly decreased PE (OR 0.16, 95% CI: 0.05-0.48), and substantially increased venous patency (OR 7.95, 95% CI: 1.00-63.16). There was no significant difference in recurrent thromboembolism between PEVI and anticoagulation (OR 0.76, 95% CI: 0.34-1.73). Bleeding events did not differ statistically between PEVI and anticoagulation (OR 1.36, 95% CI: 0.87-2.11). We conducted single-arm meta-analysis of the PEVI or anticoagulation. Pooled proportion of PTS was less after PEVI (0.295, 95% CI: 0.123-0.505) than after anticoagulation (0.459, 95% CI: 0.306-0.616). Pooled proportion of moderate-to-severe PTS was lower after PEVI (0.098, 95% CI: 0.033-0.191) than after anticoagulation (0.183, 95% CI: 0.126-0.247). Pooled proportion of PE was smaller after PEVI (0.006, 95% CI: 0.00-0.020) as compared to anticoagulation (0.075, 95% CI: 0.038-0.122). Pooled proportion of recurrent thromboembolism was similar between PEVI (0.095, 95% CI: 0.054-0.146) and anticoagulation (0.124, 95% CI: 0.061-0.206). Pooled proportion of bleeding was not different statistically between PEVI (0.026, 95% CI: 0.00-0.131) and anticoagulation (0.008, 95% CI: 0.00-0.094).PEVI, consisting of PMT and/or CDT, is an extremely effective and feasible approach for patients with acute LE-DVT. In comparison to therapeutic anticoagulation, PEVI restores venous patency, inhibits the PTS development, reduces the PE occurrence, does not markedly increase the bleeding risk, but does not reduce recurrent thromboembolism.","['Deep vein thrombosis DVT', 'anticoagulation', 'catheterdirected thrombolysis CDT', 'percutaneous endovenous intervention PEVI', 'pharmacomechanical thrombolysis PMT']"
Cross-sectional associations between cardiorespiratory fitness and NMR-derived metabolic biomarkers in children - the PANIC study.,"Cardiorespiratory fitness has been inversely associated with cardiovascular risk across the lifespan. Some studies in adults suggest that higher cardiorespiratory fitness is associated with cardioprotective metabolite profile, but the evidence in children is lacking. Therefore, we investigated the cross-sectional association of cardiorespiratory fitness with serum nuclear magnetic resonance derived metabolic biomarkers in children.A population sample of 450 children aged 6-8 years was examined. Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by a maximal exercise test on a cycle ergometer and quantified as maximal power output normalised for lean body mass assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorbtiometry. Serum metabolites were assessed using a high throughput nuclear magnetic resonance platform. The data were analysed using linear regression analyses adjusted for age and sex and subsequently for body fat percentage (BF%) assessed by DXA.Cardiorespiratory fitness was directly associated with high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (β=0.138, 95% CI=0.042 to 0.135, p=0.005), average HDL particle diameter (β=0.102, 95% CI=0.004 to 0.199, p=0.041), and the concentrations of extra-large HDL particles (β=0.103, 95% CI=0.006 to 0.201, p=0.038), large HDL particles (β=0.122, 95% CI=0.025 to 0.220, p=0.014), and medium HDL particles (β=0.143, 95% CI=0.047 to 0.239, p=0.004) after adjustment for age and sex. Higher cardiorespiratory fitness was also associated with higher concentrations of ApoA1 (β=0.145, 95% CI=0.047 to 0.242, p=0.003), glutamine (β=0.161, 95% CI=0.064 to 0.257, p=0.001), and phenylalanine (β=0.187, 95% CI=0.091 to 0.283, p<0.001). However, only the direct associations of cardiorespiratory fitness with the concentrations of HDL cholesterol (β=0.114, 95% CI=0.018 to 0.210, p=0.021), medium HDL particles (β=0.126, 95% CI=0.030 to 0.223, p=0.010), ApoA1 (β=0.126, 95% CI=0.030 to 0.223, p=0.011), glutamine (β=0.147, 95% CI=0.050 to 0.224, p=0.003), and phenylalanine (β=0.217, 95% CI=0.122 to 0.311, p<0.001) remained statistically significant after further adjustment for BF%.Higher cardiorespiratory fitness was associated with a cardioprotective biomarker profile in children. Most associations were independent of BF% suggesting that the differences in serum metabolites between children are driven by cardiorespiratory fitness and not adiposity.","['aerobic fitness', 'fitness', 'lipoproteins', 'metabolism', 'metabolomics', 'obesity', 'pediatrics']"
Automatic Lung Segmentation and Quantification of Aeration in Computed Tomography of the Chest Using 3D Transfer Learning.,"Identification of lung parenchyma on computer tomographic (CT) scans in the research setting is done semi-automatically and requires cumbersome manual correction. This is especially true in pathological conditions, hindering the clinical application of aeration compartment (AC) analysis. Deep learning based algorithms have lately been shown to be reliable and time-efficient in segmenting pathologic lungs. In this contribution, we thus propose a novel 3D transfer learning based approach to quantify lung volumes, aeration compartments and lung recruitability.Two convolutional neural networks developed for biomedical image segmentation (uNet), with different resolutions and fields of view, were implemented using Matlab. Training and evaluation was done on 180 scans of 18 pigs in experimental ARDS (<i>u</i>2<i>Net</i> <sub><i>Pig</i></sub> ) and on a clinical data set of 150 scans from 58 ICU patients with lung conditions varying from healthy, to COPD, to ARDS and COVID-19 (<i>u</i>2<i>Net</i> <sub><i>Human</i></sub> ). One manual segmentations (MS) was available for each scan, being a consensus by two experts. Transfer learning was then applied to train <i>u</i>2<i>Net</i> <sub><i>Pig</i></sub> on the clinical data set generating <i>u</i>2<i>Net</i> <sub><i>Transfer</i></sub> . General segmentation quality was quantified using the Jaccard index (<i>JI</i>) and the Boundary Function score (<i>BF</i>). The slope between <i>JI</i> or <i>BF</i> and relative volume of non-aerated compartment (<i>S</i> <sub><i>JI</i></sub> and <i>S</i> <sub><i>BF</i></sub> , respectively) was calculated over data sets to assess robustness toward non-aerated lung regions. Additionally, the relative volume of ACs and lung volumes (LV) were compared between automatic and MS.On the experimental data set, <i>u</i>2<i>Net</i> <sub><i>Pig</i></sub> resulted in <i>JI</i> = 0.892 [0.88 : 091] (median [inter-quartile range]), <i>BF</i> = 0.995 [0.98 : 1.0] and slopes <i>S</i> <sub><i>JI</i></sub> = -0.2 {95% conf. int. -0.23 : -0.16} and <i>S</i> <sub><i>BF</i></sub> = -0.1 {-0.5 : -0.06}. <i>u</i>2<i>Net</i> <sub><i>Human</i></sub> showed similar performance compared to <i>u</i>2<i>Net</i> <sub><i>Pig</i></sub> in <i>JI</i>, <i>BF</i> but with reduced robustness <i>S</i> <sub><i>JI</i></sub> = -0.29 {-0.36 : -0.22} and <i>S</i> <sub><i>BF</i></sub> = -0.43 {-0.54 : -0.31}. Transfer learning improved overall <i>JI</i> = 0.92 [0.88 : 0.94], <i>P</i> < 0.001, but reduced robustness <i>S</i> <sub><i>JI</i></sub> = -0.46 {-0.52 : -0.40}, and affected neither <i>BF</i> = 0.96 [0.91 : 0.98] nor <i>S</i> <sub><i>BF</i></sub> = -0.48 {-0.59 : -0.36}. <i>u</i>2<i>Net</i> <sub><i>Transfer</i></sub> improved <i>JI</i> compared to <i>u</i>2<i>Net</i> <sub><i>Human</i></sub> in segmenting healthy (<i>P</i> = 0.008), ARDS (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and COPD (<i>P</i> = 0.004) patients but not in COVID-19 patients (<i>P</i> = 0.298). ACs and LV determined using <i>u</i>2<i>Net</i> <sub><i>Transfer</i></sub> segmentations exhibited < 5% volume difference compared to MS.Compared to manual segmentations, automatic uNet based 3D lung segmentation provides acceptable quality for both clinical and scientific purposes in the quantification of lung volumes, aeration compartments, and recruitability.","['ARDS', 'COVID19', 'Jaccard index', 'deep learning', 'lung recruitment', 'lung segmentation', 'transfer learning', 'uNet']"
Study of Simplified Coma Scales: Acute Stroke Patients with Tracheal Intubation.,"Whether the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) can assess intubated patients is still a topic of controversy. We compared the test performance of the GCS motor component (GCS-M)/Simplified Motor Score (SMS) to the total of the GCS in predicting the outcomes of intubated acute severe cerebral vascular disease patients.A retrospective analysis of prospectively collected observational data was performed. Between January 2012 and October 2015, 106 consecutive acute severe cerebral vascular disease patients with intubation were included in the study. GCS, GCS-M, GCS eye-opening component, and SMS were documented on admission and at 24, 48, and 72 h after admission to Neurointensive Care Unit (NCU). Outcomes were death and unfavorable prognosis (modified Rankin Scale: 5-6) at NCU discharge. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was obtained to determine the prognostic performance and best cutoff value for each scoring system. Comparison of the area under the ROC curves (AUCs) was performed using the Z- test.Of 106 patients included in the study, 41 (38.7%) patients died, and 69 (65.1%) patients had poor prognosis when discharged from NCU. The four time points within 72 h of admission to the NCU were equivalent for each scale's predictive power, except that 0 h was the best for each scale in predicting outcomes of patients with right-hemisphere lesions. Nonsignificant difference was found between GCS-M AUCs and GCS AUCs in predicting death at 0 h (0.721 vs. 0.717, Z = 0.135, P = 0.893) and 72 h (0.730 vs. 0.765, Z = 1.887, P = 0.060), in predicting poor prognosis at 0 h (0.827 vs. 0.819, Z = 0.395, P = 0.693), 24 h (0.771 vs. 0.760, Z = 0.944, P = 0.345), 48 h (0.732 vs. 0.741, Z = 0.593, P = 0.590), and 72 h (0.775 vs. 0.780, Z = 0.302, P = 0.763). AUCs in predicting death for patients with left-hemisphere lesions ranged from 0.700 to 0.804 for GCS-M and from 0.700 to 0.824 for GCS, in predicting poor prognosis ranged from 0.841 to 0.969 for GCS-M and from 0.875 to 0.969 for GCS, with no significant difference between GCS-M AUCs and GCS AUCs within 72 h (P > 0.05). No significant difference between GCS-M AUCs and GCS AUCs was found in predicting death (0.964 vs. 0.964, P = 1.000) and poor prognosis (1.000 vs. 1.000, P = 1.000) for patients with right-hemisphere lesions at 0 h. AUCs in predicting death for patients with brainstem or cerebella were poor for GCS-M (<0.700), in predicting poor prognosis ranged from 0.727 to 0.801 for GCS-M and from 0.704 to 0.820 for GCS, with no significant difference between GCS-M AUCs and GCS AUCs within 72 h (P > 0.05). The SMS AUCs (<0.700) in predicting outcomes were poor.The GCS-M approaches the same test performance as the GCS in assessing the prognosis of intubated acute severe cerebral vascular disease patients. The GCS-M could be accurately and reliably applied in patients with hemisphere lesions, but caution must be taken for patients with brainstem or cerebella lesions.","['Coma Scale', 'Consciousness Disorders', 'Intubation', 'Prognosis']"
Determinants of health-related quality-of-life in adult survivors of childhood cancer: integrating personal and societal values through a health utility approach.,"Childhood cancer survivors are at elevated risk for poor health-related quality-of-life (HRQOL). Identification of potentially modifiable risk factors associated with HRQOL is needed to inform survivorship care.Participants included 4294 adult childhood cancer survivors from the St. Jude Lifetime Cohort Study who completed a survey and clinical assessment at entry into the survivorship cohort (baseline) and follow-up (median interval: 4.3 years) between 2007 and 2019. The SF-6D compared utility-based HRQOL of survivors to an independent sample from the U.S. Medical Expenditures Panel Survey. Chronic health conditions (CHCs) were graded using modified Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events. General linear models examined cross-sectional and temporal associations of HRQOL with CHC burden (total and by organ-system), adjusting for potential risk factors.Survivors reported poorer HRQOL compared to the general population (effect size [d] = -0.343). In cross-sectional analyses at baseline, significant non-demographic risk factors included higher total CHC burden (driven by more severe cardiovascular [d = -0.119, p = 0.002], endocrine [d = -0.112, p = 0.001], gastrointestinal [d = -0.226, p < 0.001], immunologic [d = -0.168, p = 0.035], neurologic [d = -0.388, p < 0.001], pulmonary [d = -0.132, p = 0.003] CHCs), public (d = -0.503, p < 0.001) or no health insurance (d = -0.123, p = 0.007), current smoking (d = -0.270, p < 0.001), being physically inactive (d = -0.129, p < 0.001), ever using illicit drugs (d = -0.235, p < 0.001), and worse diet quality (d = -0.004, p = 0.016). In temporal analyses, poorer utility-based HRQOL at follow-up was associated with risk factors at baseline, including higher total CHC burden (driven by cardiovascular [d = -0.152, p = 0.002], endocrine [d = -0.092, p = 0.047], musculoskeletal [d = -0.160, p = 0.016], neurologic [d = -0.318, p < 0.001] CHCs), public (d = -0.415, p < 0.001) or no health insurance (d = -0.161, p = 0.007), current smoking (d = -0.218, p = 0.001), and ever using illicit drugs (d = -0.217, p < 0.001).Adult survivors report worse utility-based HRQOL than the general population, and potentially modifiable risk factors were associated with HRQOL. Interventions to prevent the early onset of CHCs, promote healthy lifestyle, and ensure access to health insurance in the early survivorship stage may provide opportunities to improve HRQOL.The research reported in this manuscript was supported by the U.S. National Cancer Institute under award numbers U01CA195547 (Hudson/Ness), R01CA238368 (Huang/Baker), R01CA258193 (Huang/Yasui), R01CA270157 (Bhakta/Yasui), and T32CA225590 (Krull).

Efficacy and Safety of Tongxinluo Capsule as Adjunctive Treatment for Unstable Angina Pectoris: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Tongxinluo capsule (TXLC) is a commonly used Chinese medicine for unstable angina pectoris (UA). This article aimed to clarify the safety and efficacy of TXLC as an adjunctive treatment for UA. Two reviewers searched 7 databases from inception to August 2021, and performed literature screening and information extraction independently. The meta-analysis was implemented after evaluating the methodological quality of each randomized controlled trial (RCT) by the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Sensitivity analyses were conducted for testing the stability of the results, and the Begg and Egger tests were performed for any potential publication bias. After eligibility assessment, 42 RCTs with a total of 5,421 participants were included. Evidence showed that TXLC reduced the rate of cardiovascular events [RR = 0.29, 95% CI (0.19, 0.45), <i>p</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 0%] {including cardiovascular mortality [RR = 0.16, 95% CI (0.03, 0.88), <i>p</i> = 0.03, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 20%], the incidence of acute myocardial infarction [RR = 0.27, 95% CI (0.13, 0.57), <i>p</i> = 0.0006, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 0%] and the occurrence of revascularization [RR = 0.28, 95% CI (0.15,0.54), <i>p</i> = 0.0001, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 0%]}, all-cause mortality [RR = 0.25, 95% CI (0.06, 0.99), <i>p =</i> 0.05, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 19%], recurrence of angina [RR = 0.25, 95% CI (0.11, 0.61), <i>p =</i> 0.002, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%], the number of ST-segment depression [MD = -0.45, 95% CI (-0.69, -0.20), <i>p =</i> 0.0005, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%], the summation of ST-segment depression [MD = -0.70, 95% CI (-1.08, -0.32), <i>p =</i> 0.0003, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 70%] and the hypersensitive C-reactive protein level [MD = -2.86, 95% CI (-3.73, -1.99), <i>p</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 86%], increased the nitric oxide level [MD = 11.67, 95% CI (8.33, 15.02), <i>p</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 33%], improved the electrocardiogram change [RR = 1.23, 95% CI (1.16, 1.30), <i>p</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%] and the clinical efficacy in UA [RR = 1.26, 95% CI (1.21, 1.32), <i>p</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 24%], and relieved the symptoms of angina pectoris {including chest pain or tightness [RR = 1.13, 95% CI (0.97, 1.32), <i>p</i> = 0.12, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 30%], palpitations [RR = 1.47, 95% CI (1.18, 1.84), <i>p</i> = 0.0007, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%], shortness of breath [RR = 1.53, 95% CI (1.24, 1.88), <i>p</i> < 0.0001, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%], and asthenia [RR = 1.69, 95% CI (0.83, 3.43), <i>p</i> = 0.15, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 90%]}. The most common adverse effect was gastrointestinal symptoms which could be relieved and eliminated through dose reduction, medication time adjustment and symptomatic remedy. Collectively, TXLC was effective and considerably safe for UA.

The effect of aerobic exercise on pulse wave velocity in middle-aged and elderly people: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"A growing body of research examines the effect of aerobic exercise on pulse wave velocity (PWV) in middle-aged and elderly people, while findings of available studies were conflicting. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of aerobic exercise on PWV in middle-aged and elderly people. Searches were performed in PubMed, Web of Science, and EBSCO databases. Cochrane risk assessment tool was used to evaluate the methodological quality of the included literature. We included studies that satisfied the following criteria: (1) eligible studies should be randomized controlled trials (RCTs); (2) eligible studies should include both an intervention and a control group; (3) eligible studies should use the middle-aged or elderly people as subjects; and (4) eligible studies should use PWV as the outcome measure. From 972 search records initially identified, 11 studies with a total of 12 exercise groups (<i>n</i> = 245) and 11 control groups (<i>n</i> = 239) were eligible for meta-analysis. There was a significant effect of aerobic exercise on reducing PWV in middle-aged and elderly people [weighted mean difference (WMD), -0.75 (95% CI, -1.21 to -0.28), <i>p</i> = 0.002]. Specifically, a higher intensity [vigorous-intensity, -0.74 (-1.34 to -0.14), <i>p</i> = 0.02; moderate-intensity, -0.68 (-1.49 to 0.12), <i>p</i> = 0.10], a younger age [45 years ≤ age < 60 years, -0.57 (-0.78 to -0.37), <i>p</i> < 0.00001; age ≥ 60 years, -0.91 (-2.10 to 0.27), <i>p</i> = 0.13], a better health status [healthy, -1.19 (-2.06 to -0.31), <i>p</i> = 0.008; diseased, -0.32 (-0.64 to -0.01), <i>p</i> = 0.04], and a lower basal body mass index (BMI) [BMI < 25, -1.19 (-2.06 to -0.31), <i>p</i> = 0.008; 25 ≤ BMI < 30, -0.52 (-0.92 to -0.12), <i>p</i> = 0.01; BMI ≥ 30, -0.09 (-0.93 to 0.76), <i>p</i> = 0.84] were associatedwith larger reductions in PWV. Aerobic exercise, especially vigorous-intensity aerobic exercise, contributed to reducing PWV in middle-aged and elderly people. The effect of aerobic exercise on improving PWV was associated with characteristics of the participants. Specifically, a younger age, a better health status, and a lower basal BMI contributed to more significant reductions in PWV.[https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42022337103], identifier [CRD42022337103].","['aerobic exercise', 'arterial stiffness', 'elderly people', 'middleaged people', 'pulse wave velocity']"
Meta-analysis of brain metabolite differences in HIV infection.,"Numerous studies have used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) neurometabolite measurements to study HIV infection effects. While many have reported differences in total N-Acetylaspartate (tNAA), myo-Inositol (mI), and total Choline (tCho), there have been no meta-analyses performed to evaluate concordance across studies.To evaluate the consistency of HIV serostatus effects on brain metabolites.The sample included studies conducted between 1993 and 2019 reporting HIV infection effects measured using proton MRS. tNAA/tCr ratios (21 papers), tCho/tCr ratios (21 papers), mI/tCr ratios (17 papers) and quantitative tCr (9 papers), sampling from basal ganglia (BG), gray matter (GM), and white matter (WM) were included.Random effects meta-analysis using inverse variance weighting and bias corrected standardized mean differences (SMDs) was used. Meta-regression examined effects of publication year and data acquisition technique differences.BG SMDs related to positive serostatus were -0.10 [-0.39; 0.18] tNAA/tCr, 0.27 [0.05; 0.49] tCho/tCr, 0.60 [0.31; 0.90] mI/tCr, and -0.26 [-0.59; 0.06] tCr. GM SMDs related to serostatus were -0.29 [-0.49; -0.09] tNAA/tCr, 0.37 [0.19; 0.54] tCho/tCr, 0.41 [0.15; 0.68] mI/tCr, and -0.24 [-0.45; -0.03] tCr. WM SMDs related to serostatus were -0.52 [-0.79; -0.25] tNAA/tCr, 0.41 [0.21; 0.61] tCho/tCr, 0.59 [0.24; 0.94] mI/tCr, and -0.03 [-0.25; 0.19] tCr. WM regions showed larger serostatus effect sizes than BG and GM. I<sup>2</sup> ranged from 52 to 88% for the metabolite ratios. Both GM and WM tNAA/tCr SMDs were lower with increasing calendar year.Many studies pooled participants with varying treatment, infection, and comorbidity durations.HIV neurometabolite studies showed consistently lower tNAA/tCr, higher tCho/tCr and higher mI/tCr ratios associated with chronic HIV infection. Substantial between-study variation may have resulted from measurement technique variations, study population differences and HIV treatment changes over time. Higher WM tCho/tCr and mI/tCr may reflect reactive gliosis or myelin turnover. Neurometabolite measurements can reliably detect chronic HIV infection effects and may be useful in understanding the pathophysiology of cognitive and sensorimotor decline following HIV infection.This study provides Class II evidence of neurometabolite differences in chronic HIV infection.","['ART', 'Antiretroviral therapy', 'HAND', 'HIV associated neurocognitive disorder', 'Inflammation', 'MRS', 'Magnetic resonance spectroscopy', 'Neurons']"
Smartphone-enabled retinal arteriovenous imaging and correlation with coronary SYNTAX score.,"To assess the feasibility of measurement of retinal arteriovenous (AV) ratio using a smartphone, we performed a comparative evaluation with fundus camera imaging and coronary SYNTAX score.Successive coronary artery disease (CAD) patients who underwent coronary angiography were recruited for smartphone retinal imaging. Following pupillary dilatation, fundus camera images and smartphone photography were performed. Video images were captured with a smartphone, edited and analysed. Retinal artery and vein size at 0.5 and 1 disc diameter (DD) were measured using DICOM software by two independent observers. Another observer calculated SYNTAX score.Analysable smartphone images were available in 91 (89.2%) of 102 patients. Tobacco use was found in 26%, hypertension in 54%, diabetes in 55%, and high LDL cholesterol in 50%. Median and 25-75 interquartile range (IQR) AV ratio at 0.5 and 1.0 DD, respectively, with smartphone were 0.48 (0.45-0.52) and 0.47 (0.45-0.52) and fundus camera were 0.48 (0.44-0.53) and 0.48 (0.45-0.53) (Spearman's correlation 0.80 and 0.79, p < 0.001). Coronary single vessel disease was in 21%, double vessel in 16%, triple vessel in 55%, normal angiogram in 8%, and median SYNTAX score was 18.0 (8.0-25.0). There was an inverse correlation of SYNTAX score with smartphone-derived AV ratio at 0.5 and 1.0 DD (rho -0.27,p = 0.007 and -0.26,p = 0.009) as well as with fundus camera (rho -0.37 and -0.38, p < 0.001). Trend-analysis showed an inverse association of smartphone AV ratio with increasing CAD (p<sub>trend</sub> <0.001).Smartphone-based retinal AV imaging is feasible and comparable to fundus-camera imaging. There is a significant inverse correlation with coronary angiographic severity.","['Coronary artery disease', 'Health technology', 'Mobile phone', 'Retinal arteriovenous ratio', 'Risk assessment', 'SYNTAX score']"
Predictors of non-adherence to medication and time to default from treatment on HIV infected patients under HAART: a comparison of joint and separate models.,"Ethiopia is one of the Sub-Saharan Africa with the highest number of people living with HIV. Amhara region is one of the regions in the country in which many people are under medication. The main objective of this research was to identify significant predictors of non-adherence to medication and time to default from treatment for HIV infected patients under HAART.A retrospective secondary data were obtained from a random sample of 220 HIV patients under HAART. Separate and joint modeling approaches were conducted in data analysis. Joint modeling was conducted for analysis of non-adherence to medication and the time to default from treatment. In the joint model, a GLMM and Cox PH sub-models were fit together for non-adherence to medication and time to default from treatment.The significant predictors for the variables of interests in current investigation were length of visiting time(AOR of 95% CI=0.866 (0.752, 0.997), female patients(AOR of 95% CI= 0.219 (0.067, 0.717)), patients disclosed the disease(AOR of 95% CI= 0.353 (0.194,0.641)), patients who got social support(AOR of 95% CI= 0.252 (0.194,0.631)), patients living with parter(AOR of 95% CI=0.188 (0.042,0.844)), patients with owner of cell phone(AOR of 95%CI= 0.272 (0.081,0.916)), urban HIV patients(AOR of 94%CI= 0.238 (0.078,0.722)), patients with working functional status(AOR of 95% CI= 0.234 (0.079,0.692)), patients with normal BMI(AOR of 95% CI=0.921 (0.881, 0.963)), patients with high baseline CD4 cell count(AOR of 95% CI=0.873 (0.552, 0.997)).Some groups of HIV patients were non-adherent to medication and defaulted from treatment. Health related education is recommended for non-adherent patients to be adherent for the prescribed medication and live long in the treatment.","['HAART', 'Nonadherence', 'joint model', 'separate model', 'time to default']"
Association Between HDL-C and Bone Mineral Density: An Cross-Sectional Analysis.,"Dyslipidemia has been found to contribute to increased risk of osteoporosis and its association with bone mineral density (BMD) remains controversial. We determined whether blood lipid levels are linked with change of BMD.In a large sample from the MIDUS II study, we sought to evaluate the relationship between blood lipid levels and BMD. Multivariate linear regression models and smooth curve analysis were constructed by controlling a great range of confounding factors.The median age of them was 52.5 years, and the number of males was 176 (40%). Univariate analysis showed that blood high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) level was negatively related to lunar total femur (r = -0.266, P < 0.001), lunar radius ultradistal (UD) (r = -0.297, P < 0.001), lunar radius 1/3 (r = -0.307, P = 0.001) and femoral neck (r = -0.172, P = 0.001). In multivariate linear analysis, except for blood triglyceride, total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), we found that blood HDL-C level was still negatively related to lunar total femur [B = -0.002, B 95% CI (-0.002, -0.001), P < 0.001], lunar radius UD [B = -0.001, 95% CI (-0.001, 0), P = 0.002], lunar radius 1/3 [B = -0.001, 95% CI (-0.001, 0), P = 0.003] and femoral neck [B = -0.001, 95% CI (-0.002, 0), P = 0.039] after adjustments of demographic characteristics, lifestyle, disease history were made. Furthermore, we found that age, sex, and body mass index (BMI) had modifying effects on this negative association.This study confirmed the negative association between HDL-C and BMD in the observational analysis from (MIDUS) study and provides high-quality evidence that age, sex and BMI had modifying effects on this negative association.","['MIDUS II study', 'blood lipid', 'bone mineral density', 'osteoporosis']"
Associations with four generations of divergent selection for age at puberty in swine.,"The objective was to evaluate 4 generations of divergent selection for age at puberty (young age at puberty = YOUNG; old age at puberty = OLD) in swine. Composite Landrace × Large White animals (n = 4,941) were reared at the North Carolina Department of Agriculture Tidewater Research Station. At 130 d of age, gilts were exposed to mature boars for 7 min daily. Estrous detection continued for 90 d. Puberty was defined as first observed standing reflex in the presence of a boar. Reproductive and performance traits included: age at puberty (AGEPUB), probability of a gilt reaching puberty by 220 d of age (PUB), puberty weight (PUBWT), pubertal estrus (LEN1), length of second estrus (LEN2), vulva width at puberty (VW1), vulva width at second estrus (VW2), gilt birth weight (BWT), gilt weaning weight (WWT), loin eye area (LEA), backfat depth (BF), and weight (WT178) were measured at 178 d of age on average. Variance components were estimated utilizing an animal model in ASReml 4.1. Models included fixed effects of generation and sex, a random common litter effect, and a random animal genetic effect. Covariates were fit for reproductive traits (age at boar exposure), LEA and BF (WT178) and WT178 (age weighed). In generation 4, YOUNG and OLD gilts had on average a PUB of 87% and 64%, respectively, and AGEPUB of 163 and 183 d, respectively. Heritability estimates for AGEPUB, PUB, PUBWT, LEN1, LEN2, VW1, VW2, BWT, WWT, LEA, BF, and WT178 were 0.40, 0.07, 0.39, 0.19, 0.17, 0.36, 0.48, 0.20, 0.12, 0.42, 0.43, and 0.37, respectively. Common litter effect estimates for AGEPUB, PUB, PUBWT, LEN1, LEN2, VW1, VW2, BWT, WWT, LEA, BF, and WT178 were 0.08, 0.14, 0.03, 0.00, 0.01, 0.05, 0.00, 0.03, 0.29, 0.02, 0.10, and 0.11, respectively. Genetic correlations between AGEPUB with PUBWT, LEN1, LEN2, VW1, VW2, BWT, WWT, LEA, BF, and WT178 were 0.83, -0.22, -0.31, 0.25, 0.19, -0.08, -0.29, 0.15, -0.21, and -0.43, respectively. Results suggest selection for reduced AGEPUB in swine would decrease AGEPUB and increase PUB.","['age at puberty', 'genetic parameters', 'swine']"

Heart rate variability status at rest in adult depressed patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"A meta-analysis was conducted to examine the differences in heart rate variability (HRV) between depressed patients and healthy individuals, with the purpose of providing a theoretical basis for the diagnosis of depression and the prevention of cardiovascular diseases.To search China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), WanFang, VIP, PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Cochrane Library databases to collect case-control studies on HRV in depressed patients, the retrieval date is from the establishment of the database to December 2022. Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) scale was used to evaluate literature quality, and Stata14.0 software was used for meta-analysis.This study comprised of 43 papers, 22 written in Chinese and 21 in English, that included 2,359 subjects in the depression group and 3,547 in the healthy control group. Meta-analysis results showed that compared with the healthy control group, patients with depression had lower SDNN [<i>Hedges' g</i> = -0.87, <i>95% CI</i> (-1.14, -0.60), <i>Z</i> = -6.254, <i>p</i> < 0.01], RMSSD [<i>Hedges' g</i> = -0.51, <i>95% CI</i> (-0.69,-0.33), <i>Z</i> = -5.525, <i>p</i> < 0.01], PNN50 [<i>Hedges' g</i> = -0.43, <i>95% CI</i> (-0.59, -0.27), <i>Z</i> = -5.245, <i>p</i> < 0.01], LF [<i>Hedges' g</i> = -0.34, <i>95% CI</i> (-0.55, - 0.13), <i>Z</i> = -3.104, <i>p</i> < 0.01], and HF [<i>Hedges' g</i> = -0.51, <i>95% CI</i> (-0.69, -0.33), <i>Z</i> = -5.669 <i>p</i> < 0.01], and LF/HF [<i>Hedges' g</i> = -0.05, <i>95% CI</i> (-0.27, 0.18), <i>Z</i> = -0.410, <i>p</i> = 0.682] showed no significant difference.This research revealed that HRV measures of depressed individuals were lower than those of the healthy population, except for LF/HF, suggesting that people with depression may be more at risk of cardiovascular diseases than the healthy population.","['adult', 'casecontrol study', 'depression', 'heart rate variability', 'metaanalysis']"
Horizontal inequity in outpatient care use and untreated morbidity: evidence from nationwide surveys in India between 1995 and 2014.,"Equity in healthcare has been a long-term guiding principle of health policy in India. We estimate the change in horizontal inequities in healthcare use over two decades comparing the older population (60 years or more) with the younger population (under 60 years). We used data from the nationwide healthcare surveys conducted in India by the National Sample Survey Organization in 1995-96 and 2014 with sample sizes 633 405 and 335 499, respectively. Bivariate and multivariate logit regression analyses were used to study the socioeconomic differentials in self-reported morbidity (SRM), outpatient care and untreated morbidity. Deviations in the degree to which healthcare was distributed according to need were measured by horizontal inequity index (HI). In each consumption quintile the older population had four times higher SRM and outpatient care rate than the younger population in 2014. In 1995-96, the pro-rich inequity in outpatient care was higher for the older (HI: 0.085; 95% CI: 0.066, 0.103) than the younger population (0.039; 0.034, 0.043), but by 2014 this inequity became similar. Untreated morbidity was concentrated among the poor; more so for the older (-0.320; -0.391, -0.249) than the younger (-0.176; -0.211, -0.141) population in 2014. The use of public facilities increased most in the poorest and poor quintiles; the increase was higher for the older than the younger population in the poorest (1.19 times) and poor (1.71 times) quintiles. The use of public facilities was disproportionately higher for the poor in 2014 than in 1995-96 for the older (-0.189; -0.234, -0.145 vs - 0.065; -0.129, -0.001) and the younger (-0.145; -0.175, -0.115 vs - 0.056; -0.086, -0.026) population. The older population has much higher morbidity and is often more disadvantaged in obtaining treatment. Health policy in India should pay special attention to equity in access to healthcare for the older population.","['Concentration index', 'India', 'healthcare use', 'horizontal inequity', 'older population', 'outpatient', 'untreated morbidity']"
Clinical trials comparing norepinephrine with vasopressin in patients with septic shock: a meta-analysis.,"The effect of norepinephrine in patients with septic shock remains controversial. We conducted a meta-analysis to compare the mortality rates and benefits of norepinephrine and vasopressin.PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library database were searched from database inception to December 2013. We selected randomized controlled trials in adults with septic shock and compared norepinephrine with vasopressin. After assessing the heterogeneity of treatment effects across trials using the I (2) statistic, we used a fixed effects model (P ≥ 0.1) and expressed the results as risk ratios (RRs) for dichotomous outcomes or as standardized mean differences (SMDs) for continuous data with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-analysis was conducted using Review Manager 5.1 software.Seven trials (n = 2323) met the inclusion criteria. Overall, the mortality rate in these seven trials was 36.2% (840/2323). There was no difference in mortality following the use of norepinephrine or vasopressin (RR 1.07; 95%CI 0.97-1.20; P = 0.19). Compared to norepinephrine, vasopressin had no significant effect on heart rate (HR) (SMD 0.21; 95%CI -0.08-0.50; P = 0.15), mean arterial pressure (MAP) (SMD 0.15; 95%CI -0.15-0.44; P = 0.33), cardiac index (CI) (SMD -0.10; 95%CI -0.64-0.44; P = 0.73), systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) (SMD 0.15; 95%CI -0.39-0.70; P = 0.58), oxygen delivery (DO2) (SMD -0.06; 95%CI -0.62-0.49; P = 0.82), oxygen consumption (VO2) (SMD 0.03; 95%CI -0.52-0.59; P = 0.91) or lactic acid (SMD 0.07; 95%CI -0.23-0.36; P = 0.66). No significant heterogeneity was found in these comparisons (P ≥ 0.1).There is not sufficient evidence to prove conclusively that norepinephrine is superior to vasopressin in terms of mortality and hemodynamics. The effects of norepinephrine and vasopressin on patients with septic shock require further study in large randomized controlled trials.","['Metaanalysis', 'Norepinephrine', 'Sepsis', 'Shock', 'Vasopressin']"
Detection of acute myocarditis using T1 and T2 mapping cardiovascular magnetic resonance: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This study was aimed to systematically review the existing literature and explore more the diagnostic value of T1 and T2 mapping in acute myocarditis.Studies were searched from five electronic databases. Sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and summary receiver operating characteristic curves (SROC) were calculated to present diagnostic performance. A meta-regression and subgroup analysis was performed based on validation (endomyocardial biopsy [EMB] vs. clinical criteria).A total of 10 studies were included, with 400 myocarditis patients and 266 controls. Native T1, T2, and extracellular volume (ECV) values were significantly increased in the myocarditis group. Pooled sensitivities for T1, T2 mapping, and ECV were 0.84 (0.78-0.88), 0.77 (0.69-0.83), and 0.69 (0.50-0.83), respectively. Pooled specificities were 0.86 (0.69-0.95), 0.83 (0.73-0.89), and 0.77 (0.63-0.87), respectively. The DORs were 32 (12-87), 16 (8-30), and 7 (4-14), respectively. The areas under the curve (AUC) of SROC were 0.87 (0.84-0.90), 0.86 (0.82-0.89), and 0.80 (0.76-0.83), respectively. In the meta-regression and subgroup analysis, significantly lower specificities of T1 and T2 mapping were observed in EMB studies (p < 0.01).The currently available evidence shows that T1 and T2 mapping including ECV alone offer comparably good diagnostic performance for the detection of acute myocarditis. The reason for the observed mismatch with EMB findings should be further investigated.","['ECV', 'diagnosis', 'mapping', 'metaanalysis', 'myocarditis']"
Effects of Ramadan and Non-ramadan Intermittent Fasting on Body Composition: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Intermittent fasting (IF) has gained popularity for body-composition improvement purposes. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to summarize the effects of Ramadan vs. non-Ramadan IF on parameters of body composition. We conducted a comprehensive search of peer-reviewed articles in three electronic databases: PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science (published until May 2020). Studies were selected if they included samples of adults (≥18 years), had an experimental or observational design, investigated any type of IF and included body composition outcomes. Meta-analytical procedures were conducted when feasible. Sixty-six articles met the eligibility criteria. We found that non-Ramadan IF is effective for decreasing body weight (-0.341 (95% CI [-0.584, -0.098], <i>p</i> = 0.006), body mass index (-0.699, 95% CI [-1.05, -0.347], <i>p</i> < 0.001), and absolute fat mass (-0.447, 95% CI [-0.673, -0.221], <i>p</i> < 0.001). When contrasting pre- post-intervention data on fat-free mass between treatments and controls, group-differences were non-significant (<i>p</i> > 0.05). Conversely, we observed a significant increase in fat-free mass when comparing pre- to post-intervention in a within design fashion (0.306, 95% CI [0.133, 0.48], <i>p</i> = 0.001). Finally, despite being accompanied by dehydration, Ramadan IF is effective in decreasing body weight (-0.353; 95% CI [-0.651, -0.054], <i>p</i> = 0.02) and relative fat mass (-0.533; 95% CI [-1.025, -0.04], <i>p</i> = 0.034). Ramadan IF seems to implicate some beneficial adaptations in weight management, although non-Ramadan IF appears to be more effective in improving overall body composition.","['Energy restriction', 'calorie', 'diet', 'exercise', 'nutrition', 'weight loss']"
Application of artificial intelligence in chronic liver diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The gold standard for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is liver biopsy. Various noninvasive modalities, e.g., ultrasonography, elastography and clinical predictive scores, have been used as alternatives to liver biopsy, with limited performance. Recently, artificial intelligence (AI) models have been developed and integrated into noninvasive diagnostic tools to improve their performance.We systematically searched for studies on AI-assisted diagnosis of liver fibrosis and NAFLD on MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) with their 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were calculated using a random effects model. A summary receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve was generated to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the AI-assisted system. Subgroup analyses by diagnostic modalities, population and AI classifiers were performed.We included 19 studies reporting the performances of AI-assisted ultrasonography, elastrography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and clinical parameters for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis and steatosis. For the diagnosis of liver fibrosis, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and DOR were 0.78 (0.71-0.85), 0.89 (0.81-0.94), 0.72 (0.58-0.83), 0.92 (0.88-0.94) and 31.58 (11.84-84.25), respectively, for cirrhosis; 0.86 (0.80-0.90), 0.87 (0.80-0.92), 0.85 (0.75-0.91), 0.88 (0.82-0.92) and 37.79 (16.01-89.19), respectively; for advanced fibrosis; and 0.86 (0.78-0.92), 0.81 (0.77-0.84), 0.88 (0.80-0.93), 0.77 (0.58-0.89) and 26.79 (14.47-49.62), respectively, for significant fibrosis. Subgroup analyses showed significant differences in performance for the diagnosis of fibrosis among different modalities. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV and DOR were 0.97 (0.76-1.00), 0.91 (0.78-0.97), 0.95 (0.87-0.98), 0.93 (0.80-0.98) and 191.52 (38.82-944.81), respectively, for the diagnosis of liver steatosis.AI-assisted systems have promising potential for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis and NAFLD. Validations of their performances are warranted before implementing these AI-assisted systems in clinical practice.The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42020183295).","['Artificial intelligence', 'Cirrhosis', 'Computerassisted', 'Deep learning', 'Fatty liver', 'Liver fibrosis', 'Liver steatosis', 'Machine learning', 'NAFLD', 'Noninvasive diagnostic tests']"
Association of Peripheral Blood Cell Profile With Alzheimer's Disease: A Meta-Analysis.,"Inflammation and immune dysfunction play significant roles in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related dementia. Changes in peripheral blood cell profiles are a common manifestation of inflammation and immune dysfunction and have been reported in patients with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). We systematically evaluated the association of peripheral blood cell counts and indices with AD or MCI through a meta-analysis.We electronically searched sources to identify all case-control trials comparing peripheral blood cell counts and/or lymphocyte subsets between patients with AD or MCI and healthy controls (HCs). Meta-analyses were used to estimate the between-group standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI).A total of 36 studies involving 2,339 AD patients, 608 MCI patients, and 8,352 HCs were included. AD patients had significantly decreased lymphocyte counts (SMD -0.345, 95% CI [-0.545, -0.146], <i>P</i> = 0.001) and significantly increased leukocyte counts (0.140 [0.039, 0.241], <i>P</i> = 0.006), neutrophil counts (0.309 [0.185, 0.434], <i>P</i> = 0.01), and neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) (0.644 [0.310, 0.978], <i>P</i> < 0.001) compared to HCs. Similarly, significantly increased leukocyte counts (0.392 [0.206, 0.579], <i>P</i> < 0.001), NLR (0.579 [0.310, 0.847], <i>P</i> < 0.001), and neutrophil counts (0.248 [0.121, 0.376], <i>P</i> < 0.001) were found in MCI patients compared with HCs. A significantly decreased percentage of B lymphocytes (-1.511 [-2.775, -0.248], <i>P</i> = 0.019) and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (-0.760 [-1.460, -0.061], <i>P</i> = 0.033) and a significantly increased CD4/CD8 ratio (0.615 [0.074, 1.156], <i>P</i> = 0.026) were observed in AD patients compared to HCs. Furthermore, significant changes in hemoglobin level and platelet distribution width were found in patients with AD or MCI compared with HCs. However, no significant difference was found between AD or MCI patients and HCs in terms of platelet counts, mean corpuscular volume, red cell distribution width, mean platelet volume, and CD4<sup>+</sup> T, CD3<sup>+</sup> T, or natural killer cell counts.Changes in peripheral blood cell profiles, particularly involving leukocyte, lymphocyte, neutrophil, and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell counts, as well as the NLR and the CD4/CD8 ratio, are closely associated with AD. The diagnostic relevance of these profiles should be investigated in future.","['Alzheimers disease', 'lymphocyte subsets', 'metaanalysis', 'mild cognitive impairment', 'peripheral blood']"
Pre-exercise Caffeine Intake Enhances Bench Press Strength Training Adaptations.,"Previous research has identified acute caffeine intake as an effective ergogenic aid to enhance velocity and power during bench press exercise. However, no previous investigation has analyzed the effects of chronic intake of caffeine on training adaptations induced by bench press strength training. Thus, the aim of this investigation was to determine the effects of pre-exercise caffeine intake on training adaptations induced by a bench press training protocol. Using a double-blind, randomized experimental design, 16 healthy participants underwent a bench press training protocol for 4 weeks (12 sessions). Seven participants ingested a placebo and nine participants ingested 3 mg/kg/BM of caffeine before each training session. Three days before, and 3 days after the completion of the training protocol, participants performed a one-repetition maximum (1RM) bench press and force-velocity test (from 10 to 100% 1RM). From comparable pre-training values, the strength training similarly increased 1RM in the caffeine and placebo groups (+13.5 ± 7.8% vs. +11.3 ± 5.3%, respectively; <i>p</i> = 0.53). In the caffeine group, the strength training induced a higher mean velocity at 40%, (0.81 ± 0.08 vs. 0.90 ± 0.14 m/s), 60% (0.60 ± 0.06 vs. 0.65 ± 0.06 m/s), 70% (0.47 ± 0.05 vs. 0.55 ± 0.06 m/s), 80% (0.37 ± 0.06 vs. 0.45 ± 0.05 m/s), 90% (0.26 ± 0.07 vs. 0.34 ± 0.06 m/s), and 100% 1RM (0.14 ± 0.04 vs. 0.25 ± 0.05 m/s; <i>p</i> < 0.05) while the increases in the placebo group were evident only at 30 (0.95 ± 0.06 vs. 1.03 ± 0.07 m/s), 70% (0.51 ± 0.03 vs. 0.57 ± 0.05 m/s) and 80% 1RM (0.37 ± 0.06 vs. 0.45 ± 0.05 m/s) (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The placebo group only increased peak velocity at 60 and 70% 1RM (<i>p</i> < 0.05) while peak velocity increased at 10%, and from 30 to 100% 1RM in the caffeine group (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The use of 3 mg/kg/BM of caffeine before exercise did not modify improvements in 1RM obtained during a 4 week bench press strength training program but induced more muscle performance adaptations over a wider range of load.","['ergogenic aid', 'muscle strength', 'resistance exercise', 'resistance training', 'stimulant']"
Low density lipoprotein cholesterol level inversely correlated with coronary flow velocity reserve in patients with Type 2 diabetes.,"To evaluate the association of coronary artery endothelial function and plasma levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) in patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (DM).We investigated 90 participants from our institution between October 2007 to March 2010: non-DM (n = 60) and DM (n = 30). As an indicator of coronary endothelial dysfunction, we used non-invasive Doppler echocardiography to quantify coronary flow velocity reserve (CFVR) in the distal part of the left descending artery after rest and after intravenous adenosine administration.Plasma level of LDL-C was significantly higher in patients with DM than in non-DM (3.21 ± 0.64 vs. 2.86 ± 0.72 mmo/L, P < 0.05), but HDL-C level did not differ between the groups (1.01 ± 0.17 vs. 1.05 ± 0.19 mmo/L). Furthermore, the CFVR value was lower in DM patients than non-diabetics (2.45 ± 0.62 vs. 2.98 ± 0.68, P < 0.001). Plasma levels of LDL-C were negatively correlated with CFVR in all subjects (r = -0.35, P < 0.001; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.52 - -0.15) and in the non-DM (r = -0.29, P < 0.05; 95% CI: -0.51- -0.05), with an even stronger negative correlation in the DM group (r = -0.42, P < 0.05; 95% CI: -0.68 - -0.06). Age (β = -0.019, s = 0.007, sβ = -0.435, 95% CI: -0.033 - -0.005, P = 0.008), LDL-C (β = -0.217, s = 0.105, sβ = -0.282, 95% CI: -0.428 - -0.005, P = 0.045) remained independently correlated with CFVR in the DM group. However, we found no correlation between HDL-C level and CFVR in any group.Diabetes may contribute to coronary artery disease (CAD) by inducing dysfunction of the coronary artery endothelium. Increased LDL-C level may adversely impair coronary endothelial function in DM. HDL-C may lose its endothelial-protective effects, in part as a result of pathological conditions, especially under abnormal glucose metabolism.","['Coronary flow velocity reserve', 'Diabetes mellitus', 'Endothelial function', 'Highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol', 'Lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol']"
Investigating the Reliability of Novel Nasal Anthropometry Using Advanced Three-Dimensional Digital Stereophotogrammetry.,"Three-dimensional surface imaging systems (3DSI) provide an effective and applicable approach for the quantification of facial morphology. Several researchers have implemented 3D techniques for nasal anthropometry; however, they only included limited classic nasal facial landmarks and parameters. In our clinical routines, we have identified a considerable number of novel facial landmarks and nasal anthropometric parameters, which could be of great benefit to personalized rhinoplasty. Our aim is to verify their reliability, thus laying the foundation for the comprehensive application of 3DSI in personalized rhinoplasty. We determined 46 facial landmarks and 57 anthropometric parameters. A total of 110 volunteers were recruited, and the intra-assessor, inter-assessor, and intra-method reliability of nasal anthropometry were assessed through 3DSI. Our results displayed the high intra-assessor reliability of MAD (0.012-0.29, 0.003-0.758 mm), REM (0.008-1.958%), TEM (0-0.06), rTEM (0.001-0.155%), and ICC (0.77-0.995); inter-assessor reliability of 0.216-1.476, 0.003-2.013 mm; 0.01-7.552%, 0-0.161, and 0.001-1.481%, 0.732-0.985, respectively; and intra-method reliability of 0.006-0.598°, 0-0.379 mm; 0 0.984%, 0-0.047, and 0-0.078%, 0.996-0.998, respectively. This study provides conclusive evidence for the high reliability of novel facial landmarks and anthropometric parameters for comprehensive nasal measurements using the 3DSI system. Considering this, the proposed landmarks and parameters could be widely used for digital planning and evaluation in personalized rhinoplasty, otorhinolaryngology, and oral and maxillofacial surgery.","['3D surface imaging', 'anthropometry', 'nasal morphology', 'reliability']"
The combination of procalcitonin and C-reactive protein or presepsin alone improves the accuracy of diagnosis of neonatal sepsis: a meta-analysis and systematic review.,"Sepsis is an important cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality; therefore, the early diagnosis of neonatal sepsis is essential.Our aim was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin combined with C-reactive protein (PCT + CRP) and presepsin in the diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. We searched seven databases to identify studies that met the inclusion criteria. Two independent reviewers performed data extraction. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), area under curve (AUC), and corresponding 95% credible interval (95% CI) were calculated by true positive (TP), false positive (FP), false negative (FN), and true negative (TN) classification using a bivariate regression model in STATA 14.0 software. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR, DOR, AUC, and corresponding 95% CI were the primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included the sensitivity and specificity in multiple subgroup analyses.A total of 28 studies enrolling 2661 patients were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity of CRP (0.71 (0.63, 0.78)) was weaker than that of PCT (0.85 (0.79, 0.89)), PCT + CRP (0.91 (0.84, 0.95)) and presepsin (0.94 (0.80, 0.99)) and the pooled NLR of presepsin (0.06 (0.02, 0.23)) and PCT + CRP (0.10 (0.05, 0.19)) were less than CRP (0.33 (0.26, 0.42)), and the AUC for presepsin (0.99 (0.98, 1.00)) was greater than PCT + CRP (0.96 (0.93, 0.97)), CRP (0.85 (0.82, 0.88)) and PCT (0.91 (0.89, 0.94)). The results of the subgroup analysis showed that 0.5-2 ng/mL may be the appropriate cutoff interval for PCT. A cut-off value > 10 mg/L for CRP had high sensitivity and specificity.The combination of PCT and CRP or presepsin alone improves the accuracy of diagnosis of neonatal sepsis. However, further studies are required to confirm these findings.","['Creactive protein', 'Metaanalysis', 'Neonatal sepsis', 'Procalcitonin', 'Systematic review']"
Comprehensive evaluation of 45 augmentation drugs for schizophrenia: a network meta-analysis.,"Antipsychotics are the gold standard treatment for schizophrenia, but many patients who receive treatment experience persistent symptoms. The aim of this network meta-analysis was to determine the efficacy of augmentation drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia.In accordance with the PRISMA statement, the PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, CENTRAL, clinical trial and EUDRACT databases were searched from inception to May 15th, 2023. To ensure the robustness of the results, only double-blind randomised controlled trials with a low risk of bias (measured by the Risk Of Bias v2 (ROB2) tool) were included. The studies were categorised according to the background regimen: participants were treated with risperidone, mixed antipsychotics or clozapine. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted using a random effects model. PROSPERO register: CRD42023420964.A total of 44 trials (comprising 45 augmentation drugs and 3358 participants) were included in the analysis. One-third of the drugs (16 drugs) demonstrated significant efficacy vs. placebo for at least one outcome. The most notable effect sizes (ESs) were observed for the use of tropisetron (standard mean difference: -0.83 [95% interval confidence -1.12 to -0.55]), memantine (-0.50 [-0.66 to -0.32]) and minocycline (-0.56 [-0.72 to -0.39]) to treat negative symptoms among patients treated with risperidone (moderate-to-high ESs). Studies involving mixed antipsychotics yielded lower ESs (small-to-moderate). Sodium benzoate (-0.41 [-0.60 to -0.21]) and memantine (-0.23 [-0.36 to -0.11]) were found have significant effects on positive symptoms, while memantine demonstrated efficacy for negative symptoms (-0.32 [-0.45 to -0.19]) and general psychopathology (-0.32 [-0.44 to -0.20]). Studies focusing exclusively on patients treated with clozapine revealed that duloxetine produced the best results (negative symptoms: -1.12 [-1.35 to -0.91]). Sodium benzoate was the only augmentation drug that demonstrated efficacy in relieving persistent positive symptoms (-0.32 [-0.59 to -0.08]) among patients treated with clozapine. Treatment with clozapine in combination with antipsychotics yielded small-to-moderate ESs.The GRADE framework indicated that the quality of the evidence among the included studies was moderate, primarily due to the limited number of randomised controlled trials with a low risk of bias. Important drugs did not appear in these results due to insufficient low-risk-of-bias data for these medications. These results highlight new pathways for treating schizophrenia that should be incorporated into future guidelines after further validation.No funding.","['Antipsychotic', 'Augmentation', 'Mental health', 'Psychiatry', 'Schizophrenia']"
Association between serum polyunsaturated fatty acids and bone mineral density in US adults: NHANES 2011-2014.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between serum polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and bone mineral density (BMD).We performed a cross-sectional study based on data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2014. The weighted multiple linear regression model was utilized to determine the association between serum PUFAs and BMD. Further smoothed curve fitting and threshold effect analysis were conducted. Finally, we performed a subgroup analysis.In total, 1979 participants aged 20-59 years were enrolled. After adjusting for all covariates, we found that serum docosapentaenoic acid (DPA) was positively associated with head BMD (β = 0.0015, 95% Cl: 0.0004, 0.0026, P = 0.008296) and lumbar spine BMD (β = 0.0005, 95% Cl: 0.0000, 0.0010, P = 0.036093), and serum eicosadienoic acid (EDA) was negatively associated with thoracic spine BMD (β = -0.0008, 95% Cl: -0.0016, -0.0000, P = 0.045355). Smoothed curve fitting revealed a nonlinear positive association between serum DPA and lumbar spine BMD. Threshold effect analysis indicated that the threshold of serum DPA was 81.4 µmol/L. Subgroup analysis revealed a positive correlation between serum DPA and head BMD in the subgroup aged 50-59 years (β = 0.0025, 95% Cl: 0.0002, 0.0049, P = 0.035249) and females (β = 0.0026, 95% Cl: 0.0008, 0.0044, P = 0.005005). There was a positive relationship between serum DPA and lumbar spine BMD in females (β = 0.0008, 95% Cl: 0.0001, 0.0015, P = 0.017900) and a negative association between serum EDA and thoracic spine BMD in the subgroup aged 30-39 years (β = -0.0016, 95% Cl: -0.0031, -0.0001, P = 0.041331), males (β = -0.0012, 95% Cl: -0.0023, -0.0001, P = 0.039364) and other races (β = -0.0021, 95% Cl: -0.0037, -0.0006, P = 0.008059).This study demonstrated a linear positive relationship between serum DPA and head BMD, a nonlinear positive association between serum DPA and lumbar spine BMD, and a linear negative correlation between serum EDA and thoracic spine BMD in US adults.","['NHANES', 'bone mineral density', 'docosapentaenoic acid DPA', 'eicosadienoic acid EDA', 'polyunsaturated fatty acids']"
"The influence of the trajectory of obesity indicators on the age of pubertal onset and pubertal tempo in girls: A longitudinal study in Chongqing, China.","This study aims to explore the influence of the trajectory of obesity indicators on the onset age of different pubertal development characteristics and pubertal tempo among girls.Our longitudinal cohort study recruited 734 girls at baseline in May 2014 from a district of Chongqing and followed them at 6-month intervals. Data were available from baseline to the 14th follow-up with a full record of height, weight, waist circumference (WC), breast development, pubic hair, and armpit hair development, as well as the age of menarche. The Group-Based Trajectory Model (GBTM) was fitted for the optimum trajectory of the body mass index (BMI), WC, and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) of girls before the pubertal onset and menarche. The ANOVA and multiple linear regression model were conducted to analyze the influence of the trajectory of obesity indicators on the onset age of different pubertal development characteristics and pubertal tempo in girls.Compared with the healthy (gradual BMI increase) group before pubertal onset, the overweight (persistent BMI increase) group has an earlier onset age of breast development (B: -0.331, 95%CI: -0.515, -0.147) and pubic hair development (B: -0.341, 95%CI: -0.546, -0.136). The B2-B5 development time was shorter in girls in the overweight (persistent BMI increase) group (B: -0.568, 95%CI: -0.831, -0.305) and the obese (rapid BMI increase) group (B: -0.328, 95%CI: -0.524, -0.132). The age of menarche was earlier, and the B2-B5 development time was shorter in girls in the overweight (persistent BMI increase) group than in girls in the healthy (gradual BMI increase) group before menarche (B: -0.276, 95%CI: -0.406, -0.146; B: -0.263, 95%CI: -0.403, -0.123). Girls with high WC (rapid WC increase) before menarche had an earlier age of menarche than normal WC (gradual WC increase) (B: -0.154, 95%CI: -0.301, -0.006), and the B2-B5 development time was shorter in girls in the overweight (gradual WHtR increase) group than in girls in the healthy (persistent WHtR increase) (B: -0.278, 95%CI: -0.529, -0.027) group.Among girls, overweight and obesity (BMI scale) before pubertal onset can not only influence pubertal onset age but also accelerate B2-B5 pubertal tempo. Overweight (BMI scale) and high WC before menarche also have an impact on the age of menarche. Overweight (WHtR scale) before menarche is significantly associated with B2-B5 pubertal tempo.","['BMI', 'pubertal onset', 'pubertal tempo', 'waist circumference', 'waisttoheight ratio']"
Comparative efficacy and safety of antiplatelet or anticoagulant therapy in patients with chronic coronary syndromes after percutaneous coronary intervention: A network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Aimed to evaluate and compare the interactive effects of different antiplatelet or anticoagulation strategies in patients with chronic coronary syndromes (CCS) after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Randomized controlled trials comparing different antiplatelet or anticoagulant strategies in patients with CCS after PCI were included. The primary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE), mortality, ischemic and bleeding events. Compared to aspirin alone, addition of prasugrel or ticagrelor to aspirin resulted in lower risk of myocardial infarction (MI) [odds ratio (OR): 0.38 (95% confidence interval 0.38-0.62); 0.810-0.84 (0.69-0.98)] and any stroke [0.56 (0.42-0.75)] at the expense of increased risk of major bleeding [1.79 (1.34-2.39); 2.08-2.38 (1.56-3.28)], whereas, clopidogrel monotherapy reduced the risk of any stroke, major bleeding, and intracranial bleeding. On subgroup analysis, compared with aspirin alone, addition of prasugrel resulted in lower MACE [0.72 (0.60-0.86)], MI [0.48 (0.38-0.62)], and stent thrombosis [0.29 (0.09-0.91)], whereas, addition of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg resulted in lower risk of MACE [0.72 (0.60-0.87)], cardiac death [0.71 (0.52-0.98)] and any stroke [0.65 (0.45-0.95)], but not reduced MI. Both prasugrel and rivaroxaban 2.5 mg increased major bleeding [1.79 (1.34-2.39); 1.72 (1.33-2.22)]. Clopidogrel monotherapy was associated with lower MACE [0.72 (0.58-0.90)], any stroke [0.42 (0.24-0.73)], and major bleeding [0.62 (0.40-0.96)]. Adding prasugrel or ticagrelor led to a reduced incidence of MI and prasugrel was also found to reduce the risk of MACE and stent thrombosis in CCS patients with low risk of bleeding after PCI. Clopidogrel monotherapy has advantage in reducing MACE, stroke, and major bleeding events in CCS patients at high risk of bleeding after PCI. <b>Systematic Review Registration:</b> https://clinicaltrials.gov/, PROSPERO Identifier: CRD 42021291050.","['anticoagulant', 'antiplatelet therapy', 'chronic coronary syndromes', 'geriatric disease', 'percutaneous coronary intervention', 'randomized control trials']"
Zoledronic Acid Attenuates Early Bone Loss at Forearm in Patients with Acute Spinal Cord Injury.,"Randomized controlled trial.To study the magnitude of bone loss at forearm in persons with acute spinal cord injury (SCI) & the effect of early administration of Zoledronic acid on its' prevention.Sawai Man Singh Medical College, Jaipur, India.Sixty patients with acute SCI were randomized either to receive standard medical and nursing care or Zoledronic acid infusion in combination with standard medical and nursing care. Areal bone mineral density (aBMD) was measured at the forearm (radius + ulna) once patients were medically stable using Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) at baseline and at 3, 6 and 12 months.Significant differences in aBMD was found between the control & Zoledronic acid group at 1/3 forearm (- 0.064; 95% CI - 0.092 to - 0.036, <i>p</i> = 0.001), mid forearm (- 0.059; 95% CI - 0.084 to - 0.034, <i>p </i>= 0.001), UD forearm (- 0.048; 95% CI - 0.097 to 0.001, <i>p </i>= 0.016) and total forearm (- 0.048; 95% CI - 0.088 to - 0.008, <i>p </i>= 0.021) at 1 year in the paraplegic patients with SCI. Similar significant difference was also observed at 1/3 forearm (- 0.046; 95% CI - 0.073 to - 0.019, <i>p </i>= 0.002), mid forearm (- 0.063; 95% CI - 0.088 to - 0.037, <i>p </i>< 0.0001), UD forearm (- 0.084; 95% CI - 0.101 to - 0.067, <i>p </i>< 0.0001) and total forearm (- 0.115; 95% CI - 0.132 to - 0.097, <i>p </i>< 0.0001) respectively at 1 year in the quadriplegic patients with SCI. Significant differences in aBMD between the groups at 6 months post infusion was also observed at these sites in quadriplegic patients. [1/3 forearm - 0.022; 95% CI - 0.039 to - 0.005; <i>p </i>= 0.015, Mid forearm - 0.023; 95% CI - 0.042 to - 0.004; <i>p </i>= 0.019, UD forearm - 0.041; 95% CI - 0.055 to - 0.027; <i>p </i>< 0.0001 and Total forearm - 0.049; 95%CI - 0.062 to - 0.036; <i>p </i>< 0.0001]. Bone loss was reduced in the Zoledronic acid treated group compared to the standard treatment group in both paraplegic and quadriplegic patients.Single dose of 5mg intravenous Zoledronic acid is an effective treatment in preventing bone loss at the forearm for 12 months following acute spinal cord injury.","['Bisphosphonate', 'Bone loss', 'Dual energy xray absorptiometry DXA', 'Osteoporosis', 'Spinal cord injury SCI', 'Zoledronic acid']"
Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor -173 G/C Polymorphism: A Global Meta-Analysis across the Disease Spectrum.,"Human macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) is a cytokine that plays a role in several metabolic and inflammatory processes. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) -173 G/C (rs755622) on <i>MIF</i> gene has been associated with numerous diseases, such as arthritis and cancer. However, most of the reports concerning the association of MIF with these and other pathologies are inconsistent and remain quite controversial. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis from 96 case-control studies on -173 G/C <i>MIF</i> SNP and stratified the data according to the subjects geographic localization or the disease pathophysiology, in order to determine a more meaningful significance to this SNP. The polymorphism was strongly associated with an increased risk in autoimmune-inflammatory, infectious and age-related diseases on the dominant (OR: 0.74 [0.58-0.93], <i>P</i> < 0.01; OR: 0.81 [0.74-0.89], <i>P</i> < 0.0001; and OR: 0.81 [0.76-0.87], <i>P</i> < 0.0001, respectively) and the recessive models (OR: 0.74 [0.57-0.095], <i>P</i> < 0.01; OR: 0.66 [0.48-0.92], <i>P</i> < 0.0154; and OR: 0.70 [0.60-0.82], <i>P</i> < 0.0001, respectively). Also, significant association was found in the geographic localization setting for Asia, Europe and Latin America subdivisions in the dominant (OR: 0.76 [0.69-0.84], <i>P</i> < 0.0001; OR: 0.77 [0.72-0.83], <i>P</i> < 0.0001; OR: 0.61 [0.44-0.83], <i>P</i>-value: 0.0017, respectively) and overdominant models (OR: 0.85 [0.77-0.94], <i>P</i> < 0.0001; OR: 0.80 [0.75-0.86], <i>P</i> < 0.0001; OR: 0.73 [0.63-0.85], <i>P</i>-value: 0.0017, respectively). Afterwards, we implemented a network meta-analysis to compare the association of the polymorphism for two different subdivisions. We found a stronger association for autoimmune than for age-related or autoimmune-inflammatory diseases, and stronger association for infectious than for autoimmune-inflammatory diseases. We report for the first time a meta-analysis of rs755622 polymorphism with a variety of stratified diseases and populations. The study reveals a strong association of the polymorphism with autoimmune and infectious diseases. These results may help direct future research on <i>MIF</i>-173 G/C in diseases in which the relation is clearer and thus assist the search for more plausible applications.","['MIF', 'agerelated', 'autoimmune', 'inflammation', 'metaanalysis']"
Association of foods enriched in conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) and CLA supplements with lipid profile in human studies: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The present study aimed to review the association of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) consumption in two forms, foods enriched in CLA and CLA supplements, with serum lipid profile in human studies.Systematic review and meta-analysis.Search process was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Scopus and Science Direct. Clinical trials that investigated the association of CLA intakes either in the form of supplements or enriched foods with lipid profile in healthy adults were included. All outcomes were recorded as continuous variables, and the effect size was measured by analysis of the mean and standard deviation before and after the intervention for case and control groups.Healthy adult population.CLA supplementation was associated with a significant decrease in LDL cholesterol (mean difference = -0.218; 95% CI -0.358, -0.077; P = 0.002), a non-significant decrease in HDL cholesterol (mean difference = -0.051; 95% CI -0.188, 0.086; P = 0.468), a non-significant increase in total cholesterol (mean difference = 0.009; 95% CI -0.128, 0.146; P = 0.896) and a non-significant decrease in TAG (mean difference = -0.065; 95% CI -0.20, 0.07; P = 0.344). Foods enriched with CLA were associated with significantly decreased LDL cholesterol (mean difference = -0.231; 95% CI -0.438, -0.024; P = 0.028), non-significantly increased HDL-C (mean difference = 0.075; 95% CI -0.121, 0.270; P=0.455), non-significantly decreased total cholesterol (mean difference = -0.158; 95% CI -0.349, 0.042; P = 0.124) and non-significantly decreased TAG (mean difference = -0.078; 95% CI -0.274, 0.117; P = 0.433).According to our analysis, consumption of foods enriched with CLA or CLA supplements has favourable effects on LDL cholesterol levels.","['Conjugated linoleic acid', 'HDL cholesterol', 'LDL cholesterol', 'TAG', 'Total cholesterol']"

"Incidence of venous and arterial thromboembolic events reported in the tofacitinib rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis development programmes and from real-world data.","Tofacitinib is a Janus kinase inhibitor for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), psoriatic arthritis (PsA) and ulcerative colitis, and has been investigated in psoriasis (PsO). Routine pharmacovigilance of an ongoing, open-label, blinded-endpoint, tofacitinib RA trial (Study A3921133; NCT02092467) in patients aged ≥50 years and with ≥1 cardiovascular risk factor identified a higher frequency of pulmonary embolism (PE) and all-cause mortality for patients receiving tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily versus those receiving tumour necrosis factor inhibitors and resulted in identification of a safety signal for tofacitinib. Here, we report the incidence of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), PE, venous thromboembolism (VTE; DVT or PE) and arterial thromboembolism (ATE) from the tofacitinib RA (excluding Study A3921133), PsA and PsO development programmes and observational studies. Data from an ad hoc safety analysis of Study A3921133 are reported separately within.This post-hoc analysis used data from separate tofacitinib RA, PsO and PsA programmes. Incidence rates (IRs; patients with events per 100 patient-years' exposure) were calculated for DVT, PE, VTE and ATE, including for populations stratified by defined baseline cardiovascular or VTE risk factors. Observational data from the US Corrona registries (including cardiovascular risk factor stratification), IBM MarketScan research database and the US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) database were analysed.12 410 tofacitinib-treated patients from the development programmes (RA: n=7964; PsO: n=3663; PsA: n=783) were included. IRs (95% CI) of thromboembolic events among the <i>all tofacitinib cohorts'</i> average tofacitinib 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily treated patients for RA, respectively, were: DVT (0.17 (0.09-0.27) and 0.15 (0.09-0.22)); PE (0.12 (0.06-0.22) and 0.13 (0.08-0.21)); ATE (0.32 (0.22-0.46) and 0.38 (0.28-0.49)). Among PsO patients, IRs were: DVT (0.06 (0.00-0.36) and 0.06 (0.02-0.15)); PE (0.13 (0.02-0.47) and 0.09 (0.04-0.19)); ATE (0.52 (0.22-1.02) and 0.22 (0.13-0.35)). Among PsA patients, IRs were: DVT (0.00 (0.00-0.28) and 0.13 (0.00-0.70)); PE (0.08 (0.00-0.43) and 0.00 (0.00-0.46)); ATE (0.31 (0.08-0.79) and 0.38 (0.08-1.11)). IRs were similar between tofacitinib doses and generally higher in patients with baseline cardiovascular or VTE risk factors. IRs from the overall Corrona populations and in Corrona RA patients (including tofacitinib-naïve/biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug-treated and tofacitinib-treated) with baseline cardiovascular risk factors were similar to IRs observed among the corresponding patients in the tofacitinib development programme. No signals of disproportionate reporting of DVT, PE or ATE with tofacitinib were identified in the FAERS database.DVT, PE and ATE IRs in the tofacitinib RA, PsO and PsA programmes were similar across tofacitinib doses, and generally consistent with observational data and published IRs of other treatments. As expected, IRs of thromboembolic events were elevated in patients with versus without baseline cardiovascular or VTE risk factors, and were broadly consistent with those observed in the Study A3921133 ad hoc safety analysis data, although the IR (95% CI) for PE was greater in patients treated with tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily in Study A3921133 (0.54 (0.32-0.87)), versus patients with baseline cardiovascular risk factors treated with tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily in the RA programme (0.24 (0.13-0.41)).","['DMARDs synthetic', 'psoriatic arthritis', 'rheumatoid arthritis']"
Comparison of three meta-analytic methods using data from digital interventions on type 2 diabetes.,"Pooling the effect sizes of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from continuous outcomes, such as glycated hemoglobin level (HbA1c), is an important method in evidence syntheses. However, due to challenges related to baseline imbalances and pre/post correlations, simple analysis of change scores (SACS) and simple analysis of final values (SAFV) meta-analyses result in under- or overestimation of effect estimates. This study was aimed to compare pooled effect sizes estimated by Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), SACS, and SAFV meta-analyses, using the example of RCTs of digital interventions with HbA1c as the main outcome.Three databases were systematically searched for RCTs published from 1993 through June 2017. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts using predefined eligibility criteria, assessed study quality, and extracted data, with disagreements resolved by arbitration from a third reviewer.ANCOVA, SACS, and SAFV resulted in pooled HbA1c mean differences of -0.39% (95% CI: [-0.51, -0.26]), -0.39% (95% CI: [-0.51, -0.26]), and -0.34% (95% CI: [-0.48-0.19]), respectively. Removing studies with both high baseline imbalance (≥±0.2%) and pre/post correlation of ≥±0.6 resulted in a mean difference of -0.39% (95% CI: [-0.53, -0.26]), -0.40% (95% CI: [-0.54, -0.26]), and -0.33% (95% CI: [-0.48, -0.18]) with ANCOVA, SACS, and SAFV meta-analyses, respectively. Substantial heterogeneity was noted. Egger's test for funnel plot symmetry did not indicate evidence of publication bias for all methods.By all meta-analytic methods, digital interventions appear effective in reducing HbA1c in type 2 diabetes. The effort to adjust for baseline imbalance and pre/post correlation using ANCOVA relies on the level of detail reported from individual studies. Reporting detailed summary data and, ideally, access to individual patient data of intervention trials are essential.","['ANCOVA', 'HbA1c', 'baseline imbalance', 'change scores', 'diabetes', 'eHealth', 'final values', 'systematic reviews']"
Deep learning with test-time augmentation for radial endobronchial ultrasound image differentiation: a multicentre verification study.,"Despite the importance of radial endobronchial ultrasound (rEBUS) in transbronchial biopsy, researchers have yet to apply artificial intelligence to the analysis of rEBUS images.This study developed a convolutional neural network (CNN) to differentiate between malignant and benign tumours in rEBUS images. This study retrospectively collected rEBUS images from medical centres in Taiwan, including 769 from National Taiwan University Hospital Hsin-Chu Branch, Hsinchu Hospital for model training (615 images) and internal validation (154 images) as well as 300 from National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH-TPE) and 92 images were obtained from National Taiwan University Hospital Hsin-Chu Branch, Biomedical Park Hospital (NTUH-BIO) for external validation. Further assessments of the model were performed using image augmentation in the training phase and test-time augmentation (TTA).Using the internal validation dataset, the results were as follows: area under the curve (AUC) (0.88 (95% CI 0.83 to 0.92)), sensitivity (0.80 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.88)), specificity (0.75 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.83)). Using the NTUH-TPE external validation dataset, the results were as follows: AUC (0.76 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.80)), sensitivity (0.58 (95% CI 0.50 to 0.65)), specificity (0.92 (95% CI 0.88 to 0.97)). Using the NTUH-BIO external validation dataset, the results were as follows: AUC (0.72 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.82)), sensitivity (0.71 (95% CI 0.55 to 0.86)), specificity (0.76 (95% CI 0.64 to 0.87)). After fine-tuning, the AUC values for the external validation cohorts were as follows: NTUH-TPE (0.78) and NTUH-BIO (0.82). Our findings also demonstrated the feasibility of the model in differentiating between lung cancer subtypes, as indicated by the following AUC values: adenocarcinoma (0.70; 95% CI 0.64 to 0.76), squamous cell carcinoma (0.64; 95% CI 0.54 to 0.74) and small cell lung cancer (0.52; 95% CI 0.32 to 0.72).Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed CNN-based algorithm in differentiating between malignant and benign lesions in rEBUS images.","['bronchoscopy', 'lung cancer']"
Crystalline lens decentration and tilt in eyes with different axial lengths and their associated factors.,"To analyze crystalline lens decentration and tilt in eyes with different axial lengths (ALs) using a swept-source anterior segment optical coherence tomography (SS-AS-OCT).Patients with normal right eyes who visited our hospital between December 2020 and January 2021 were included in this cross-sectional study. Data on crystalline lens decentration and tilt, AL, aqueous depth (AD), central corneal thickness (CCT), lens thickness (LT), lens vault (LV), anterior chamber width (ACW), and angle κ were collected.A total of 252 patients were included and divided into normal (n = 82), medium-long (n = 89), and long (n = 81) AL groups. The average age of these patients was 43.63 ± 17.02 years. The crystalline lens decentration (0.16 ± 0.08, 0.16 ± 0.09, and 0.20 ± 0.09 mm, P = 0.009) and tilt (4.58° ± 1.42°, 4.06° ± 1.32°, and 2.84° ± 1.19°, P < 0.001) were significantly different among the normal, medium, and long AL groups. Crystalline lens decentration was correlated with AL (r = 0.466, P = 0.004), AD (r = 0.358, P = 0.006), ACW (r = -0.004, P = 0.020), LT (r = -0.141, P = 0.013), and LV (r = -0.371, P = 0.003). Crystalline lens tilt was correlated with age (r = 0.312, P < 0.001), AL (r = -0.592, P < 0.001), AD (r = -0.436, P < 0.001), ACW (r = -0.018, P = 0.004), LT (r = 0.216, P = 0.001), and LV (r = 0.311, P = 0.003).Crystalline lens decentration was positively correlated with AL, and tilt was negatively correlated with AL.","['Crosssectional study', 'SSASOCT', 'crystalline lens decentration', 'crystalline lens tilt', 'ocular biological parameter']"
Physical Activity and Executive Function in Children With ADHD: The Mediating Role of Sleep.,"This study examined the mediating role of sleep in the relationship between physical activity and executive function in children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Fifty-six children with ADHD were recruited from Shenzhen Children's Hospital. Participants wore an accelerometer for seven consecutive days to measure physical activity and sleep quality. Activity counts were analyzed to measure moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Four sleep parameters, including sleep latency (SL), sleep efficiency, total sleep time, and wake after sleep onset were recorded from the actigraph. Three core executive functions, inhibitory control; working memory (WM); and cognitive flexibility (CF), were assessed from computer-based tasks: the flanker task, and the Tower of London and Trail Making Tests, respectively. The regression results showed that MVPA was negatively associated with SL (-0.169; 95%CI [-0.244, -0.112]). WM (total scores) was positively related to MVPA (0.028, 95%CI [0.008, 0.048]), but negatively related to SL (-0.105, 95%CI [-0.167, -0.030]). CF (part B errors) was negatively associated with MVPA (-0.031, 95%CI [-0.055, -0.005]) and positively correlated with SL (0.184, 95%CI [0.092, -0.260]). The indirect effect of SL was found for MVPA and WM (0.018, 95%CI [0.015, 0.034]), supporting the indirect partial mediation. Similarly, the indirect effect of SL was found between MVPA and CF (-0.031, 95%CI [-0.060, -0.012]), supporting the indirect partial mediation. The mediating role of SL in children with ADHD suggests that the intensity of physical activity plays a key role in linking sleep quality and executive function in this group.","['ADHD', 'children', 'executive functions EF', 'physical activity', 'sleep quality']"
A study on the use of acupoint catgut embedding in the treatment of pre-diabetes: a meta-analysis and data mining approach.,"The efficacy of acupoint catgut embedding (ACE) for the treatment of pre-diabetes remains controversial. Therefore, this study investigated the clinical efficacy and acupoint selection in ACE for the treatment of pre-diabetes.Eight common databases were searched for relevant literature on ACE for pre-diabetes. Meta-analysis was used to evaluate its efficacy and safety, and data mining was used to explore the protocol for acupoint selection.The meta-analysis revealed that compared with conventional treatment alone, conventional treatment combined with ACE reduced the levels of glycated hemoglobin A1c [mean difference (MD) -0.45, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.67 to -0.24%, <i>p</i> < 0.001], fasting blood glucose (MD -0.61 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.87 to -0.36 mmol/L, <i>p</i> < 0.001), 2-h postprandial glucose (MD -0.77 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.98 to -0.55 mmol/L, <i>p</i> < 0.001), total cholesterol (MD -0.37 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.74 to 0.00 mmol/L, <i>p</i> = 0.049), triglyceride (MD -0.49 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.77 to -0.20 mmol/L, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD -0.23 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.12 mmol/L, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and increased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (MD 0.16 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.27 mmol/L, <i>p</i> = 0.004), whereas changes in the body mass index and the adverse event rates were comparable between groups. Data mining revealed that Pishu (BL20), Weiwanxiashu (EX-B3), Zusanli (ST36), Shenshu (BL23), Sanyinjiao (SP6), Weishu (BL21), and Taixi (KI3) were the core acupoints used in ACE for pre-diabetes.ACE can effectively improve blood glucose and lipid levels in pre-diabetes patients and has a good safety profile. ACE consisting of Pishu (BL20), Weiwanxiashu (EX-B3), Zusanli (ST36), Shenshu (BL23), Sanyinjiao (SP6), Weishu (BL21), and Taixi (KI3), is a promising complementary strategy for the treatment of pre-diabetes.","['Chinese medicine', 'acupoint', 'acupoint catgut embedding', 'data mining', 'metaanalysis', 'prediabetes']"
Digestive efficiency traits in growing pigs are genetically correlated with sow litter traits in the Large White breed.,"Digestive efficiency traits are promising selection criteria to improve feed efficiency in pigs. However, the genetic relationships between digestive efficiency and sow reproductive traits are mostly unknown and need to be estimated. In this study, reproductive traits were available for 61 601 litters recorded on 21 719 Large White purebred sows. The traits were comprised of the number of born alive (NBA) and the number of weaned piglets (NWP), the number of stillbirths (NSB) and piglet mortality during suckling (PM). For a subset of 32518 litters, the mean (MBW) and CV of piglet birth weights (CVBW) were deduced from individual piglet weights as well as the proportion of piglets weighing less than 1 kg (PPL1K). Growth and feed efficiency traits were available for 4 643 Large White male pigs related to sows with reproductive performances. They comprised average daily gain (ADG), daily feed intake (DFI) and feed conversion ratio (FCR). A subset of 1 391 pigs had predictions for digestibility coefficients (DC) of energy, organic matter and nitrogen obtained by analysing faecal samples with near-infrared spectrometry. Estimated heritabilities were low for NBA, NSB, NWP and PM (0.08 ± 0.01 to 0.11 ± 0.01) and low to moderate for litter weight characteristics (0.14 ± 0.02 to 0.38 ± 0.01). Heritability estimates were moderate to high for ADG, DFI and FCR (0.37 ± 0.04 to 0.54 ± 0.05) and moderate for DC traits (0.26 ± 0.06 to 0.38 ± 0.07). Genetic correlations were low between ADG, or alternatively FCR, and reproductive traits. They were significantly different from zero with MBW (0.19 ± 0.06 with ADG and -0.15 ± 0.06 with FCR) and PPL1K (-0.19 ± 0.07 with ADG and 0.18 ± 0.07 with FCR). All genetic correlations between DFI and reproductive traits were low and not significantly different from zero. Genetic correlations between DC traits and NBA were significantly different from zero for DC of organic matter and energy (<-0.25 ± 0.11). DC traits were moderately correlated with MBW (>0.30 ± 0.11), CVBW (<-0.36 ± 0.11) and PPL1K (<-0.37 ± 0.11) at the genetic level. Genetic correlations between DC traits and PM were significantly negative and hence favourable (<-0.38 ± 0.12). Finally, genetic correlations between DC traits and NWP were close to zero. These results suggested that sows closely related to growing pigs with the best digestive efficiency would produce heavier and more homogeneous piglets, with slightly smaller litter sizes at birth but better survival. Hence, there is usable genetic variation in DC that could be exploited to define new selection strategies in maternal lines aiming at improving not only feed efficiency but also piglet survival.","['Digestibility coefficients', 'Feed efficiency', 'Litter size', 'Pig', 'Piglet survival']"
"Associations of Ultra-Processed and Unprocessed/Minimally Processed Food Consumption with Peripheral and Central Hemodynamics, and Arterial Stiffness in Young Healthy Adults.","Consumption of ultra-processed food (UPF) replaces the intake of freshly prepared unprocessed/minimally processed food (MPF) and is positively associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD). The objective of this observational study was to investigate the relation between (<b>1</b>) UPF and (<b>2</b>) MPF with peripheral and central blood pressure (BP), wave reflection, and arterial stiffness. Habitual dietary intake, ambulatory BP, augmentation index (AIx), and pulse wave velocity (PWV) were assessed in 40 normotensive young adults (15 M/25 W; 27 ± 1 y; body mass index 23.6 ± 0.5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). UPF consumption was positively associated with overall and daytime peripheral systolic BP (B = 0.25, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.03, 0.46, <i>p</i> = 0.029; B = 0.32, 95% CI 0.09, 0.56, <i>p</i> = 0.008, respectively), daytime diastolic BP (B = 0.18, 95% CI 0.01, 0.36, <i>p</i> = 0.049) and daytime peripheral pulse pressure (PP; B = 0.22, 95% CI 0.03, 0.41, <i>p</i> = 0.027). MPF consumption was inversely associated with daytime peripheral PP (B = -0.27, 95% CI -0.47, -0.07, <i>p</i> = 0.011), overall and daytime central systolic BP (B = -0.27, 95% CI -0.51, -0.02, <i>p</i> = 0.035; B = -0.31, 95% CI -0.58, -0.04, <i>p</i> = 0.024, respectively), and nighttime central PP (B = -0.10, 95% CI -0.19, -0.01, <i>p</i> = 0.042). Both UPF and MPF were not associated with AIx nor PWV. These data suggest avoidance of UPF and consumption of more MPF may reduce CVD risk factors.","['NOVA classification', 'arterial stiffness', 'augmentation index', 'blood pressure', 'minimally processed food', 'ultraprocessed food', 'unprocessed food', 'wave reflection']"
"Are single entry communities and cul-de-sacs a barrier to active transport to school in 11 elementary schools in Las Vegas, NV metropolitan area?","Single entry communities (SECs) and cul-de-sacs minimize route choices and increase trip distance. Las Vegas' built environment facilitates the examination of these variables and active transport to school (ATS) rates. The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of SECs and cul-de-sacs on ATS rates in Las Vegas, NV elementary children. Parental-reported data was collected from 11 elementary schools on ATS rates (n = 1217). SECs and cul-de-sacs were quantified for each school zone. Logistic regression models were used to predict ATS. 23.9% of students reported ATS all of the time and 31.4% some of the time. SECs per school zone ranged from 0 to 25 (mean = 11.9). Cul-de-sacs ranged from 12 to 315 (mean = 138.3). Some ATS use was predicted by distance from school (p ≤ 0.001;OR = 0.61), parental education (high school: p = 0.004;OR = 0.53, some college: p = 0.001;OR = 0.50, 4 year degree: p = 0.004;OR = 0.52) and cul-de-sacs (p ≤ 0.001;OR = 0.99). A separate model using distance from school (p ≤ 0.001;OR = 0.61), parental education (high school: p = 0.002;OR = 0.51, some college: p ≤ 0.001;OR = 0.45, 4 year degree: p ≤ 0.001;OR = 0.45) and SECs (p ≤ 0.001;OR = 0.96) predicted some ATS. All ATS use was predicted by distance from school (p ≤ 0.001;OR = 0.58), parental education (Grades 9-11: p = 0.05;OR = 0.61, high school: p ≤ 0.001;OR = 0.45, some college: p ≤ 0.001;OR = 0.41, 4 year degree: p ≤ 0.001;OR = 0.38) and SECs (p ≤ 0.001;OR = 0.97). A separate model using distance from school (p ≤ 0.001;OR = 0.58), parental education (Grades 9-11: p = 0.041;OR = 0.59, high school: p ≤ 0.001;OR = 0.47, some college: p ≤ 0.001;OR = 0.44, 4 year degree: p ≤ 0.001;OR = 0.43) and cul-de-sacs (p ≤ 0.001;OR = 0.99) predicted all ATS. Current findings reveal that both SECs and cul-de-sacs were predictors of ATS beyond distance. Students with more SECs and cul-de-sacs in their school zone were less likely to utilize ATS.","['Active living', 'Biking', 'Physical activity', 'Safe Routes to School', 'Trip distance', 'Walkability']"
Individual and societal risk factors of attitudes justifying intimate partner violence against women: a multilevel cross-sectional study.,"Attitudes justifying intimate partner violence against women (IPVAW) can play an essential role in explaining the prevalence of such public health problem. The study aim was to explain attitudes justifying IPVAW identifying individual and societal risk factors.A multilevel cross-sectional study of the World Values Survey (WVS) in 54 global countries.A representative transnational community-based sample of 81 516 participants (47.8% male, 52.1% female), aged mean of 42.41.Attitudes justifying IPVAW, sociodemographic, sexism, self-transcendence and conservation values were measured using questions from WVS. Country and regional gender inequality were assessed by Gender Inequality Index.Around 16% (intraclass correlation=0.16) of individual differences in attitudes justifying IPVAW are explained by countries. Statistically significant predictors at individual and country level were: sex (B=-0.24, 95% CI -0.27 to -0.22), age (B=-0.08 to -0.25, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.03), marital status (B=0.09 to 0.23, 95% CI 0.002 to 0.33), educational level (B=-0.10 to -0.14, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.04), self-transcendence values (B=-0.10, 95% CI -0.20 to -0.12), sexism (B=0.21, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.28), country (B=2.18, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.26) and regional (B=2.23, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.42) gender inequality. Country gender inequality (B=-0.18, p=0.12) and regional gender inequality (B=-0.21, p=0.10) did not moderate the associations between self-transcendence values and attitudes justifying IPVAW. In the same way for sexism, data did not provide support for a moderating role of country gender inequality (B=0.22, p=0.26) and regional gender inequality (B=0.10, p=0.66).Individual and country predictors accounted for differences in attitudes justifying IPVAW. However, neither gender inequality of country nor gender inequality of region interacted with sexism and self-transcendence values. Theoretical and methodological implications are discussed.","['public health', 'social medicine', 'statistics  research methods']"
Carbamate pesticides exposure and delayed physical development at the age of seven: Evidence from the SMBCS study.,"Carbamate pesticides are widely used in agriculture and cause widespread human exposure. The health effect of carbamates on physical development remains unclear. The current study aimed to explore the carbamate's health effect on physical development.Prenatal, 3-year-old, 7-year-old urinary carbofuranphenol concentration was measured by gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry and adjusted by creatinine. Anthropometric indices were measured by standard method and z-score standardized. Generalized linear models (GLM) were using to assess associations between exposure measurements and anthropometric indices. The generalized estimate equation (GEE) was applied to analyze the association between multiperiod exposure and anthropometric indices, and time-interaction terms were used to exam health effect consistency of exposure in each period. Gender-stratified analysis were conducted according to results of gender-interaction terms to identify gender-specific effects.The gender-interaction term of prenatal exposure with height z-score was significant (β = -0.057; 95% CI: -0.113, -0.001; p = 0.045). The 3-year-old carbofuranphenol level showed negative associations with weight z-score (β = -0.019; 95% CI: -0.038, -0.000; p = 0.040), height z-score (β = -0.015; 95% CI: -0.028, -0.001; p = 0.026), chest circumference (β = -0.086; 95% CI: -0.171, -0.001; p = 0.046), and waist circumference (β = -0.128; 95% CI: -0.230, -0.026; p = 0.014). No statistically significant trend was found for prenatal and 7-year-old carbofuranphenol levels. In GEEs, carbofuranphenol level was negatively associated with weight z-score (β = -0.103; 95% CI: -0.195, -0.011; p = 0.027), height z-score (β = -0.087; 95% CI: -0.152, -0.022; p = 0.008), and chest circumference (β = -0.472; 95% CI: -0.918, -0.026; p = 0.037). Boy's height z-score was inversely associated with carbamate exposure (β = -0.140; 95% CI: -0.227, -0.053; p = 0.001).Prenatal and postnatal carbamate exposure may affect physical developmental process.","['Birth cohort', 'Carbamate pesticides', 'Carbofuranphenol', 'Physical development']"
Systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiologic data on vaccine response in relation to exposure to five principal perfluoroalkyl substances.,"Epidemiologic studies of serum per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and antibody response to vaccines have suggested an adverse association, but the consistency and magnitude of this association remain unclear.The goal of this systematic review was to determine the size of the association between a doubling in perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) serum concentration and difference in log<sub>e</sub> antibody concentration following a vaccine, with a focus on five PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA).We conducted online searches of PubMed and Web of Science through May 17, 2022 and identified 14 eligible reports published from 2012 to 2022.We included studies conducted in humans, including mother-child pairs, which examined serum PFAS concentration in relation to serum concentration of antibody to a specific antigen following a vaccine.We used the risk of bias assessment for non-randomized studies of exposure and certainty assessment method proposed by Morgan et al. (2019). Using a multilevel meta-regression model, we quantitatively synthesized the data.The 14 reports represented 13 unique groups of subjects; the frequency of studies of a given antibody was Tetanus (n = 7); followed by Diphtheria (6); Measles (4); Rubella (3); Haemophilus influenzae type b and Influenza A H1N1 (2 each); and Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Influenza A H2N3, Influenza B, and Mumps (1 each). There were approximately 4,830 unique participants included in the analyses across the 14 reports. The models of coefficients between antibody concentration and the five principal PFAS showed homogeneity of associations across antibody types for each principal PFAS. In the models with all antibodies treated as one type, evidence of effect modification by life stage was present for PFOA and PFOS, and for consistency, all associations were evaluated for all ages and for children. The summary associations (coefficients for difference in log<sub>e</sub>[antibody concentration] per doubling of serum PFAS) with 95% confidence intervals that excluded zero (""statistical support""), and certainty of evidence ratings were as follows: for PFOA and all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, -0.06 (-0.10, -0.01; moderate) and in children, -0.10 (-0.16, -0.03; moderate); for Diphtheria in children, -0.12 (-0.23, -0.00; high); for Rubella in all ages, -0.09 (-0.17, -0.01; moderate), and for Tetanus in children, -0.12 (-0.24, -0.00; moderate). For PFOS the summary associations were, for all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, -0.06 (-0.11, -0.01; moderate) and in children, -0.10 (-0.18, -0.03; moderate); for Rubella in all ages, -0.09 (-0.15, -0.03; high) and in children, -0.12 (-0.20, -0.04; high). For PFHxS the summary associations were, for all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, -0.03 (-0.06, -0.00; moderate) and in children, -0.05 (-0.09, -0.00; low); and for Rubella in children, -0.07 (-0.11, -0.02; high). Summary associations for PFNA and PFDA did not have statistical support, but all PFAS studied tended to have an inverse association with antibody concentrations.Epidemiologic data on immunosuppression and five principal PFAS suggest an association, with support across antibodies against multiple types of antigens. Data on Diphtheria, Rubella, and Tetanus were more supportive of an association than for other antibodies, and support was greater for associations with PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS, than for PFNA or PFDA. The data on any specific antibody were scarce. Confounding factors that might account for the relation were not identified. Nearly all studies evaluated were judged to have a low or moderate risk of bias.","['Alkanesulfonic acids', 'Antibodies', 'Fluorocarbons', 'Immunomodulation', 'Perfluoroalkyl substances', 'Vaccination']"
"Association between circulating microRNAs 486, 146b and 15b and serum betatrophin levels in obese; type 2 diabetic and non-diabetic children.","This study tested the association between serum levels of microRNA-486, -146b and -15b and betatrophin in normal and obese children with/without type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).the study included 120 children; divided into three groups: G1 (50 healthy), G2 (35 obese) and G3 (35 obese with T2DM). The levels of microRNA-486, 146b and 15b and serum betatrophin were measured by their corresponding methods.serum microRNA-486, -146b, -15b and betatrophin levels were significantly high in G3 followed by G2 then G1 (p = 0.002, > 0.001, > 0.001, and > 0.001, respectively). Especially in G3, these levels correlated positively with the BMI percentile (r = 0.44, 0.58, 0.38, and 0.46, p = 0.007, > 0.001, 0.021, and 0.005, respectively), serum glucose (r = 0.56, 0.49, 0.82, 0.60, and 0.42, p > 0.001, 0.003, > 0.001, and > 0.001, respectively) and HbA1c% (r = 0.56, 0.39, 0.66, and 0.42, p > 0.001, 0.019, > 0.001, and 0.032, respectively) while, showed negative correlations with correlated with serum insulin levels (r = - 0.37, - 0.42, - 0.58, and - 0.41, p = 0.021, 0.012, > 0.001 and 0.013, respectively) and with serum C-peptide levels (r = - 0.76, - 0.50, - 0.35 and - 0.42, p > 0.001, 0.002, 0.036 and 0.011, respectively). Serum betatrophin levels correlated positively with microRNA-486, -146b and -15b levels in G2 (r = 0.35, 0.80, and 0.67, p = 0.036, > 0.001, and,> 0.001, respectively), and in G3 (r = 0.57, 0.36, and 0.38, p > 0.001, 0.029 and, 0.023, respectively).Circulating microRNA-486, 146b and 15b increase significantly in obese children with T2DM and these levels correlate positively with serum betatrophin levels.

Genetic variance and covariance components for carbon dioxide production and postweaning traits in Angus cattle.,"This experiment investigated phenotypic and genetic relationships between carbon dioxide production, methane emission, feed intake, and postweaning traits in Angus cattle. Respiration chamber data on 1096 young bulls and heifers from 2 performance recording research herds of Angus cattle were analyzed to provide phenotypic and genetic parameters for carbon dioxide production rate (CPR; n = 425, mean 3,010 ± SD 589 g/d) and methane production rate (MPR; n = 1,096, mean 132.8 ± SD 25.2 g/d) and their relationships with dry matter intake (DMI; n = 1,096, mean 6.15 ± SD 1.33 kg/d), body weight (BW) and body composition traits. Heritability estimates were moderate to high for CPR (0.53 [SE 0.17]), MPR (0.31 [SE 0.07]), DMI (0.49 [SE 0.08]), yearling BW (0.46 [SE 0.08]), and scanned rib fat depth (0.42 [SE 0.07]). There was a strong phenotypic (0.83 [SE 0.02]) and genetic (0.75 [SE 0.10]) correlation between CPR and MPR. The correlations obtained for DMI with CPR and with MPR were high, both phenotypically (rp) and genetically (rg) (rp: 0.85 [SE 0.01] and 0.71 [SE 0.02]; rg (0.95 [SE 0.03] and 0.83 [SE 0.05], respectively). Yearling BW was strongly correlated phenotypically (rp ≥ 0.60) and genetically (rg > 0.80) with CPR, MPR, and DMI, whereas scanned rib fat was weakly correlated phenotypically (rp < 0.20) and genetically (rg ≤ 0.20) with CPR, MPR, and DMI. The strong correlation between both CPR and MPR with DMI confirms their potential use as proxies for DMI in situations where direct DMI recording is not possible such as on pasture.","['carbon dioxide', 'cattle', 'genetics', 'growth', 'methane']"
The comparison of fluticasone propionate/formoterol with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol for paediatric asthma: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"The comparison of fluticasone propionate/formoterol (FP/FORM) with fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/SAL) for paediatric asthma remains controversial.We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the efficacy and safety of FP/FORM versus FP/SAL for paediatric asthma.We have searched PubMed, Embase, Web of science, EBSCO, and Cochrane library databases through August 2019 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of FP/FORM versus FP/SAL for paediatric asthma. This meta-analysis is performed using the random-effects model.Three RCTs are included in the meta-analysis. Overall for paediatric asthma, FP/FORM and FP/SAL demonstrate a comparable influence on FEVj (Std. MD = -0.01; 95% CI: -0.04 to 0.03; <i>p</i> = 0.62), FVC (Std.

Perceived stress and psychological disorders in healthcare professionals: a multiple chain mediating model of effort-reward imbalance and resilience.,"Healthcare professionals have shown more psychological disorders such as anxiety and depression due to the nature of work, which can cause job burnout, decrease the quality of medical services, and even endanger medical safety. The aim of the study is to explore the serial multiple mediating role of effort- reward imbalance and resilience between perceived stress and psychological disorders among healthcare professionals.A cross-sectional study was conducted in China from February to April 2023. A total of 2098 healthcare professionals at a tertiary general hospital was investigated by the following self-reported questionnaires: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), The Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI), Healthcare professionals Resilience Scale (MSRS).Anxiety and depression are interrelated (<i>r</i> = 0.362, <i>p</i> < 0.01), and they were positively related to perceived stress (<i>r</i> = 0.640/0.607, <i>p</i> < 0.01) and ERI (<i>r</i> = 0.422/0.383, <i>p</i> < 0.01), and negatively related to resilience (<i>r</i> = -0.343/-0.320, <i>p</i> < 0.01). After controlling demographic factors, the variance in anxiety and depression was explained by perceived stress was 37.7 and 35.0%. Bootstrap analyses examining the pathway of perceived stress-ERI-resilience-anxiety revealed significant direct effects [<i>B</i> = 0.560, 95%CI (0.528, 0.591)], as well as indirect effects mediated independently by ERI [<i>B</i> = 0.045, 95%CI (0.029, 0.060)], resilience [<i>B</i> = 0.031, 95%CI (0.017, 0.047)], or a combination of both [B = 0.004, 95%CI (0.002, 0.007)]. Similarly, in the path of perceived stress-ERI-resilience-anxiety-depression, significant direct effects were found [<i>B</i> = -0.310, 95%CI(0.265, 0.351)], along with indirect effects mediated individually by ERI [<i>B</i> = 0.033, 95%CI(0.013, 0.052)], resilience [<i>B</i> = 0.014, 95%CI (0.001, 0.028)], and anxiety [<i>B</i> = 0.218, 95%CI (0.190, 0.246)], or by both or three together (<i>B</i> = 0.032).This study proved the hypothesis that ERI and resilience played a mediating role in perceived stress and psychological disorders, revealed the potential mechanism of anxiety in stress and depression, and proposed a solution for perceived stress to psychological distress, which can provide a basis for the intervention of healthcare professionals in the face of mental health crisis.","['anxiety', 'depression', 'effortreward imbalance', 'healthcare professionals', 'perceived stress', 'resilience', 'serial multiple mediation']"
Health-related quality of life and its determinants in patients with different dermatological disorders at the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital.,"Evidence shows that majority of dermatological disorders affect the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of patients. However, the extent of its negative impact and predictors has not been studied in Ethiopia. Thus, this study looked at assessing the HRQoL and determinants in patients with dermatological disorders (DDs) attending the University of Gondar Comprehensive Specialized Hospital (UoGCSH).Patients with dermatological disorders (n = 400) were included in the final analysis using a systematic random sampling technique. The mean age of the participants was 39.79 (± 17.17) years. The average (± SD) score of EQ-5D-5 L was 1.92 (± 0.74). Regarding domains, pain/discomfort accounted for a higher proportion 59 (22.3%) followed by anxiety/depression 61 (15.3%). Receiving topical preparations (β = -0.399, 95% CI: -0.6, - 0.19; < 0.001), systemic only medication (β = -0.378, 95% CI: -0.607, -0.149; p = 0.002), having slight, mild, and moderate skin diseases found to have an inverse association with impaired HRQoL, (β = -0.654, 95% CI; -1.01, -0.290); p < 0.001), (β = -0.748, 95% CI: -0.960, -0.538; p < 0.001), and (β = -0.465, 95% CI: -0.642, -0.283; p < 0.001), respectively. Furthermore, age (β = 0.011, 95% CI: 0.006, 0.016; p = 0.001), long duration with skin disease (β = 0.046, 95% CI: 0.015, 0.352; p = 0.013), and presence of comorbidity (β = 0.251, 95% CI: 0.096, 0.402; p = 0.002) were significant predictors of HRQoL among dermatological disease patients.Patients with dermatological disease were found to have a compromised HRQoL.

Risk factors for developmental quotients in ASD children: A cross-sectional study.,"To analyze the risk factors for developmental quotients (DQs) of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and to better understand the effects of screen time on neurodevelopment in children with ASD.We retrospectively analyzed the data of 382 children with ASD, including demographic profiles; socioeconomic status; score on the Chinese parent-child interaction scale (CPCIS); screen time questionnaire; ASD symptom rating scales, including the Autism Behavior Checklist (ABC), Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS), and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule Second Edition (ADOS-2); and DQs using Griffiths Development Scales-Chinese Edition. Univariate analysis was carried out to analyze the factors related to the DQs of children with ASD, and then the linear regression model was used to identify the independent influencing factors of the DQs of children with ASD.Vitamin D (β = 0.180, <i>p</i> = 0.002), age (β = -0.283, <i>p</i> = 0.000) and CARS score (β = -0.347, <i>p</i> = 0.000) are risk factors related to DQ of locomotor in children with ASD. Vitamin D (β = 0.108, <i>p</i> = 0.034), CARS score (β =  -0.503, <i>p</i> = 0.000), ADOS-2 severity score (β =  -0.109, <i>p</i> = 0.045) and CPCIS score (β = 0.198, <i>p</i> = 0.000) are risk factors related to DQ of personal social skill in children with ASD. Vitamin D (β = 0.130, <i>p</i> = 0.018), CARS score (β =  -0.469, <i>p</i> = 0.000), and CPCIS score (β = 0.133, <i>p</i> = 0.022) are risk factors related to DQ of hearing-speech in children with ASD. Vitamin D (β = 0.163, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and CARS score (β =  -0.471, <i>p</i> = 0.000) are risk factors related to DQ of eye-hand coordination in children with ASD. Age (β =  -0.140, <i>p</i> = 0.020), CARS score (β =  -0.342, <i>p</i> = 0.000), ADOS-2 severity score (β = -0.133, <i>p</i> = 0.034) and CPCIS score (β = 0.193, <i>p</i> = 0.002) are risk factors related to DQ of performance in children with ASD. Vitamin D (β = 0.801, <i>p</i> = 0.000) and CPCIS score (β = 0.394, <i>p</i> = 0.019) are risk factors related to DQ of practical reasoning in children with ASD.Vitamin D status, the severity of autistic symptoms and parent-child interaction are risk factors for developmental quotients in children with ASD. Screen exposure time is negatively associated with DQs in children with ASD but is not an independent risk factor for DQs.","['25hydroxyvitamin D', 'environmental factors', 'neurodevelopmental disorder', 'screen time', 'sedentary behavior']"
Characteristics and Prognostic Factors of Pulmonary Fibrosis After COVID-19 Pneumonia.,"Few is known about the long-term pulmonary sequelae after COVID-19 infection. Hence, the aim of this study is to characterize patients with persisting pulmonary sequelae at follow-up after hospitalization. We also aimed to explore clinical and radiological predictors of pulmonary fibrosis following COVID-19.Two hundred and 20 consecutive patients were evaluated at 3-6 months after discharge with high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) and categorized as recovered (REC) or not recovered (NOT-REC). Both HRCTs at hospitalization (HRCT<sub>0</sub>), when available, and HRCT<sub>1</sub> during follow-up were analyzed semiquantitatively as follows: ground-glass opacities (alveolar score, AS), consolidations (CONS), and reticulations (interstitial score, IS).A total of 175/220 (80%) patients showed disease resolution at their initial radiological evaluation following discharge. NOT-REC patients (45/220; 20%) were mostly older men [66 (35-85) years vs. 56 (19-87); <i>p</i> = 0.03] with a longer in-hospital stay [16 (0-75) vs. 8 (1-52) days; <i>p</i> < 0.0001], and lower P/F at admission [233 (40-424) vs. 318 (33-543); <i>p</i> = 0.04]. Moreover, NOT-REC patients presented, at hospital admission, higher ALV [14 (0.0-62.0) vs. 4.4 (0.0-44.0); <i>p</i> = 0.0005], CONS [1.9 (0.0-26.0) vs. 0.4 (0.0-18.0); <i>p</i> = 0.0064], and IS [11.5 (0.0- 29.0) vs. 0.0 (0.0-22.0); <i>p</i> < 0.0001] compared to REC patients. On multivariate analysis, the presence of CONS and IS at HRCT<sub>0</sub> was independent predictors of radiological sequelae at follow-up [OR 14.87 (95% CI: 1.25-175.8; <i>p</i> = 0.03) and 28.9 (95% CI: 2.17-386.6; <i>p</i> = 0.01, respectively)].In our population, only twenty percent of patients showed persistent lung abnormalities at 6 months after hospitalization for COVID-19 pneumonia. These patients are predominantly older men with longer hospital stay. The presence of reticulations and consolidation on HRCT at hospital admission predicts the persistence of radiological abnormalities during follow-up.","['SARSCoV2', 'coronavirus disease 2019', 'highresolution computed tomography', 'pulmonary fibrosis', 'pulmonary sequelae']"
Parental burnout of parents of primary school students: an analysis from the perspective of job demands-resources.,"Based on the theory of Job Demands-Resources, this study has been set out to examine how parenting demands, parenting resources affect parental burnout of primary school students' parents.An online survey with four scales (Parenting Stress Scale, Perceived Family Support Scale, Psychological Resilience Scale and Parental Burnout Scale) was completed by 600 parents of students from three primary schools in Central China. Structural equation models were implemented.Parenting stress had a positive impact on parental burnout (<i>β</i> = 0.486, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Both perceived family support (<i>β</i> = -0.228, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and psychological resilience (<i>β</i> = -0.332, <i>p</i> = 0.001) had a negative impact on parental burnout. Perceived family support played a moderating role between parenting stress and parental burnout (<i>β</i> = -0.121, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Psychological resilience also played a moderating role between parenting stress and parental burnout (<i>β</i> = -0.201, <i>p <</i> 0.001). Psychological resilience partially mediated the relationship between perceived family support and parental burnout. The total effect was -0.290, with 95% CI (-0.350, -0.234). Direct effect was -0.228, with 95% CI (-0.283, -0.174), and indirect effect was -0.062, with 95% CI (-0.092, -0.037).Parental burnout may be reduced by increasing family support and self-improvement of psychological resilience. In the same way, the impact of parenting stress on parental burnout may be buffered under high-pressure situations.","['job demandsresources theory', 'parental burnout', 'parenting stress', 'perceived family support', 'resilience']"
Role of FEF25-75 in characterizing outpatients with asthma in clinical practice.,"Asthma is characterized by variable airflow limitation. FEF<sub>25-75</sub> has been proposed as a reliable marker for bronchial obstruction, especially when FEV<sub>1</sub> and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC are normal.To investigate the role of FEF<sub>25-75</sub> in patients with asthma seen in clinical settings.The cross-sectional study included 439 (181 females and 255 males; mean age 39 years) outpatients with asthma who consecutively visited an allergy clinic for a routine assessment. History, physical examination, asthma control, and spirometry were evaluated.FEF<sub>25-75</sub> was impaired (< 65% of predicted) in 136 (31%) outpatients. Considering only subjects with normal FEV<sub>1</sub> and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, FEF<sub>25-75</sub> was impaired in 71 (19.6%) subjects. In this subset, impaired FEF<sub>25-75</sub> was associated with low FEV<sub>1</sub> and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC values (OR 0.91 and 0.85, respectively), and presence of asthma symptoms (OR 2.19).FEF<sub>25-75</sub> deserves adequate and careful consideration in patients with asthma and normal FEV<sub>1</sub> and FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC, as the presence of impaired FEF<sub>25-75</sub> in this subset suggests a more specific approach.","['75', 'FEF25', 'FEV1', 'asthma', 'asthma control', 'bronchial obstruction', 'clinical practice', 'clinical presentation', 'physical examination', 'reallife', 'spirometry']"
Progression of neuroimaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease in older adults: A 6-year follow-up study.,"We investigated progression and interrelationships of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) markers. This population-based cohort study included 325 participants (age ≥ 60 years) who had repeated measures of cSVD markers over 6 years: white-matter hyperintensity (WMH), perivascular spaces (PVS), lacunes, and grey-matter (GM) and ventricular volumes. We found that all cSVD markers, except PVS, progressed faster with increasing age. Regional WMH progressed faster in males and less-educated people (p < 0.05). Each 10-point increment in global WMH score was associated with multi-adjusted hazard ratio of 1.78 (95% CI = 1.50‒2.10) for incident lacunes and multi-adjusted β-coefficients of 0.15 (0.08-0.22), -0.37 (-0.58‒-0.16), and 0.11 (0.03‒0.18) for annual changes of global WMH score, GM volume, and ventricular volume, respectively. The corresponding figures associated with per 10-PVS increment were 1.14 (1.01‒1.28), 0.07 (0.03‒0.11), -0.18 (-0.32‒-0.04), and 0.02 (-0.03‒0.07). Prevalent lacunes were related to multi-adjusted β-coefficients of 0.29 (0.00‒0.58), 0.22 (0.05‒0.38), 0.10 (0.01‒0.18), and -0.93 (-1.83‒-0.03) for annual changes of global, deep, and periventricular WMH scores and GM volume, respectively. These results suggest that cSVD progresses faster in older, male, and less-educated people, and that greater loads of WMH, PVS, and lacunes anticipate faster cSVD progression.","['Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Cohort study', 'Demographic factors', 'Magnetic resonance imaging']"
The effect of peer support in diabetes self-management education on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Diabetes self-management education (DSME) programs are a strategy to maintain healthy behaviors. Nevertheless, limited evidence has been reported from systematic evaluations of the effects of DSME integrated with peer support on glycemic control. This study aimed to review the effectiveness of DSME interventions integrated with peer support on glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.A systematic search was carried out in electronic databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, ProQuest, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Google Scholar, for English-language articles published from 2005 until 2020. The effect size was estimated as the standard mean difference (SMD). The Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool was employed to assess the risk of bias.Twelve studies were included in this study. DSME integrated with peer support effectively reduced glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, with a statistically significant effect (SMD, -0.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.69 to -0.13; p<0.001). Programs with a sample size <100 (SMD, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.79 to -0.11; p=0.009), duration of intervention ≤6 months (SMD, -0.52; 95% CI, -0.96 to -0.07; p=0.020), baseline HbA1c <8.5% (SMD, -0.42; 95% CI, -0.77 to -0.07; p=0.020), delivery by group (SMD, -0.28; 95% CI, -0.51 to -0.06; p=0.010), and high frequency of contact (SMD, -0.29; 95% CI, -0.48 to -0.10; p=0.003) had statistically significant effects on reducing HbA1c levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.DSME integrated with peer support effectively enhances glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. Programs with smaller participants groups, shorter interventions, weekly meetings, and closer group sessions improved glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.","['Metaanalysis', 'Peer support', 'Randomized controlled trial', 'Type 2 diabetes']"
Stroke and Alzheimer's Disease: A Mendelian Randomization Study.,"Stroke and Alzheimer's disease (AD) are common neurological diseases. Several exiting studies indicated that late onset-AD and ischemic stroke have shared genetic links. Different kinds of stroke have different mechanisms. However, it remains unclear whether there is a causal relationship between different types of strokes, including any stroke (AS), any ischemic stroke (AIS), large-artery atherosclerotic stroke (LAS), and cardio-embolic stroke (CES), and AD. Herein, we conducted several Mendelian randomization (MR) studies to explore genetically causal link of different kinds of strokes and AD. The results for inverse-variance weighted (IVW) meta-analysis (β = -0.039, OR = 0.9618, and <i>P</i>-value = 0.750) and weighted median regression (WMR) (β = -0.156, OR = 0.8556, and <i>P</i>-value = 0.274) demonstrated that AS is not causally associated with AD risk. The result of MR-Egger regression (β = -1.312, <i>P</i>-value = 0.098) and intercept term (<i>P</i>-value = 0.105) illustrated no pleiotropy in this MR study. According to the results for IVW (<i>P</i>-value = 0.305, β = -0.103, and OR = 0.9021) and WMR (<i>P</i>-value = 0.487, β = -0.092, and OR = 0.9121) in the MR study between AIS and AD, there is no causal association between AIS and AD risk. In addition, the MR-Egger regression (<i>P</i>-value = 0.290 and β = -0.512) and intercept term (<i>P</i>-value = 0.387) showed no potential pleiotropy. LAS is not causally associated with AD risk according to the MR results (IVW: <i>P</i>-value = 0.568, β = 0.037, and OR = 1.0377; WMR: <i>P</i>-value = 0.793, β = -0.022, and OR = 0.9782). Additionally, the results of MR-Egger regression (<i>P</i>-value = 0.122 and β = -1.220) and intercept term (<i>P</i>-value = 0.110) showed no potential pleiotropy. Our results [IVW: <i>P</i>-value = 0.245, β = -0.064, and OR = 0.938; WMR: <i>P</i>-value = 0.331, β = -0.057, and OR = 0.9446; MR-Egger: <i>P</i>-value = 0.673 and β = -0.062, and intercept term (<i>P</i>-value = 0.985)] further demonstrated there is no causal link between CES and AD and no pleiotropy in this MR study. In conclusion, different types of stroke, including AS, AIS, LAS, and CES, would not be causally associated with AD risk.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'Mendelian randomization', 'different kinds of stroke', 'genomewide association study', 'pleiotropy']"
The effectiveness of vaccination to prevent the papillomavirus infection: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Our purpose was to determine the effectiveness and harms of vaccination in patients with any sexual history to prevent the prevalence of papillomavirus infection. A search strategy was conducted in the MEDLINE, CENTRAL, EMBASE and LILACS databases. Searches were also conducted in other databases and unpublished literature. The risk of bias was evaluated with the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. Analysis of fixed effects was conducted. The primary outcome was the infection by any and each human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype, serious adverse effects and short-term adverse effects. The measure of the effect was the risk difference (RD) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The planned interventions were bivalent vaccine/tetravalent/nonavalent vs. placebo/no intervention/other vaccines. We included 29 studies described in 35 publications. Bivalent HPV vaccine offers protection against HPV16 (RD -0.05, 95% CI -0.098 to -0.0032), HPV18 (RD -0.03, 95% CI -0.062 to -0.0004) and HPV16/18 genotypes (RD of -0.1, 95% CI -0.16 to -0.04). On the other side, tetravalent HPV vaccine offered protection against HPV6 (RD of -0.0500, 95% CI -0.0963 to -0.0230), HPV11 (RD -0.0198, 95% CI -0.0310 to -0.0085). Also, against HPV16 (RD of -0.0608, 95% CI -0.1126 to -0.0091) and HPV18 (RD of -0.0200, 95% CI -0.0408 to -0.0123). There was a reduction in the prevalence of HPV16, 18 and 16/18 genotypes when applying the bivalent vaccine, with no increase in adverse effects. Regarding the tetravalent vaccine, we found a reduction in the prevalence of HPV6, 11, 16 and 18 genotypes, with no increase in adverse effects.","['Human papillomavirus', 'metaanalysis', 'systematic review', 'vaccine']"
MRI helps depict clinically undetectable risk factors in advanced stage retinoblastomas.,"This study compared high-resolution MRI with histology in advanced stage retinoblastomas in which ophthalmoscopy and ultrasonography did not give an exhaustive depiction of the tumour and/or its extension. MRI of orbits and head in 28 retinoblastoma patients (28 eyes) treated with primary enucleation were evaluated. Iris neoangiogenesis, infiltrations of optic nerve, choroid, anterior segment and sclera suspected at MR and histology were compared. Abnormal anterior segment enhancement (AASE) was also correlated with histologically proven infiltrations. Brain images were also evaluated. Significant values were obtained for: prelaminar optic nerve (ON) sensitivity (0.88), positive predictive value (PPV) (0.75) and negative predictive value (NPV) (0.71); post-laminar ON sensitivity (0.50), specificity (0.83), PPV (0.50) and NPV (0.83); overall choroid sensitivity (0.82), and massive choroid NPV (0.69); scleral specificity (1), and NPV (1). AASE correlated with iris neoangiogenesis in 14 out of 19 eyes, and showed significant values for: overall ON PPV (0.65), prelaminar ON sensitivity (0.65), and PPV (0.61), post-laminar ON NPV (0.64); overall choroid sensitivity (0.77), PPV (0.59) and NPV (0.73); scleral NPV (0.83); anterior segment sensitivity (1), and NPV (1). Odds ratios (OR) and accuracy were significant in scleral and prelaminar optic nerve infiltration. Brain examination was unremarkable in all cases. High-resolution MRI may add important findings to clinical evaluation of advanced stage retinoblastomas.","['magnetic resonance imaging', 'retinoblastoma']"
"Creating models for the prediction of colostrum quantity, quality, and Immunoglobulin G yield in multiparous Jersey Cows from performance in the previous lactation and environmental changes.","With multiparous Jersey cows, colostrum production seems to be variable. Due to this, we aimed to identify specific variables involved in colostrum production and quality. From 2021 to 2023, data from 28 US farms (415 multiparous Jersey cows) were used to investigate if colostrum yield, immunoglobulin G concentration (IgG, g/L), and IgG yield (g) could be predicted by farm variables and transmitting abilities. With the data collected, multiple regression equations were developed to aid in predicting colostrum yield, IgG concentration, and IgG yield. Colostrum was weighed and sampled for IgG analysis. Dairy Herd Information (DHI), calving, diet, and management information data were compiled. Days below 5°C (D <), d above 23°C (D >), and d between 5 and 23°C (D) were recorded. Transmitting abilities for milk, fat, protein, and dollars; previous lactation milk yield, fat percent, fat yield, protein percent, protein yield, previous lactation somatic cell score, previous lactation d open, previous lactation d dry, previous lactation d in milk, and previous parity; current lactation parity, d dry, and calving information, birth ordinal d, and latitude were evaluated. Colostrum yield, IgG yield, and concentration had 1 added to correct for values = 0. After addition, values >0 were transformed to ln or log<sub>10</sub>. Non-transformed variables were also used to develop the model. Variance inflation factor analysis was conducted, followed by backward elimination. The log<sub>10</sub> colostrum yield model (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.55; β in parentheses) included herd size (-0.0001), ordinal d (-0.001), Ln ordinal d (0.07), latitude (-0.02), dry period length (0.004), D < (-0.005), D (-0.003), time to harvest (0.05), Ln time to harvest (-0.35), IgG (-0.004), log<sub>10</sub> IgG (0.46), feedings/d (0.06), Ln pasture access (-0.13), and Ln previous lactation d open (0.14). The model showed that previous lactation d open contributed the most toward increasing and latitude contributed the most toward decreasing colostrum yield. The IgG model (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.21) included herd size (0.02), D > (0.38), Ln time to harvest (-19.42), colostrum yield (-4.29), Ln diet type (18.00), Ln previous lactation fat percent (74.43), and previous parity (5.72). The model showed that previous lactation milkfat percent contributed the most toward increasing and time from parturition to colostrum harvest contributed the most toward decreasing colostrum IgG concentration. The log<sub>10</sub> IgG yield model (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.79) included Ln ordinal d (0.03), time to harvest (-0.01), colostrum yield (-0.11), Ln colostrum yield (1.20), Ln pasture access (-0.09), Ln previous lactation fat percent (0.53), and previous parity (0.02). The model showed that colostrum yield contributed the most toward increasing IgG yield, followed by previous lactation milkfat percent. Pasture access contributed the most toward decreasing IgG yield, though the contribution is very small. These models were validated using 39 samples from 22 farms. Actual minus predicted colostrum yield and IgG concentration and yield were 0.89 kg, -21.10 g/L, and -65.15 g respectively. These models indicate that dry period management and cow information can predict colostrum yield, and IgG concentration and yield.","['IgG concentration', 'IgG yield', 'colostrum yield', 'prediction model']"
The role of epicardial and pericoronary adipose tissue radiomics in identifying patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction from unstable angina.,"This study aimed to ascertain if the radiomics features of epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) and pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT) based on coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) could identify non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) from unstable angina (UA).This retrospective case-control study included 108 patients with NSTEMI and 108 controls with UA. All patients were separated into training cohort (n = 116), internal validation cohort 1 (n = 50), and internal validation cohort 2 (n = 50) based on the time order of admission. The internal validation cohort 1 used the same scanner and scan parameters as the training cohort, while the internal validation cohort 2 used different canners and scan parameters than the training cohort. The EAT and PCAT radiomics features selected by maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were adopted to build logistic regression models. Finally, we developed an EAT radiomics model, three vessel-based (right coronary artery [RCA], left anterior descending artery [LAD], and left circumflex artery [LCX]) PCAT radiomics models, and a combined model by combining the three PCAT radiomics models. Discrimination, calibration, and clinical application were employed to assess the performance of all models.Eight radiomics features of EAT, sixteen of RCA-PCAT, fifteen of LAD-PCAT, and eighteen of LCX-PCAT were selected and used to construct radiomics models. The area under the curves (AUCs) of the EAT, RCA-PCAT, LAD-PCAT, LCX-PCAT and the combined models were 0.708 (95% CI: 0.614-0.802), 0.833 (95% CI:0.759-0.906), 0.720 (95% CI:0.628-0.813), 0.713 (95% CI:0.619-0.807), 0.889 (95% CI:0.832-0.946) in the training cohort, 0.693 (95% CI:0.546-0.840), 0.837 (95% CI: 0.729-0.945), 0.766 (95% CI: 0.625-0.907), 0.675 (95% CI: 0.521-0.829), 0.898 (95% CI: 0.802-0.993) in the internal validation cohort 1, and 0.691 (0.535-0.847), 0.822 (0.701-0.944), 0.760 (0.621-0.899), 0.674 (0.517-0.830), 0.866 (0.769-0.963) in the internal validation cohort 2, respectively.Compared with the RCA-PCAT radiomics model, the EAT radiomics model had a limited ability to discriminate between NSTEMI and UA. The combination of the three vessel-based PCAT radiomics may have the potential to distinguish between NSTEMI and UA.","['Adipose tissue', 'Coronary computed tomography angiography', 'Myocardial infarction', 'Radiomics', 'Unstable angina']"
Implementation and Evaluation of Resuscitation Training for Childcare Workers.,"Children spend a large amount of time in daycare centers or schools. Therefore, it makes sense to train caregivers well in first-aid measures in children. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether a multimodal resuscitation training for childcare workers can teach adherence to resuscitation guidelines in a sustainable way.Caregivers at a daycare center who had previously completed a first-aid course received a newly developed multimodal resuscitation training in small groups of 7-8 participants by 3 AHA certified PALS instructors and providers. The 4-h focused retraining consisted of a theoretical component, expert modeling, resuscitation exercises on pediatric manikins (Laerdal Resusci Baby QCPR), and simulated emergency scenarios. Adherence to resuscitation guidelines was compared before retraining, immediately after training, and after 6 months. This included evaluation of chest compressions per round, chest compression rate, compression depth, full chest recoil, no-flow time, and success of rescue breaths. For better comparability and interpretation of the results, the parameters were evaluated both separately and summarized in a resuscitation score reflecting the overall adherence to the guidelines.A total of 101 simulated cardiopulmonary resuscitations were evaluated in 39 participants. In comparison to pre-retraining, chest compressions per round (15.0 [10.0-29.0] vs. 30.0 [30.0-30.0], <i>p</i> < 0.001), chest compression rate (100.0 [75.0-120.0] vs. 112.5 [105-120.0], <i>p</i> < 0.001), correct compression depth (6.7% [0.0-100.0] vs. 100.0% [100.0-100.0], <i>p</i> < 0.001), no-flow time (7.0 s. [5.0-9.0] vs. 4.0 s. [3.0-5.0], <i>p</i> < 0.001), success of rescue breaths (0.0% [0.0-0.0] vs. 100.0% [100.0-100.0], <i>p</i> < 0.001), and resuscitation score were significantly improved immediately after training (3.9 [3.2-4.9] vs. 6.3 [5.6-6.7], <i>p</i> < 0.001). At follow-up, there was no significant change in chest compression rate and success of rescue breaths. Chest compressions per round (30.0 [15.0-30.0], <i>p</i> < 0.001), no-flow time (5.0 s. [4.0-8.0], <i>p</i> < 0.001), compression depths (100.0% [96.7-100.0], <i>p</i> < 0.001), and resuscitation score worsened again after 6 months (5.7 [4.7-6.4], <i>p</i> = 0.03). However, the results were still significantly better compared to pre-retraining.Our multimodal cardiopulmonary resuscitation training program for caregivers is effective to increase the resuscitation performance immediately after training. Although the effect diminishes after 6 months, adherence to resuscitation guidelines was significantly better than before retraining.","['basic life support', 'daycare', 'emergency', 'kindergarten', 'pediatric critical care', 'pediatric outofhospital cardiac arrest', 'resuscitation']"
Detection of locally radio-recurrent prostate cancer at multiparametric MRI: Can dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging be omitted?,"The goal of this study was to assess the added value of dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging in detecting locally radio-recurrent prostate cancer using multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) at 3Tesla (T).We retrospectively analyzed 45 patients with rising prostate-specific antigen level after prostate radiotherapy who underwent mpMRI [T2-weighted (T2w), diffusion-weighted (Dw) and DCE imaging] at 3T before prostate biopsy. Four readers assigned a 5-level Likert score of cancer likelihood in 8 prostate sectors (6 sextants, 2 seminal vesicles) on T2w+Dw and T2w+Dw+DCE images. Biopsy results were used as the standard of reference.T2w+Dw and T2w+Dw+DCE imaging had similar areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves on per-sector (0.87-0.89 vs. 0.87-0.89; P=0.19-0.78) and per-lobe (0.82-0.94 vs. 0.80-0.91; P=0.21-0.84) analysis. Using a Likert score≥2/5 for diagnosis threshold, T2w+Dw+DCE imaging showed non-significantly higher sensitivities on per-sector (0.56-0.72 vs. 0.52-0.73, P=0.34-0.69) and per-lobe (0.80-0.90 vs. 0.73-0.88; P=0.63-0.99) analysis. It also showed non-significantly lower specificities on per-sector (0.74-0.89 vs. 0.82-0.89; P=0.09-0.99) and per-lobe (0.48-0.81 vs. 0.61-0.84; P=0.10-0.99) analysis. Weighted kappa values were respectively 0.57-0.70 and 0.55-0.66 for T2w+Dw and T2w+Dw+DCE imaging at the sector level, and 0.66-0.83 and 0.58-0.85 at the lobe level.The use of DCE MR imaging tends to increase sensitivity and decrease specificity for all readers, but the differences are not significant.","['Dynamic contrastenhanced MRI', 'Multiparametric MRI', 'Neoplasm recurrence', 'Prostatic neoplasms', 'Radiotherapy']"
The moderating role of physical activity on the relationship between work intensity and depressive symptoms among the employees.,"Our aim was to examine the associations between work intensity and depressive symptoms among the working population, as well as to identify the impact of physical activity (PA) on these relationships. Spearman correlation analysis was conducted to analyze the correlations among work intensity, PA, and depressive symptoms. Working hours and working days were positively correlated with depressive symptoms (<i>r</i> = 0.108, 0.063; <i>all p</i> values were <0.001). Regular PA, exercise time, exercise frequency, and exercise years were negatively correlated with depressive symptoms (<i>r</i> = -0.121, -0.124, -0.152, -0.149; all <i>p</i> values were <0.001) and working days (<i>r</i> = -0.066, -0.050, -0.069, -0.044; all <i>p</i> values were <0.001)<i>,</i> working hours (<i>r</i> = -0.113. -0.106, -0.161, -0.123; all <i>p</i> values were <0.001). Working days was positively correlated with working hours (<i>r</i> = 0.512, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Different levels of PA alleviated the effect of working hours or working days on depressive symptoms. Working hours seemed to be more correlated with depressive symptoms than working days. The results suggest that PA at any level could buffer against the effects of work intensity and might prove a helpful strategy for improving mental health issues among employees.","['Depressive symptoms', 'Employee', 'Physical activity', 'Work intensity', 'Working days', 'Working hours']"
Profiling Cognitive Deficits in Intra-Axial and Extra-Axial Tumors Using Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination as a Screening Tool: An Indian Experience.,"Tumors of the brain, whether intra- or extra-axial, results in cognitive deficits. The aim of the present study was to profile cognitive deficits using Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Malayalam (ACE-M) as a screen and to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the same.Seventy-four drug naïve patients diagnosed to have brain tumors were assessed for cognitive functioning using ACE-M before surgery.Patients with high-grade intra-axial tumors showed a significant association on the cognitive domains of registration (0.04), recall (0.01), and visuospatial functioning (0.02). Gender showed an association between registration (0.02) and verbal fluency (0.02) with females performing better while education was significantly associated with retrograde or remote memory (0.00) with college-educated sample performing better. Significance was assumed at <i>P</i> < 0.05. In extra-axial tumors, laterality had a single association with recall (0.02). Males showed a significant cognitive decline on the cognitive domains of attention (0.02), recall (0.05), naming (0.02), and language functions (0.01). College educated group performed better on registration (0.01), recall (0.09), naming (0.00), and visuospatial functioning (0.00). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was estimated as 0.75, which indicates fairly good discriminative ability with a cut off of 71/100; sensitivity at 77.3 and specificity fixed at 67.ACE-M is capable of bringing out cognitive deficits along with a number of cognitive domains in patients with intra- and extra-axial tumors in the capacity of a screen, with fairly good levels of sensitivity and specificity.","['Addenbrookes Cognitive Examination', 'cognitive deficits', 'intra and extraaxial tumors']"
The association between diet quality index-international and inflammatory markers in Iranian overweight and obese women.,"The present study was conducted to evaluate whether there is a link between the diet quality index (DQI) and markers of systemic inflammation in Iranian overweight and obese women.This cross-sectional study included 200 Iranian overweight and obese women aged 18-48 years. The DQI-international (DQI-I) comprises four main components: variety, adequacy, moderation, and overall balance. Blood samples were collected in a fasted state to measure inflammatory markers.After adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, total energy intake, economic status, education, supplement intake, age of starting obesity, and history of body mass loss, a marginally significant negative association was observed between the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and the DQI-I (β: -0.015, 95% CI: -0.03, 0.000; <i>p</i> = 0.061). The results after adjustment showed that DQI-I has a negative association with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) concentrations (β: -0.031, 95% CI: -0.104, -0.031; <i>p</i> = 0.023). Furthermore, negative associations were observed between the adequacy component and levels of HOMA-IR (β: -0.025, 95% CI: -0.100, 0.047, <i>p</i> = 0.050) and hs-CRP (β: -0.615, 95% CI: -1.191, -0.020; <i>p</i> = 0.045). In addition, negative associations were found between transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and balance score (β: -6.270, 95% CI: -39.211, -3.661, <i>p</i> = 0.020), as well as HOMA-IR (β: -0.080, 95% CI: -0.202, -0.000, <i>p</i> = 0.041) and chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) (β: -0.562, 95% CI: -11.414, -0.282, <i>p</i> = 0.021), with the various component. A marginally significant negative association between galectin 3 (Gal-3) and moderation score (β: -0.451, 95% CI: -1.171, 0.060, <i>p</i> = 0.060) was found. In addition, a marginally significant inverse association was also established between hs-CRP and variety score (β: -0.311, 95% CI: -0.970, 0.001, <i>p</i> = 0.052). The Receiver Operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that DQI-I might better predict HOMA-IR with a cut point of 3.13 (AUC = 0.698, 0.511-0.699, <i>p</i> = 0.050).These findings showed that a higher adherence to diet quality and its components could probably be related to lowering the inflammatory markers considerably in overweight and obese women.","['diet quality indexinternational DQII', 'inflammatory markers', 'obese', 'overweight', 'women']"
Predicting Mortality and Adverse Outcomes: Comparing the Frailty Index to General Prognostic Indices.,"Mortality prediction models are useful to guide clinical decision-making based on prognosis. The frailty index, which allows prognostication and personalized care planning, has not been directly compared with validated prognostic models.To compare the discrimination of mortality, disability, falls, and hospitalization between a frailty index and validated prognostic indices.Secondary Analysis of the National Health and Aging Trends Study.Seven thousand thirty-three Medicare beneficiaries 65 years or older.We measured a deficit-accumulation frailty index, Schonberg index, and Lee index at the 2011 baseline assessment. Primary outcome was mortality at 5 years. Secondary outcomes were decline in activities of daily living (ADL), decline in instrumental activities of daily living (IADL), fall, and hospitalization at 1 year. We used C-statistics to compare discrimination between indices, adjusting for age and sex.The study population included 4146 (44.8%) with age ≥ 75 years, with a median frailty index of 0.15 (interquartile range 0.09-0.25). A total of 1385 participants died (14.7%) and 2386 (35.2%) were lost to follow-up. Frailty, Schonberg, and Lee indices predicted mortality similarly: C-statistics (95% confidence interval) were 0.78 (0.77-0.80) for frailty index; 0.79 (0.78-0.81) for Schonberg index; and 0.78 (0.77-0.80) for Lee index. The frailty index had higher C-statistics for decline in ADL function (frailty index, 0.80 [0.78-0.83]; Schonberg, 0.74 [0.72-0.76]; Lee, 0.74 [0.71-0.77]) and falls (frailty index, 0.66 [0.65-0.68]; Schonberg, 0.61 [0.58-0.63]; Lee, 0.61 [0.59-0.63]). C-statistics were similar for decline in IADL function (frailty index, 0.61 [0.59-0.63]; Schonberg, 0.60 [0.59-0.62]; Lee, 0.60 [0.58-0.62]) and hospitalizations (frailty index, 0.68 [0.66-0.70]; Schonberg, 0.68 [0.66-0.69]; Lee, 0.65 [0.63-0.67]).A deficit-accumulation frailty index performs as well as prognostic indices for mortality prediction, and better predicts ADL disability and falls in community-dwelling older adults. Frailty assessment offers a unifying approach to risk stratification for key health outcomes relevant to older adults.","['disability', 'frailty', 'mortality', 'prediction', 'prognostication']"
How current biologic therapies affect the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with plaque psoriasis? A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Concerns have been raised about an increased risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) - stroke, myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death - in patients with plaque psoriasis receiving biologic therapies.This review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was to evaluate the risk difference of MACEs between experimental and comparator interventions.We searched MEDLINE database for suitable trials. Prior to that we identified the search strategy and eligibility criteria. Each RCT was double-blind, placebo controlled and scored five points in Jadad scale. We calculated risk difference (RD) with use of the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and calculated i2 statistic to assess heterogeneity. A total of 43 RCTs were included, involving 19,161 patients. Overall, the risk of MACEs in the included studies was 0.1% (<i>n</i> = 21).There were no statistically significant risk differences in patients treated with biologic therapy vs. placebo (<i>RD</i> = 0.0; <i>Z</i> = 1.09; 95% CI: 0.0-0.0; <i>p</i> = 0.28); tumour necrosis inhibitors vs. placebo (<i>RD</i> = 0.0; <i>Z</i> = 0.47; 95% CI: -0.0-0.0; <i>p</i> = 0.64); anti-IL-17A agents vs. placebo (<i>RD</i> = 0.0; <i>Z</i> = 1.25; 95% CI: -0.0-0.01; <i>p</i> = 0.21); anti-IL-23 agents vs. placebo (<i>RD</i> = 0; <i>Z</i> = 0.36; 95% CI: -0.0-0.01; <i>p</i> = 0.72); anti-IL-12/23 agents vs. placebo (<i>RD</i> = 0.0; <i>Z</i> = 0.73; 95% CI: -0.0-0.0; <i>p</i> = 0.46).Further trials are needed, including longer follow-up and patients with an increased cardiovascular risk, to assess the risk of MACEs.","['biologic therapies', 'major adverse cardiac events', 'psoriasis']"
The relationship between hypertension and anxiety or depression in Hong Kong Chinese.,"Psychosocial stress can be the cause or the consequence of hypertension.To study the association between hypertension and anxiety or depression in adults from Hong Kong, China.Patients with diagnosed hypertension (n=197) were recruited to complete the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) questionnaire. The control group comprised 182 normotensive subjects recruited using random telephone numbers.The score in the anxiety subscale (HADS-A) of the HADS correlated with age (r= -0.23, P<0.001) and sex (r=0.11, P=0.042), and was found to be higher in women. The score in the depression subscale (HADS-D) correlated with age (r=0.17, P=0.003) and hypertension (r=0.12, P=0.039), but not with sex (r=0.02, P=0.68). When the control subjects were matched for sex and age with the subjects with hypertension, the mean HADS-A score was 5.51+/-0.41 in 113 hypertensive subjects and 4.38+/-0.39 in 113 normotensive subjects (P=0.047). The mean HADS-D score was 5.56+/-0.39 in the hypertensive and 4.76+/-0.32 in the normotensive subjects (P=0.11). Multiple regression analysis using data from both groups indicated that the HADS-A score was related to the HADS-D score (beta=0.49, P<0.001), age (beta= -0.25, P<0.001) and sex (beta=0.12, P=0.01) (R(2)=0.28), whereas the HADS-D score was related to the HADS-A score (beta=0.48, P<0.001), age (beta=0.30, P<0.001), positive smoking status (beta=0.13, P=0.004) and lack of exercise habit (beta=0.12, P=0.008) (R(2)=0.31). Hypertension was related to waist circumference, history of parental hypertension and age (R(2)=0.38, P<0.001). Anxiety and depression scores were rejected as independent variables.Hypertension was associated with anxiety but not depression; however, age, history of parental hypertension and central obesity appeared to have a stronger association with hypertension in adults from Hong Kong.","['Anxiety', 'Blood pressure', 'Depression', 'Hypertension', 'Questionnaire', 'Telephone survey']"
"Agreement Between Retinoscopy, Autorefractometry and Subjective Refraction for Determining Refractive Errors in Congolese Children.","To assess the agreement between retinoscopy and autorefractometry and between subjective refraction and both retinoscopy and autorefractometry in Congolese children.Fifty-four children (6-17 years old) were enrolled consecutively in this cross-sectional study. Refraction was evaluated before and after cycloplegia (1% cyclopentolate) with retinoscopy and autorefractometry. Readings were compared (paired <i>t</i>-test) and agreement assessed with Bland-Altman plots. Subjective refraction was compared with the two methods to determine which one provides better reference estimates for subjective refraction.Under cycloplegia, the spherical power was comparable between retinoscopy and autorefractometry (1.12 ± 1.37 D vs 1.22 ± 1.06D, P = 0.70), cylinder power was significantly more myopic on retinoscopy than autorefractometry (0.80 ± 1.10D vs -0.62 ± 0.66, P = 0.019), and SE was greater on autorefractometry than retinoscopy (0.91 ± 1.10D vs 0.72 ± 1.00D, P = 0.014). Retinoscopy and autorefractometry overestimated the power of spherical (P = 0.022 and 0.002, respectively) and cylindrical components (all P < 0.001). There was an agreement between retinoscopy and autorefractometry in measuring spherical (bias: 0.09 ± 0.16D; limit of agreement, LoA: -0.40 to 0.22D) and cylindrical power (bias: -0.18 ± 0.20D; LoA: -0.57 to 0.21D). Subjective refraction agreed with cycloplegic retinoscopy for determining SE power (bias: 0.11D; LoA: -0.51 to 0.73D).Retinoscopy and autorefractometry can be used interchangeably in children for determining the power of spherical and cylindrical components. Cycloplegic retinoscopy is better than autorefractometry to obtain SE reference values for subjective refraction in children.","['agreement', 'autorefractometry', 'retinoscopy', 'subjective refraction']"
The effects of memantine on behavioral disturbances in patients with Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis.,"Memantine is effective in the treatment of behavioral disturbances in patients with Alzheimer's disease. It has not yet been fully determined which behavioral disturbances respond best to memantine.We conducted a meta-analysis of memantine vs control (placebo or usual care) for the treatment of individual behavioral disturbances (delusion, hallucination, agitation/aggression, dysphoria, anxiety/phobia, euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability/lability, aberrant motor activity/activity disturbances, nighttime disturbance/diurnal rhythm disturbances, and eating disturbances). Randomized controlled studies of memantine in patients with Alzheimer's disease were included in this study. To evaluate these outcomes, standardized mean difference (SMD), with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs), based upon a random-effects model was evaluated in the meta-analysis.A total of 11 studies (n=4,261; memantine vs placebo: N=4, n=1,500; memantine + cholinesterase inhibitors [M + ChEIs] vs ChEIs: N=7, n=2,761) were included in the meta-analysis. Compared to control, memantine showed significant improvement in agitation/aggression (SMD =-0.11; 95% CIs =-0.20, -0.03; <i>P</i>=0.01; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=47%), delusion (SMD =-0.12; 95% CIs =-0.18, -0.06; <i>P</i>=0.0002; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=0%), disinhibition (SMD =-0.08; 95% CIs =-0.15, -0.00; <i>P</i>=0.04; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=0%), and nighttime disturbance/diurnal rhythm disturbances (SMD =-0.10; 95% CIs =-0.18, -0.02; <i>P</i>=0.02; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=36%). Memantine was also marginally superior to control in hallucination (SMD =-0.06; 95% CIs =-0.12, 0.01; <i>P</i>=0.07; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=0%) and irritability/lability (SMD =-0.09; 95% CIs =-0.19, 0.01; <i>P</i>=0.07; <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>=42%). Memantine is similar to control in dysphoria, anxiety/phobia, euphoria, apathy, and eating disturbance.The meta-analysis suggest that memantine has benefits for the treatment of most of the behavioral disturbances in patients with Alzheimer's disease. Memantine does not deteriorate negative symptoms as behavioral disturbances in patients with Alzheimer's disease.","['Alzheimer’s disease', 'behavioral disturbances', 'memantine', 'metaanalysis']"
Smartphone AI vs. Medical Experts: A Comparative Study in Prehospital STEMI Diagnosis.,"Prehospital telecardiology facilitates early ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) detection, yet its widespread implementation remains challenging. Extracting digital STEMI biomarkers from printed electrocardiograms (ECGs) using phone cameras could offer an affordable and scalable solution. This study assessed the feasibility of this approach with real-world prehospital ECGs.Patients suspected of having STEMI by emergency medical technicians (EMTs) were identified from a policy research dataset. A deep learning-based ECG analyzer (QCG™ analyzer) extracted a STEMI biomarker (qSTEMI) from prehospital ECGs. The biomarker was compared to a group of human experts, including five emergency medical service directors (board-certified emergency physicians) and three interventional cardiologists based on their consensus score (number of participants answering ""yes"" for STEMI). Non-inferiority of the biomarker was tested using a 0.100 margin of difference in sensitivity and specificity.Among 53 analyzed patients (24 STEMI, 45.3%), the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of qSTEMI and consensus score were 0.815 (0.691-0.938) and 0.736 (0.594-0.879), respectively (<i>p</i>=0.081). Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of qSTEMI were 0.750 (0.583-0.917), 0.862 (0.690-0.966), 0.826 (0.679-0.955), and 0.813 (0.714-0.929), respectively. For the consensus score, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were 0.708 (0.500-0.875), 0.793 (0.655-0.966), 0.750 (0.600-0.941), and 0.760 (0.655-0.880), respectively. The 95% confidence interval of sensitivity and specificity differences between qSTEMI and consensus score were 0.042 (-0.099-0.182) and 0.103 (-0.043-0.250), respectively, confirming qSTEMI's non-inferiority.The digital STEMI biomarker, derived from printed prehospital ECGs, demonstrated non-inferiority to expert consensus, indicating a promising approach for enhancing prehospital telecardiology.","['ECG', 'Prehospital emergency care', 'STEMI', 'deep learning', 'emergency medical service']"
Development and validation of a deep learning model for multicategory pneumonia classification on chest computed tomography: a multicenter and multireader study.,"Accurate diagnosis of pneumonia is vital for effective disease management and mortality reduction, but it can be easily confused with other conditions on chest computed tomography (CT) due to an overlap in imaging features. We aimed to develop and validate a deep learning (DL) model based on chest CT for accurate classification of viral pneumonia (VP), bacterial pneumonia (BP), fungal pneumonia (FP), pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB), and no pneumonia (NP) conditions.In total, 1,776 cases from five hospitals in different regions were retrospectively collected from September 2019 to June 2023. All cases were enrolled according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, and ultimately 1,611 cases were used to develop the DL model with 5-fold cross-validation, with 165 cases being used as the external test set. Five radiologists blindly reviewed the images from the internal and external test sets first without and then with DL model assistance. Precision, recall, F1-score, weighted F1-average, and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the model performance.The F1-scores of the DL model on the internal and external test sets were, respectively, 0.947 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.936-0.958] and 0.933 (95% CI: 0.916-0.950) for VP, 0.511 (95% CI: 0.487-0.536) and 0.591 (95% CI: 0.557-0.624) for BP, 0.842 (95% CI: 0.824-0.860) and 0.848 (95% CI: 0.824-0.873) for FP, 0.843 (95% CI: 0.826-0.861) and 0.795 (95% CI: 0.767-0.822) for PTB, and 0.975 (95% CI: 0.968-0.983) and 0.976 (95% CI: 0.965-0.986) for NP, with a weighted F1-average of 0.883 (95% CI: 0.867-0.898) and 0.846 (95% CI: 0.822-0.871), respectively. The model performed well and showed comparable performance in both the internal and external test sets. The F1-score of the DL model was higher than that of radiologists, and with DL model assistance, radiologists achieved a higher F1-score. On the external test set, the F1-score of the DL model (F1-score 0.848; 95% CI: 0.824-0.873) was higher than that of the radiologists (F1-score 0.541; 95% CI: 0.507-0.575) as was its precision for the other three pneumonia conditions (all P values <0.001). With DL model assistance, the F1-score for FP (F1-score 0.541; 95% CI: 0.507-0.575) was higher than that achieved without assistance (F1-score 0.778; 95% CI: 0.750-0.807) as was its precision for the other three pneumonia conditions (all P values <0.001).The DL approach can effectively classify pneumonia and can help improve radiologists' performance, supporting the full integration of DL results into the routine workflow of clinicians.","['Deep learning DL', 'computed tomography CT', 'pneumonia', 'prediction']"
Causal Associations of Air Pollution With Cardiovascular Disease and Respiratory Diseases Among Elder Diabetic Patients.,"Extensive researches have linked air pollutants with cardiovascular disease (CVD) and respiratory diseases (RD), however, there is limited evidence on causal effects of air pollutants on morbidity of CVD or RD with comorbidities, particularly diabetes mellitus in elder patients. We included hospital admissions for CVD or RD among elder (≥65 years) diabetic patients between 2014 and 2019 in Beijing. A time-stratified case-crossover design based on negative-control exposure was used to assess causal associations of short-term exposure to air pollutants with CVD and RD among diabetic patients with the maximum lag of 7 days. A random forest regression model was used to calculate the contribution magnitude of air pollutants. A total of 493,046 hospital admissions were recorded. Per 10 μg/m<sup>3</sup> uptick in PM<sub>1</sub>, PM<sub>2.5</sub>, PM<sub>10</sub>, SO<sub>2</sub>, NO<sub>2</sub>, O<sub>3</sub>, and 1 mg/m<sup>3</sup> in CO was associated with 0.29 (0.05, 0.53), 0.14 (0.02, 0.26), 0.06 (0.00, 0.12), 0.36 (0.01, 0.70), 0.21 (0.02, 0.40), -0.08 (-0.25, 0.09), and 4.59 (0.56, 8.61) causal effect estimator for admission of CVD among diabetic patients, corresponding to 0.12 (0.05, 0.18), 0.09 (0.05, 0.13), 0.05, 0.23 (0.06, 0.41), 0.10 (0.02, 0.19), -0.04 (-0.06, -0.01), and 3.91(1.81, 6.01) causal effect estimator for RD among diabetic patients. The effect of gaseous pollutants was higher than particulate pollutants in random forest model. Short-term exposure to air pollution was causally associated with increased admission of CVD and RD among elder diabetic patients. Gaseous pollutants had a greater contribution to CVD and RD among elder diabetic patients.","['cardiovascular disease', 'causal inference', 'comorbidity', 'respiratory diseases']"
How does anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction affect the functioning of the brain and spinal cord? A systematic review with meta-analysis.,"To examine the effect of anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction on spinal-reflex and corticospinal excitability of the quadriceps muscle.A comprehensive electronic database search was performed to identify studies that objectively measured Hoffmann reflex to muscle response ratio, motor threshold, and motor evoked potentials after ACL reconstruction. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) were computed using a random effects meta-analysis model.A total of 13 studies were eligible for analysis. The Hoffmann reflex to muscle response ratio was significantly higher on both the reconstructed and non-reconstructed legs when compared with the healthy control leg (SMD = 0.28, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.08-0.49, p = 0.006 and SMD = 0.22, 95%CI: 0.04-0.40, p = 0.016, respectively) but did not differ between legs (SMD = 0.10, 95%CI: -0.01 to 0.21, p = 0.078). The motor threshold was significantly higher on both the reconstructed (SMD = 0.76, 95%CI: 0.40-1.12, p < 0.001) and non-reconstructed legs (SMD = 0.47, 95%CI: 0.00-0.95, p = 0.049) when compared with the legs of healthy controls. The reconstructed leg also had a higher motor threshold when compared with the non-reconstructed leg (SMD = 0.20, 95%CI: 0.06-0.34, p = 0.005). These changes were paralleled by bilateral reductions in quadriceps strength (ACL reconstructed: SMD = -0.78, 95%CI: -1.07 to -0.49, p < 0.001; non-reconstructed: SMD = -0.32, 95%CI: -0.63 to -0.01, p = 0.042) and quadriceps voluntary activation (ACL reconstructed: SMD = -0.73, 95%CI: -0.97 to -0.50, p < 0.001; non-reconstructed: SMD = -0.55, 95%CI: -0.82 to -0.27, p < 0.001) when compared with healthy controls.There is increased excitability of the spinal-reflex pathways and reduced excitability of the corticospinal pathways following ACL reconstruction. These changes are paralleled by reductions in quadriceps strength and voluntary activation, suggesting that rehabilitation interventions should focus on normalizing the excitability of neural pathways to effectively address quadriceps dysfunction after ACL reconstruction.","['ACLR', 'Cortical excitability', 'Hreflex', 'TMS', 'Transcranial magnetic stimulation']"
Crucial laboratory parameters in COVID-19 diagnosis and prognosis: An updated meta-analysis.,"Common laboratory parameters are crucial in aiding coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) case detection. This study aimed to determine the differences between laboratory parameters in (1) COVID-19 versus non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and (2) severe versus non-severe COVID-19 cases.Studies were collected until March 2020, and retrieved parameters include leukocyte, neutrophil, thrombocyte, and lymphocyte counts in addition to C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT) and D-dimer levels. In the presence of heterogeneity, the random-effect model (REM) was used instead of the fixed-effect model (FEM).Seven studies in the first analysis showed significantly lower leukocyte, neutrophil and platelet counts in COVID-19 pneumonia (SMD=-0.42, 95%CI -0.60 to -0.25, p<0.00001, SMD=-0.23, 95%CI -0.41 to -0.06, p=0.01, SMD=-0.54, 95%CI -0.91 to -0.16, p=0.0005) compared to non-COVID-19 pneumonia. Twenty-six studies in the second analysis showed significantly lower lymphocyte and thrombocyte counts (SMD=-0.56, 95%CI -0.71 to -0.40, p<0.0001, SMD=-0.32, 95%CI -0.49 to -0.15, p=0.0002) and significantly higher leukocyte, neutrophil, D-dimer, and CRP (SMD=0.31, 95%CI 0.07-0.56, p=0.01; SMD=0.44, 95%CI 0.24-0.64, p<0.0001; SMD=0.53, 95%CI 0.31-0.75, p<0.00001; SMD=0.97, 95%CI 0.70-1.24, p<0.00001) in severe COVID-19 compared to non-severe COVID-19.In conclusion, thrombocyte count is key in both diagnosis and prognosis. Low leukocyte and neutrophil counts are markers of COVID-19 infection, but contrastingly higher counts indicate progressive COVID-19. And although lymphocyte, D-dimer and CRP levels did not demonstrate diagnostic value, all indicate severity of COVID-19. Confirmation of these findings should be performed in future studies.","['COVID19', 'Diagnosis', 'Diagnóstico', 'Laboratory parameters', 'Parámetros de laboratorio', 'SARSCoV2']"
Surgical Risk Factors for Ischemic Stroke Following Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting. A Multi-Factor Multimodel Analysis.,"<b>Background:</b> Ischemic stroke after coronary artery bypass (CABG) has been often linked to aortic manipulation during surgery. <b>Objectives:</b> The objective of the study was to estimate the rate of postoperative ischemic stroke within 30 days from CABG by surgical risk factors alone or in combination. <b>Methods:</b> The multinomial propensity score for multiple treatments was used to create six models with a total of 16,255 consecutive patients undergoing isolated CABG. For each model, a different classification variable was used to stratify patients. <b>Results:</b> Balance achieved in all models was substantial, enabling unbiased estimation of the treatment estimand. Both off-pump techniques with (0.009; 95% CI 0.006-0.011) or without proximal anastomoses (0.005; 0.005-0.003), and surgery performed on the beating heart using cardiopulmonary bypass with (0.009; 0.006-0.011) or without proximal anastomoses (0.024; 0.021-0.029) showed a mean stroke estimate significantly lower than the other techniques. Off-pump surgery and on-pump surgery without an aortic cross-clamp yielded nearly equal incidences of stroke (0.012; 0.008-0.015 and 0.018; 0.012-0.023, respectively). Using an aortic cross-clamp significantly increased the stroke estimate (0.075; 0.061-0.088), whereas using a side-biting clamp did not (0.039; 0.033-0.044). The number of aortic touches (0.029; 0.026-0.031) and the number of proximal anastomoses (0.044; 0.035-0.047) did not significantly increase the incidence of stroke. <b>Conclusions:</b> Aortic cross-clamping was found to be the primary cause of post-CABG ischemic stroke. Instead, additional aortic manipulation from a side-biting clamp, on-pump surgery, multiple aortic touches, number of proximal anastomoses, and aortic cannulation were found not to increase the estimate of stroke significantly. Further research on this topic is warranted.","['aortic cannulation', 'aortic manipulation', 'coronary artery bypass—adverse effects', 'offpump artery bypass and grafting', 'proximal aortic anastomosis', 'stroke', 'surgical technique']"
Meta-Analysis of Catheter Ablation versus Medical Therapy in Patients with Atrial Fibrillation Without Heart Failure.,"Catheter ablation has shown to reduce mortality in patient with atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF) with reduced ejection fraction. Its effect on mortality in patients without HF has not been well elucidated.Thirteen randomized controlled trials encompassing 3856 patients were selected using PubMed, Embase and the CENTRAL till April 2019. Estimates were reported as random effects risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).Compared with medical therapy, catheter ablation did not reduce the risk of all-cause mortality (RR, 0.86, 95% CI, 0.62-1.19, P=0.36; I2=0), stroke (RR, 0.55, 95% CI, 0.18-1.66, P=0.29; I2=0), need for cardioversion (RR, 0.84, 95% CI, 0.66-1.08, P=0.17; I2=0) or pacemaker (RR, 0.59, 95% CI, 0.34-1.01, P=0.06; I2=0). However, ablation reduced the RR of cardiac hospitalization (0.37, 95% CI, 0.18-0.77, P=0.01; I2=86), and recurrent atrial arrhythmia (0.46, 95% CI, 0.35-0.60, P<0.001; I2=87). There were non-significant differences among treatment groups with respect to major bleeding (RR, 1.89, 95% CI, 0.59-6.08, P=0.29; I2=15), and pulmonary vein stenosis (RR, 3.00, 95% CI, 0.83-10.87, P=0.09; I2=0), but had significantly higher rates of pericardial tamponade (RR, 4.46, 95 % CI, 1.70-11.72, P<0.001; I2=0).Catheter ablation did not improve survival compared with medical therapy in patients with AF without HF. Catheter ablation reduced cardiac hospitalization and recurrent atrial arrhythmia at the expense of pericardial tamponade.","['Atrial fibrillation', 'Catheter ablation', 'Medical therapy', 'Metaanalysis']"
Associations between maternal and paternal feeding styles of infants in a racially diverse US birth cohort.,"Maternal feeding style has been associated with childhood obesity and has been the target of numerous interventions, but few studies included fathers.We assessed correlations and associations between maternal and paternal feeding style.We examined 202 mothers, fathers, and infants in Nurture, a racially diverse US cohort (2013-2017). Mothers and fathers completed the Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire when infants were 6 and 12 months. We examined unadjusted correlations using Spearman's Rho and adjusted associations using linear regressions.All feeding styles were significantly correlated. After adjustment, maternal feeding style was associated with paternal feeding style at 6 and 12 months for responsive (ß 0.31; CI 0.18, 0.45; P ≤ 0.0001 and ß 0.67; CI 0.50, 0.84; P ≤ 0.0001), restrictive (ß 0.24; CI 0.09, 0.38; P = 0.001 and ß 0.44; CI 0.29, 0.59; P ≤ 0.0001), pressuring (ß 0.46; CI 0.34, 0.58; P ≤ 0.0001 and ß 0.51; CI 0.38, 065; P ≤ 0.0001), indulgent (ß 0.36; CI 0.20, 0.52; P ≤ 0.0001 and ß 0.57; CI 0.40, 0.73; P ≤ 0.0001), and laissez-faire (ß 0.39; CI 0.24, 0.55; P ≤ 0.0001 and ß 0.55; CI 0.37, 0.72; P ≤ 0.0001).Maternal and paternal feeding styles were correlated. Associations held after adjustment, suggesting that mothers and fathers are in relative agreement in their reporting.","['birth cohort', 'infant feeding style questionnaire', 'obesity']"
Estimating trunk fat in children according to sex using basic somatic readings: an opportunity for improving evaluation among girls.,"The fat mass estimators waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) and relative fat mass-pediatric (RFMp) complement the widely accepted body mass index (BMI) in obesity evaluation.Conduct an easy appraisal of trunk fat and the cardiometabolic risk associated with pediatric obesity.A total of 472 children (39% boys in the total sample) were classified as underweight, normal weight, overweight or obese (nutritional groups, NGs) according to BMI Z-score after initial anthropometric data were obtained and ad hoc exclusion criteria were applied. WHtR and RFMp (% of total fat) were calculated for each group, associations were assessed through multiple linear regression (MLR), and differences between sexes were evaluated (medians, IQR).The mean age (mean (95% CI)) was 10.8 y (10.1-11.1). The values in the total sample were as follows: WHtR, 0.5 (0.49-0.51) and RFMp%, 32.3 (31.7-33.0). In the overweight group, the values were as follows: WHtR, 0.51 (0.50-0.52) and RFMp(%), 34.2 (33.3-35.1). In the obese group, the values were as follows: WHtR, 0.56 (0.55-0.57) and RFMp(%), 37.8 (36.9-38.6). The associations were as follows (NG; independent variables): In the NG, adjusted R<sup>2</sup> values were between 0.74 and 0.78. In the total sample, the beta coefficient was 3.36 (P < 0.001) for RFMp for girls; for waist circumference (WC), the beta coefficient was 2.97 (P < 0.001), and for WHtR the beta coefficients were - 0.01 (p < 0.001) and 0.03 (p < 0.001),for girls and for WC respectively. The sex differences were as follows: BMI exhibited no differences in the NG (Mann-Whitney U). WHtR (median (IQR)) differed (M vs. F) in the total sample (0.49 (0.45-0.54) vs. 0.52 (0.45-0.56), p < 0.004); in the overweight group (0.51 (0.48-0.53) vs. 0.54 (0.51-0.55), p < 0.001); and in the obese group (0.55 (0.52-0.57) vs. 0.57 (0.54-0.60), p < 0.004). RFMp (%) differed in the total group (29.21 (24.27-32.92) vs. 36.63 (30.2-39.51), p < 0.001); in the overweight group (31.24 (28.35-32.35) vs. 37.95 (35.75-38.82), p < 0.001) and in the obese group (35.89 (32.05-36.15) vs. 40.63 (38.27-42.42), p < 0.001).WHtR and RFMp are simple and reliable indices that do not require centile charts. Their values, including waist circumference, can be used to estimate the different trunk fat components in boys and girls better than BMI, especially if individuals are overweight or obese. RFMp proved to be more reliable as it considers sex. Both should be included in routine anthropometric readings.","['Abdominal fat', 'Easy anthropometry', 'Pediatric obesity', 'Sex distribution']"
Comparison of emergency department trauma triage performance of clinicians and clinical prediction models: a cohort study in India.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the abilities of clinicians and clinical prediction models to accurately triage emergency department (ED) trauma patients. We compared the decisions made by clinicians with the Revised Trauma Score (RTS), the Glasgow Coma Scale, Age and Systolic Blood Pressure (GAP) score, the Kampala Trauma Score (KTS) and the Gerdin <i>et al</i> model.Prospective cohort study.Three hospitals in urban India.In total, 7697 adult patients who presented to participating hospitals with a history of trauma were approached for enrolment. The final study sample included 5155 patients. The majority (4023, 78.0%) were male.The patient outcome was mortality within 30 days of arrival at the participating hospital. A grid search was used to identify model cut-off values. Clinicians and categorised models were evaluated and compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROCC) and net reclassification improvement in non-survivors (NRI+) and survivors (NRI-) separately.The differences in AUROCC between each categorised model and the clinicians were 0.016 (95% CI -0.014 to 0.045) for RTS, 0.019 (95% CI -0.007 to 0.058) for GAP, 0.054 (95% CI 0.033 to 0.077) for KTS and -0.007 (95% CI -0.035 to 0.03) for Gerdin <i>et al</i>. The NRI+ for each model were -0.235 (-0.37 to -0.116), 0.17 (-0.042 to 0.405), 0.55 (0.47 to 0.65) and 0.22 (0.11 to 0.717), respectively. The NRI- were 0.385 (0.348 to 0.4), -0.059 (-0.476 to -0.005), -0.162 (-0.18 to -0.146) and 0.039 (-0.229 to 0.06), respectively.The findings of this study suggest that there are no substantial differences in discrimination and net reclassification improvement between clinicians and all four clinical prediction models when using 30-day mortality as the outcome of ED trauma triage in adult patients.ClinicalTrials.gov Registry (NCT02838459).","['accident  emergency medicine', 'epidemiology', 'trauma management']"
Diagnostic Utility of High Sensitivity Troponins for Echocardiographic Markers of Structural Heart Disease.,"The conventional use of high-sensitivity troponins (hs-troponins) is for diagnosing myocardial infarction however they also have a role in chronic disease management. This pilot study assessed the relationship of hs-troponins with echocardiographic markers of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and structural heart disease (SHD). Patients undergoing computer gomography (CT) coronary angiogram for low-intermediate risk chest pain and healthy volunteers were recruited. Hs-troponins Singulex I, Abbott I and Roche T and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) were evaluated in relation to SHD parameters including left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH<sub>Echo</sub>) and left atrial enlargement (LAE<sub>Echo</sub>) on echocardiography. 78 subjects who underwent echocardiography were included in this study. C-statistics (95% confidence interval) of the four biomarkers for predicting LVH<sub>Echo</sub> were 0.84 (0.72-0.92), 0.84 (0.73-0.92), 0.75 (0.63-0.85) and 0.62 (0.49-0.74); for LAE<sub>Echo</sub> 0.74 (0.6-0.85), 0.78 (0.66-0.88), 0.55 (0.42-0.67) and 0.68 (0.62-0.85); and composite SHD 0.79 (0.66-0.88), 0.87 (0.75-0.94), 0.62 (0.49-0.73) and 0.74 (0.62-0.84) respectively. Optimal cut points for SHD were >1.2 ng/L, >1.6 ng/L, >8 ng/L and >18 pmol/L respectively. These results advocate the potential role of hs-troponins as screening tools for structural heart disease with theranostic implications.","['echocardiography', 'left ventricular hypertrophy', 'structural heart disease', 'troponin']"
A strategic study of acupuncture for diabetic kidney disease based on meta-analysis and data mining.,"The specific benefit and selection of acupoints in acupuncture for diabetic kidney disease (DKD) remains controversial. This study aims to explore the specific benefits and acupoints selection of acupuncture for DKD through meta-analysis and data mining.Clinical trials of acupuncture for DKD were searched in eight common databases. Meta-analysis was used to evaluate its efficacy and safety, and data mining was used to explore its acupoints selection.Meta-analysis displayed that compared with the conventional drug group, the combined acupuncture group significantly increased the clinical effective rate (risk ratio [RR] 1.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20 to 1.51, P < 0.00001) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (mean difference [MD] 0.36, 95% CI 0.27 to 0.46, P < 0.00001), significantly reduced the urinary albumin (MD -0.39, 95% CI -0.42 to -0.36, P < 0.00001), urinary microalbumin (MD -32.63, 95% CI -42.47 to -22.79, P < 0.00001), urine β2-microglobulin (MD -0.45, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.24, P < 0.0001), serum creatinine (MD -15.36, 95% CI -21.69 to -9.03, P < 0.00001), glycated hemoglobin A1c (MD -0.69, 95% CI -1.18 to -0.19, P = 0.006), fasting blood glucose (MD -0.86, 95% CI -0.90 to -0.82, P < 0.00001), 2h postprandial plasma glucose (MD -0.87, 95% CI -0.92 to -0.82, P < 0.00001), total cholesterol (MD -1.23, 95% CI -2.05 to -0.40, P = 0.003), triglyceride (MD -0.69, 95% CI -1.23 to -0.15, P = 0.01), while adverse events were comparable. Data mining revealed that CV12, SP8, SP10, ST36, SP6, BL20, BL23, and SP9 were the core acupoints for DKD treated by acupuncture.Acupuncture improved clinical symptoms, renal function indices such as uALB, umALB, uβ2-MG, and SCR, as well as blood glucose and blood lipid in patients with DKD, and has a favorable safety profile. CV12, SP8, SP10, ST36, SP6, BL20, BL23, and SP9 are the core acupoints for acupuncture in DKD, and this program is expected to become a supplementary treatment for DKD.","['acupoint', 'acupuncture', 'data mining', 'diabetic kidney disease', 'metaanalysis']"
"FibroScan-aspartate aminotransferase (FAST) score for monitoring histological improvement in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis activity during semaglutide treatment: post-hoc analysis of a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial.","Currently, assessment of candidate pharmacotherapies in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) involves invasive liver biopsy. Non-invasive scores, such as the FibroScan-aspartate aminotransferase (FAST) score, are used to identify candidates for therapy, but their ability to assess disease progression or treatment effect is unknown. We aimed to assess the association between FAST score and histological endpoints.We conducted a post-hoc analysis using data from a prior randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial at 143 sites across 16 countries. Patients (aged 18-75 years) with biopsy-confirmed NASH, fibrosis stage 1-3, and a Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Activity Score (NAS) ≥4 were enrolled between January 2017 and September 2018, and randomly assigned to receive once-daily subcutaneous semaglutide 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mg or placebo for 72 weeks. A subgroup analysis of patients with FAST score and histological data in the pooled semaglutide treatment and placebo arms at baseline and week 72 was performed. The original trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02970942.A total of 122 patients were included in this post-hoc analysis (93 received semaglutide and 29 received placebo). FAST score reduction was associated with achieving the primary endpoint of NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis in the pooled semaglutide group (area under the receiver operating curve 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58, 0.81). Mean FAST score reduction from baseline to week 72 was greatest in patients who met the primary endpoint <i>vs</i> those who did not in both the semaglutide (-0.40 [95% CI -0.84, 0.04] <i>vs</i> -0.22 [95% CI -0.74, 0.30] points; p = 0.002) and placebo groups (-0.25 [95% CI -0.72, 0.23] <i>vs</i> 0.00 [95% CI -0.50, 0.50] points; p = 0.047). Similarly, mean reductions in FAST score at week 72 were greater in those with NAS improvement <i>vs</i> those without in the semaglutide and placebo groups (≥1 point, -0.36 [95% CI -0.82, 0.11] <i>vs</i> -0.08 [95% CI -0.53, 0.38] points [p < 0.001] and -0.25 [95% CI -0.64, 0.14] <i>vs</i> -0.06 [95% CI -0.40, 0.53] points [p = 0.001]; ≥2 points, -0.40 [95% CI -0.86, 0.06] <i>vs</i> -0.14 [95% CI -0.56, 0.28] points [p < 0.001] and -0.29 [95% CI -0.67, 0.09] <i>vs</i> -0.05 [95% CI -0.40, 0.50] points; [p < 0.001]). A FAST score reduction of more than 0.22 points after semaglutide treatment was associated with meeting the primary endpoint (sensitivity 78%; specificity 60%; positive likelihood ratio 1.26; negative likelihood ratio 0.25; odds ratio 4.93).The potential of the FAST score as a non-invasive monitoring tool to identify histological changes following treatment requires further evaluation and validation.Novo Nordisk A/S.","['Biomarkers', 'Clinical trial', 'NASH', 'Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'Semaglutide']"
Towards a point-of-care multimodal spectroscopy instrument for the evaluation of human cardiac tissue.,"To demonstrate that point-of-care multimodal spectroscopy using Near-Infrared (NIR) and Raman Spectroscopy (RS) can be used to diagnose human heart tissue. We generated 105 spectroscopic scans, which comprised 4 NIR and 3 RS scans per sample to generate a ""multimodal spectroscopic scan"" (MSS) for each heart, done across 15 patients, 5 each from the dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), Ischaemic Heart Disease (IHD) and Normal pathologies. Each of the MSS scans was undertaken in 3 s. Data were entered into machine learning (ML) algorithms to assess accuracy of MSS in diagnosing tissue type. The median age was 50 years (IQR 49-52) for IHD, 47 (IQR 45-50) for DCM and 36 (IQR 33-52) for healthy patients (p = 0.35), 60% of which were male. MSS identified key differences in IHD, DCM and normal heart samples in regions typically associated with fibrosis and collagen (NIR wavenumbers: 1433, 1509, 1581, 1689 and 1725 nm; RS wavelengths: 1658, 1450 and 1330 cm<sup>-1</sup>). In principal component (PC) analyses, these differences explained 99.2% of the variation in 4 PCs for NIR, 81.6% in 10 PCs for Raman, and 99.0% in 26 PCs for multimodal spectroscopic signatures. Using a stack machine learning algorithm with combined NIR and Raman data, our model had a precision of 96.9%, recall of 96.6%, specificity of 98.2% and Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.989 (Table 1). NIR and Raman modalities alone had similar levels of precision at 94.4% and 89.8% respectively (Table 1). MSS combined with ML showed accuracy of 90% for detecting dilated cardiomyopathy, 100% for ischaemic heart disease and 100% for diagnosing healthy tissue. Multimodal spectroscopic signatures, based on NIR and Raman spectroscopy, could provide cardiac tissue scans in 3-s to aid accurate diagnoses of fibrosis in IHD, DCM and normal hearts.

Identifying optimal PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer in China: Updated systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"<b>Objective:</b> After Gemstone-302 was published in Lancet in January 2022, seven PD-(L)1 inhibitors launched or about to be launched in China, but there are no head-to-head RCTs reporting the comparative efficacy for squamous non-small cell lung cancer (sq-NSCLC). Therefore, we aimed to indirectly compare the efficacy of these treatments to provide evidence for clinical decision and Chinese national reimbursement drug listing. <b>Methods:</b> We collected phase III clinical trials targeted on stage IIIB-IV patients for first-line immunotherapy of sq-NSCLC by systematically searching databases. Relative effects of competing treatments were assessed by Bayesian network meta-analysis and non-parametric restricted mean survival time (RMST) model. Hazard ratio (HR), severe adverse events (SAEs, grade 3-5), progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) years were the outcomes. Subgroup analysis was done according to PD-(L)1 expression, smoking, gender, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, age and disease stage. Sensitivity analysis using the range of parameters distribution as well as different comparison methods was performed to test the robustness of the results. <b>Results:</b> A total of 7 clinical trials with 2,640 patients were included. For OS, the efficiency (HR, 95%CI) ranks from high to low were sugemalimab (0.48, 0.32-0.73), camrelizumab (0.55, 0.40-0.76), sintilimab (0.56, 0.35-0.90), pembrolizumab (0.71, 0.58-0.87) and atezolizumab (0.88, 0.73-1.05). For PFS, the efficiency ranks from high to low were sugemalimab (0.33, 0.24-0.45), camrelizumab (0.37, 0.30-0.46), tislelizumab (0.53, 0.36-0.79), sintilimab (0.54, 0.42-0.69), toripalimab (0.56, 0.38-0.83), pembrolizumab (0.57, 0.47-0.70) and atezolizumab (0.71, 0.59-0.85). Proportional hazard models and non-proportional hazard models showed consistent efficiency ranks. When extrapolated to long-term survival benefit, under non-proportional hazard ratio, sugemalimab achieved the highest PFS benefit (lifeyears, LYs) in 2 years (1.323), with camrelizumab (1.320), sintilimab (1.243), tislelizumab (1.189), pembrolizumab (0.990) and atezolizumab (0.947) ranking in order; Camrelizumab achieved the highest OS benefit (LYs) in 10 years (2.723), with atezolizumab (2.445) and pembrolizumab (2.397) ranking in order. RMST model showed similar results. In terms of safety, PD-(L)1 inhibitors increased the incidence of SAEs when combined with chemotherapy, sugemalimab and camrelizumab was the safest drugs. <b>Conclusion:</b> Sugemalimab is superior both in HR and long-term survival benefit for Chinese patients with advanced sq-NSCLC.","['NMA', 'PD1PDL1 inhibitors', 'firstline', 'nonproportional hazard models', 'squamous nonsmall cell lung cancer']"
The association of problematic smartphone use with family well-being mediated by family communication in Chinese adults: A population-based study.,"Few studies have investigated the effects of problematic smartphone use (PSU) in the family context. We studied the association of PSU as a predictor with family well-being and the potential mediating role of family communication in Hong Kong Chinese adults.We analyzed data of 5,063 randomly selected adults [mean age (<i>SD</i>) = 48.1 (18.2) years; 45.0% men] from a dual landline and mobile telephone survey in 2017. PSU was assessed by the Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version with higher scores indicating higher levels. Family well-being was assessed by three questions on perceived family health, harmony, and happiness (3Hs) with higher scores indicating greater well-being. Perceived sufficiency and quality of family communication were rated. Multivariable regression analyses examined (a) associations of PSU with family 3Hs and well-being and (b) mediating role of family communication, adjusting for sociodemographic variables.PSU was negatively associated with perceived family health (adjusted β = -0.008, 95% CI = -0.016, -0.0004), harmony (adjusted β = -0.009, 95% CI = -0.017, -0.002), happiness (adjusted β = -0.015, 95% CI = -0.022, -0.007), and well-being (adjusted β = -0.011, 95% CI = -0.018, -0.004). Perceived family communication sufficiency (adjusted β = -0.007, 95% CI = -0.010, -0.005) and quality (adjusted β = -0.009, 95% CI = -0.014, -0.005) mediated the association of PSU with family well-being, with 75% and 94% of total effects having mediated, respectively.PSU was negatively associated with family well-being, which was partially mediated by family communication. Such findings provide insights for health programs to prevent PSU and improve family well-being.","['family communication', 'family wellbeing', 'populationbased study', 'problematic smartphone use']"
Valproic acid's effects on visual acuity in retinitis pigmentosa: a systemic review and Meta-analysis.,"To gain a better understanding of the overall efficacy of valproic acid (VPA) treatment for retinitis pigmentosa (RP).Publications in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Clinicaltrials.gov were searched for clinical trials of patients with RP assigned to treatment with VPA. Patients' pre- and post-treatment visual field (VF) and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) scores were extracted and compared to assess changes.A total of 78 reports were retrieved and 6 studies involving 116 patients were included in the Meta-analysis. The combined results showed a significant decrease in logarithm of minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) scores, calculated using baseline and post-treatment BCVA (<i>P</i><0.00001, mean difference=-0.05, 95%CI: -0.05, -0.04, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>=36%) scores, which means there was considerable improvement in visual acuity. Meanwhile, more BCVA changes were observed in short-term (≤6mo) treatment studies (<i>P</i><0.00001, mean difference=-0.05, 95%CI: -0.05, -0.04, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>=38%), studies conducted in Asia (<i>P</i><0.00001, mean difference=-0.05, 95%CI: -0.05, -0.04, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>=4%), studies with a sample size of 30 or fewer patients (<i>P</i><0.00001, mean difference=-0.05, 95%CI: -0.05, -0.04, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>=38%) and prospective studies (<i>P</i><0.00001, mean difference=-0.05, 95%CI: -0.05, -0.04, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>=0%). However, VPA's effect on VF was inconsistent across studies (<i>P</i>=0.75, mean difference=-22.76, 95%CI: -160.56, 115.05, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup>=68%).This Meta-analysis reveals that most RP patients who were treated with VPA showed improvement in BCVA. However, its effect on VF remains inconsistent. VPA may be a promising treatment for RP.","['Metaanalysis', 'retinitis pigmentosa', 'valproic acid', 'visual acuity']"
Evaluation of Pollution of Soils and Particulate Matter Around Metal Recycling Factories in Southwestern Nigeria.,"Metal recycling factories (MRFs) have developed rapidly in Nigeria as recycling policies have been increasingly embraced. These MRFs are point sources for introducing potentially toxic elements (PTEs) into environmental media.The aim of this study was to determine the constituents (elemental and mineralogy) of the wastes (slag and particulate matter, (PM)) and soils around the MRFs and to determine the level of pollution within the area.Sixty samples (30 slag samples, 15 soil samples and 15 PM samples) were collected for this study. The soils, slag and PM samples were analyzed for elemental constituents using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. Mineralogy of the PM was determined using scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and soil mineralogy was determined by an X-ray diffractometer (XRD).The results of the soil analyses revealed the following concentrations for the selected metals in mg/kg include lead (Pb) (21.0-2399.0), zinc (Zn) (56.0-4188.0), copper (Cu) (10.0-1470.0), nickel (Ni) (6.0-215.0), chromium (Cr) (921.0-1737.0) and cadmium (Cd) (below detectable limit (Bdl)-18.1). For the slags the results were Pb (68.0-.333.0), Zn (1364.0-3062), Cu (119.0-1470.0), Ni (12.0-675.0), Cr (297-1737) and Cd (Bdl-15.8). The results in μg/g for the metal analysis in PM were Pb (4.6-160.0), Zn (18.0-471.0), Cu (2.5-11.0), Ni (0.8-4.2), and Cr (2.5-11.0), while Cd was undetected. The slags are currently utilized for filling the foundations of buildings and roads, providing additional pathways for the introduction of PTEs into the environment from the suspended materials generated from mechanical breakdown of the slags.The MRFs were found to have impacted the quality of environmental media through the introduction of PTEs, impairing soil quality, in addition to PM, which can have detrimental health consequences. Further studies on the health implications of these pollutants and their impacts on human health are needed.The authors declare no competing financial interests.","['metal recycling plants', 'pollution indices', 'potentially toxic elements', 'slags']"
"Interest in mammography across European countries: a retrospective ""Google Trends"" comparative study.","Breast cancer is currently the most prevalent and impacting cancer among women and mammography has been recommended for screening by The European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer since 2003. The objective of this study is to estimate the interest in breast cancer screening breast cancer in European countries by analyzing data from online searches for the term ""mammography"" obtained via Google Trends.The relative search volumes (RSVs) of the term ""mammography"" translated into various languages and relating to the January 2010-December 2022 period were downloaded from Google Trends. The between-countries differences growth of interest was estimated by a regression model in which the country-time interaction term was introduced.France [coefficient (coeff): 0.23; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.18-0.28], United Kingdom (coeff: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.18-0.27) and Germany (coeff: 0.21; 95% CI: 0.16-0.25) showed the higher growth in mammography interest when compared to the average growth. The lowest growths were observed in Eastern European countries: Croatia (coeff: -0.13; 95% CI: -0.18 to -0.09), Serbia (coeff: -0.14; 95% CI: -0.18 to -0.09), Greece (coeff: -0.14; 95% CI: -0.18 to -0.09), Slovenia (coeff: -0.15; 95% CI: -0.2 to -0.11) and Bosnia-Herzegovina (coeff: -0.15; 95% CI: -0.2 to -0.11).These exploratory findings suggest that online interest in mammography is lower in countries with lower screening coverage and higher breast cancer mortality. These countries could adopt strategies to raise awareness of breast cancer prevention.","['Google Trends', 'Mammogram', 'breast cancer', 'infodemiology', 'mammography']"
"Community home visiting services and child maltreatment report rates, Illinois zip codes, 2011-2018.","Research is sparse on the community-level impacts of home visiting programs on child maltreatment.To examine community-level associations between state-funded home visiting programs (i.e., IDHS-HV), federal-funded home visiting programs (i.e., MIECHV), and child maltreatment report (CMR) rates, overall and within subgroups of age, sex, and maltreatment type.3824 zip code-years during 2011-2018 in Illinois for IDHS-HV/CMR associations and 1896 zip code-years during 2015-2018 for MIECHV/CMR associations.We measured county-level IDHS-HV rates (per 1000 children aged 0-5) since data were only available at that level. MIECHV rates (per 1000 children aged 0-5), CMR rates (per 1000 children), and all controls were measured at the zip code level. We used spatial linear models to handle spatial autocorrelation.Adjusted for controls, longitudinal increases of IDHS-HV rates were significantly associated with decreased overall CMR rates (coefficient: -0.28; 95 % CI: -0.45, -0.11), age 0-5 CMR rates (-0.52; -0.82, -0.22), age 6-11 CMR rates (-0.31; -0.55, -0.06), male CMR rates (-0.25; -0.45, -0.05), female CMR rates (-0.29; -0.49, -0.08), and neglect report rates (-0.13; -0.24, -0.02). In contrast, longitudinal increases of MIECHV rates were significantly associated with increased CMR rates within several subgroups.Our findings suggest that increasing state-funded home visiting services in communities may have benefits in lowering their CMR rates. Given the very low MIECHV service rates and the federal policy that requires MIECHV to target at-risk communities, the significant positive MIECHV/CMR associations we found might indicate MIECHV programs are typically in higher risk communities.","['Child maltreatment', 'Child maltreatment report', 'Home visiting', 'Spatial analysis']"
Cognitive predictors of COVID-19 mitigation behaviors in vaccinated and unvaccinated general population members.,"Given the long-term threat posed by COVID-19, predictors of mitigation behaviors are critical to identify. Prior studies have found that cognitive factors are associated with some COVID-19 mitigation behaviors, but few studies employ representative samples and no prior studies have examined cognitive predictors of vaccination status. The purpose of the present study was to examine associations between cognitive variables (executive function, delay discounting, and future orientation) and COVID-19 mitigation behaviors (mask wearing, social distancing, hand hygiene and vaccination) in a population representative sample.A population representative sample of 2,002 adults completed validated measures of delay discounting, future orientation, and executive function. Participants also reported frequency of mitigation behaviors, vaccination status, and demographics.Future orientation was associated with more mask wearing (β = 0.160, 95 % CI [0.090, 0.220], p < 0.001), social distancing (β = 0.150, 95 % CI [0.070, 0.240], p < 0.001), hand hygiene behaviors (β = 0.090, 95 % CI [0.000, 0.190], p = 0.054), and a higher likelihood of being fully vaccinated (OR = 0.80, 95 % CI [0.670, 0.970], p = 0.020). Lower delay discounting predicted more consistent mask wearing (β = -0.060, 95 % CI[-0.120, -0.010], p = 0.032) and being fully vaccinated (OR = 1.28, 95 % CI [1.13, 1.44], p < 0.001), while more symptoms of executive dysfunction predicted less mask wearing (β = -0.240, 95 % CI [-0.320, -0.150] p < 0.001) and hand hygiene (β = -0.220, 95 % CI [-0.320, -0.130], p < 0.001), but not vaccination status (OR = 0.96, 95 % CI [0.80, 1.16], p = 0.690) or social distancing behaviors (β = -0.080, 95 % CI [-0.180, 0.020], p = 0.097). Overall, social distancing was the least well-predicted outcome from cognitive factors, while mask wearing was most well-predicted. Vaccination status was not a significant moderator of these effects of cognitive predictors on mitigation behaviors.Cognitive variables predict significant variability in mitigation behaviors. regardless of vaccination status. In particular, thinking about the future and discounting it less may encourage more consistent implementation of mitigating behaviors.","['COVID19', 'Executive functions', 'Mitigating behaviors', 'SARSCoV2', 'Vaccination']"
Effects of smartphone-based interventions and monitoring on bipolar disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Recently, there has been a range of studies about smartphone-based interventions and monitoring for reducing symptoms of bipolar disorder (BD). However, their efficacy for BD remains unclear.To compare the effect of smartphone-based interventions and monitoring with control methods in treating patients with BD.A systematic literature search was performed on PubMed, Embase, Clinical trials, psycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) or single-group trials in which smartphone-based interventions and monitoring were compared with control methods or baseline in patients with symptoms of BD were included. Data were synthesized using a random-effects or a fixed-effects model to analyze the effects of psychological interventions and monitoring delivered <i>via</i> smartphone on psychiatric symptoms in patients with BD. The primary outcome measures were set for mania and depression symptoms. Subgroups were created to explore which aspects of smartphone interventions are relevant to the greater or lesser efficacy of treating symptoms.We identified ten articles, including seven RCTs (985 participants) and three single-group trials (169 participants). Analysis of the between-group study showed that smartphone-based interventions were effective in reducing manic [g = -0.19, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.33 to -0.04, <i>P</i> = 0.01] and depressive (g = -0.28, 95%CI: -0.55 to -0.01, <i>P</i> < 0.05) symptoms. In within-group analysis, smartphone-based interventions significantly reduced manic (g = 0.17, 95%CI: 0.04 to 0.30, <i>P</i> < 0.01) and depressive (g = 0.48, 95%CI: 0.18 to 0.78) symptoms compared to the baseline. Nevertheless, smartphone-based monitoring systems significantly reduced manic (g = 0.27, 95%CI: 0.02 to 0.51, <i>P</i> < 0.05) but not depressive symptoms. Subgroup analysis indicated that the interventions with psychoeducation had positive effects on depressive (g = -0.62, 95%CI: -0.81 to -0.43, P < 0.01) and manic (g = -0.24, 95%CI: -0.43 to -0.06, <i>P</i> = 0.01) symptoms compared to the controlled conditions, while the interventions without psychoeducation did not (<i>P</i> > 0.05). The contacts between therapists and patients that contributed to the implementation of psychological therapy reduced depression symptoms (g = -0.47, 95%CI: -0.75 to -0.18, <i>P</i> = 0.01).Smartphone-based interventions and monitoring have a significant positive impact on depressive and manic symptoms of BD patients in between-group and within-group analysis.","['Bipolar disorder', 'Interventions', 'Metaanalysis', 'Monitoring', 'Smartphone', 'Systematic review']"
Preliminary Clinical Study of the Differences Between Interobserver Evaluation and Deep Convolutional Neural Network-Based Segmentation of Multiple Organs at Risk in CT Images of Lung Cancer.,"<b>Background:</b> In this study, publicly datasets with organs at risk (OAR) structures were used as reference data to compare the differences of several observers. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based auto-contouring was also used in the analysis. We evaluated the variations among observers and the effect of CNN-based auto-contouring in clinical applications. <b>Materials and methods:</b> A total of 60 publicly available lung cancer CT with structures were used; 48 cases were used for training, and the other 12 cases were used for testing. The structures of the datasets were used as reference data. Three observers and a CNN-based program performed contouring for 12 testing cases, and the 3D dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and mean surface distance (MSD) were used to evaluate differences from the reference data. The three observers edited the CNN-based contours, and the results were compared to those of manual contouring. A value of P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. <b>Results:</b> Compared to the reference data, no statistically significant differences were observed for the DSCs and MSDs among the manual contouring performed by the three observers at the same institution for the heart, esophagus, spinal cord, and left and right lungs. The 95% confidence interval (CI) and <i>P</i>-values of the CNN-based auto-contouring results comparing to the manual results for the heart, esophagus, spinal cord, and left and right lungs were as follows: the DSCs were CNN vs. A: 0.914~0.939(<i>P</i> = 0.004), 0.746~0.808(<i>P</i> = 0.002), 0.866~0.887(<i>P</i> = 0.136), 0.952~0.966(<i>P</i> = 0.158) and 0.960~0.972 (<i>P</i> = 0.136); CNN vs. B: 0.913~0.936 (<i>P</i> = 0.002), 0.745~0.807 (<i>P</i> = 0.005), 0.864~0.894 (<i>P</i> = 0.239), 0.952~0.964 (<i>P</i> = 0.308), and 0.959~0.971 (<i>P</i> = 0.272); and CNN vs. C: 0.912~0.933 (<i>P</i> = 0.004), 0.748~0.804(<i>P</i> = 0.002), 0.867~0.890 (<i>P</i> = 0.530), 0.952~0.964 (<i>P</i> = 0.308), and 0.958~0.970 (<i>P</i> = 0.480), respectively. The <i>P</i>-values of MSDs are similar to DSCs. The <i>P</i>-values of heart and esophagus is smaller than 0.05. No significant differences were found between the edited CNN-based auto-contouring results and the manual results. <b>Conclusion:</b> For the spinal cord, both lungs, no statistically significant differences were found between CNN-based auto-contouring and manual contouring. Further modifications to contouring of the heart and esophagus are necessary. Overall, editing based on CNN-based auto-contouring can effectively shorten the contouring time without affecting the results. CNNs have considerable potential for automatic contouring applications.","['autocontouring', 'contour variation', 'deep convolutional neural network', 'lung cancer', 'organs at risk']"
Maternal Stress During Pregnancy Is Associated with Decreased Cortisol and Cortisone Levels in Neonatal Hair.,"Hair glucocorticoids (GCs) offer a retrospective view on chronic GC exposure. We assessed whether maternal pre- and postnatal stress was associated with neonatal and maternal hair GCs postpartum (pp).On the first day pp 172 mother-infant pairs donated hair, of whom 67 had consulted a centre of expertise for psychiatric disorders during pregnancy. Maternal stress was scored on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale during the first/second (n = 46), third trimester (n = 57), and pp (n = 172). Hair cortisol and cortisone levels were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, and associations with maternal hospital anxiety subscale (HAS) and hospital depression subscale (HDS) scores, and antidepressant use were analyzed with linear regression.Neonatal hair GCs were negatively associated with elevated HAS-scores during the first/second trimester, log 10 (β [95% CI]) cortisol -0.19 (-0.39 to 0.02) p = 0.07, cortisone -0.10 (-0.25 to 0.05) p = 0.17; third trimester, cortisol -0.17 (-0.33 to 0.00) p = 0.05, cortisone -0.17 (-0.28 to -0.05) p = 0.01; and pp, cortisol -0.14 (-0.25 to -0.02) p = 0.02, cortisone -0.07 (-0.16 to 0.02) p = 0.10. A similar pattern was observed for elevated HDS-scores. Maternal hair GCs were positively associated with elevated HAS-scores pp (cortisol 0.17 [0.01 to 0.32] p = 0.04, cortisone 0.18 [0.06 to 0.31] p = 0.01), but not prenatally or with elevated HDS-scores. Antidepressant use was associated with elevated maternal hair GCs (p ≤ 0.05), but not with neonatal hair GCs.Exposure to excessive pre- and perinatal maternal stress was associated with a decrease in neonatal hair GCs, while elevated stress-scores around birth were associated with increased maternal hair GCs and elevated stress-scores earlier in gestation were not associated with maternal hair GCs pp. Further studies are needed to test associations with infant neurodevelopment.","['Early life stress', 'Hair glucocorticoids', 'In utero', 'Infant', 'newborn', 'Stress', 'psychological']"
Association of variability in body size with neuroimaging metrics of brain health: a population-based cohort study.,"The relationship between the fluctuation in body size and brain health is poorly understood. This study aimed to examine the associations of long-term variability in body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) with neuroimaging metrics that approximate brain health.This cohort study recruited 1114 participants aged 25-83 years from a multicenter, community-based cohort study in China. We modeled the BMI and WHR trajectories of participants during 2006-2018 and assessed the BMI and WHR variability (direction and speed of change) by calculating the slope. Generalized linear models were applied to investigate the associations of BMI and WHR variability with MRI markers of brain tissue volume, white matter microstructural integrity, white matter hyperintensity (WMH), and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD).Progressive weight gain during follow-up was associated with lower global fractional anisotropy (beta = -0.18, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.34 to -0.02), higher mean diffusivity (beta = 0.15, 95% CI 0.01-0.30) and radial diffusivity (beta = 0.17, 95% CI 0.02-0.32). Weight loss was also associated with a lower burden of periventricular WMH (beta = -0.26, 95% CI -0.48 to -0.03) and a lower risk of moderate-to-severe basal ganglia enlarged perivascular spaces (BG-EPVS, odds ratio [OR] = 0.41, 95% CI 0.20-0.83). Among overweight populations, weight loss was linked with smaller volumes of WMH (beta = -0.47, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.15), periventricular WMH (beta = -0.57, 95% CI -0.88 to -0.26), and deep WMH (beta = -0.36, 95% CI -0.69 to -0.03), as well as lower risk of CSVD (OR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.08-0.62), lacune (OR = 0.12, 95% CI 0.01-0.91) and moderate-to-severe BG-EPVS (OR = 0.24, 95% CI 0.09-0.61). In adults with central obesity, WHR loss was positively associated with larger gray matter volume (beta = 0.50, 95% CI 0.11-0.89), hippocampus volume (beta = 0.62, 95% CI 0.15-1.09), and parahippocampal gyrus volume (beta = 0.85, 95% CI 0.34-1.37). The sex-stratification and age-stratification analyses revealed similar findings with the main results, with the pattern of associations significantly presented in the individuals at mid-life and late-life.Long-term stability of BMI level is essential for maintaining brain health. Progressive weight gain is associated with impaired white matter microstructural integrity. Weight and WHR losses are associated with improved general brain health. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the integrated associations between variations in obesity measures and brain health.This study was supported by grants No. 62171297 (Han Lv) and 61931013 (Zhenchang Wang) from the National Natural Science Foundation of China, No. 7242267 from the Beijing Natural Science Foundation (Han Lv), and No. [2015] 160 from the Beijing Scholars Program (Zhenchang Wang).","['Body mass index', 'Brain health', 'Cerebral small vessel disease', 'Cohort study', 'Neuroimaging', 'Variability', 'Waisttohip ratio']"
Intravoxel incoherent motion diffusion-weighted MRI for the evaluation of early spleen involvement in acute leukemia.,"The spleen is a frequent organ of leukemia metastasis. This study aimed to investigate the value of intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for assessing pathologic changes in the spleen and identifying early spleen involvement in patients with acute leukemia (AL).Patients with newly diagnosed AL and healthy controls were recruited between June 2020 and November 2022. All participants underwent abdominal IVIM diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at our hospital. IVIM parameters [pure diffusion coefficient (<i>D</i>); pseudo-diffusion coefficient (<i>D*</i>); and pseudo-perfusion fraction (<i>f</i>)] of the spleen were calculated by the segmented fitting method, and perfusion-diffusion ratio (PDR) was further calculated from the values of <i>D</i>, <i>D*</i> and <i>f</i>. Spleen volumes (SVs) were obtained by manually segmenting the spleen layer by layer. Clinical biomarkers of AL patients were collected. Patients were divided into splenomegaly group and normal SV group according to the individualized reference intervals for SV. IVIM parameters were compared among the control group, AL with normal SV group, and AL with splenomegaly group using one-way analysis of variance, followed by pairwise post hoc comparisons. The correlations of IVIM parameters with clinical biomarkers were analyzed in AL patients. The diagnostic performances of IVIM parameters and their combinations for differentiating among the three groups were compared.Seventy-nine AL patients (AL with splenomegaly: n=54; AL with normal SV: n=25) and 55 healthy controls were evaluated. IVIM parameters were significantly different among the three groups (P<0.001 for <i>D, D*</i> and <i>f</i>; P=0.001 for PDR). <i>D</i> and PDR showed significant differences between the control and AL with normal SV groups in pairwise comparisons (P<0.001, and P=0.031, respectively). <i>D</i> was correlated with white blood cell (WBC) counts (r=-0.424; 95% CI: -0.570, -0.211; P<0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (r=-0.285; 95% CI: -0.486, -0.011; P=0.011), and bone marrow blasts (r=-0.283; 95% CI: -0.476, -0.067; P=0.012). <i>D*</i> (r=-0.276; 95% CI: -0.470, -0.025; P=0.014), <i>f</i> (r=0.514; 95% CI: 0.342, 0.664; P<0.001) and PDR (r=0.343; 95% CI: 0.208, 0.549; P=0.002) were correlated with LDH. The combination of IVIM parameters (AUC: 0.830; 95% CI: 0.729, 0.905) demonstrated better diagnostic efficacy than the single <i>D*</i> (AUC: 0.721; 95% CI: 0.608, 0.816; Delong test: <i>Z=</i>2.012, P=0.044) and <i>f</i> (AUC: 0.647; 95% CI: 0.532, 0.752; Delong test: <i>Z=</i>2.829, P=0.005), but was not significantly different from the single <i>D</i> (AUC: 0.756; 95% CI: 0.647, 0.846; Delong test: <i>Z=</i>1.676, P=0.094) in differentiating the splenomegaly group and normal SV group.IVIM diffusion-weighted MRI could be a potential alternative for assessing pathologic changes in the spleen from cellularity and angiogenesis, and <i>D</i> and PDR may be viable indicators to identify early spleen involvement in patients with AL.","['Acute leukemia AL', 'intravoxel incoherent motion IVIM', 'spleen involvement', 'spleen volume SV', 'splenomegaly']"
Smartphone assessment uncovers real-time relationships between depressed mood and daily functional behaviors after stroke.,"The impact of depressed mood in daily life is difficult to investigate using traditional retrospective assessments, given daily or even within-day mood fluctuations in various contexts. This study aimed to use a smartphone-based ambulatory assessment to examine real-time relationships between depressed mood and functional behaviors among individuals with stroke.A total of 202 participants with mild-to-moderate stroke (90% ischemic, 45% female, 44% Black) completed an ecological momentary assessment five times per day for 2 weeks by reporting their depressed mood and functional behaviors regarding where, with whom, and what activity was spent.Participants spent 28% of their wake-up time participating in passive leisure activities but spent the least time in physical (4%) and vocational (9%) activities. Depressed mood was concurrently lower when participants engaged in social activities (β = -0.023 ± 0.011) and instrumental activities of daily living (β = -0.061 ± 0.013); spent time with family members (β = -0.061 ± 0.014), spouses (β = -0.043, ± 0.016), friends (β = -0.094, ± 0.021), and coworkers (β = -0.050 ± 0.021); and were located in restaurants (β = -0.068 ± 0.029), and homes of family members (β = -0.039 ± 0.020) or friends (β = -0.069 ± 0.031). Greater depressed mood was associated with worse ratings in satisfaction, performance, and engagement of activities in concurrent (βs = -0.036 ± 0.003, -0.053 ± 0.003, -0.044 ± 0.003) and time-lagged models (βs = -0.011 ± 0.004, -0.012 ± 0.004, -0.013 ± 0.004).Smartphone-based ambulatory assessment can elucidate functional behaviors and associated mood after stroke. Findings support behavioral activation treatments to schedule social and instrumental activities for stroke survivors to reduce their depressed mood.","['Telemedicine', 'ambulatory assessment', 'daily functional behaviors', 'depression', 'ecological momentary assessment', 'mobile health', 'smartphone', 'stroke']"
The Impact of Dietary Flavonols on Central Obesity Parameters in Polish Adults.,"Background: Central obesity is defined as the excessive fat tissue located in abdominal region accompanied by systemic inflammation, which drives to cardiovascular disease. Flavonols are antioxidative agents present in food. The aim of this study was investigating the relationship between dietary flavonols intake and central obesity. Methods and results: 80 participants (40 central obese and 40 healthy controls) were administered a food frequency questionnaire dedicated to flavonols intake assessment. Body composition was measured with bioelectrical impedance analysis. The analysis showed significant differences between central obese participants and healthy controls in total flavonol (p = 0.005), quercetin (p = 0.003), kaempferol (p = 0.04) and isorhamnetin (p < 0.001) habitual intake. Among central obese participants, there was a moderate inverse correlation between fat mass (FM) and total flavonol (R = −0.378; 95% CI: −0.620 to −0.071; p = 0.02), quercetin (R = −0.352; 95% CI: −0.601 to −0.041; p = 0.03), kaempferol (R = −0.425; 95% CI: −0.653 to −0.127; p = 0.01) and myricetin intake (R = −0.352; 95% CI: −0.601 to −0.041; p = 0.03). BMI was inversely correlated with total flavonol (R = −0.330; 95% CI: −0.584 to −0.016; p = 0.04) and quercetin intake (R = −0.336; 95% CI: −0.589 to −0.023; p = 0.04). Waist circumference was inversely correlated with total flavonol (R = −0.328; 95% CI: −0.586 to −0.009; p = 0.04), quercetin (R = −0.322; 95% CI: −0.582 to −0.002; p = 0.048) and myricetin intake (R = −0.367; 95% CI: −0.615 to −0.054; p = 0.02). Among flavonols’ dietary sources, there was an inverse correlation between black tea consumption and FM (R: −0.511; 95% CI: −0.712 to −0.233; p < 0.001) and between coffee and waist circumference (R: −0.352; 95% CI: −0.604 to −0.036; p = 0.03) in central obese participants. Conclusions: The higher flavonol intake could play a protective role in abdominal obesity development. What is more, total and selected flavonol dietary intakes are inversely correlated with the parameters used for obesity assessment in central obese participants. The habitual consumption of products rich in flavonols, mainly tea and coffee, could possibly have a preventive role in abdominal obesity development.","['abdominal obesity', 'flavonols', 'isorhamnetin', 'myricetin', 'obesity', 'quercetin']"
Mindfulness meditation and exercise both improve sleep quality: Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial of community dwelling adults.,"To assess the benefits of training in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) or moderate intensity exercise (EX) for improving sleep quality.Randomized controlled trial.Outpatient, community-based.Healthy adults (n = 413) aged 30-69 who did not regularly exercise or practice meditation, and who had no known prior sleep problems.1) 8-weeks of MBSR training; 2) matched EX training; or 3) wait-list control.The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was administered at baseline and at 1, 3, 5, and 7-month follow-up visits.Total PSQI scores and three PSQI factors (perceived sleep quality; daily disturbance, sleep efficiency) were assessed using linear mixed effects regression models for longitudinal data.Compared to controls, PSQI global scores improved significantly for EX (mean change -0.98 points [95% CI -1.56, -0.41] p = 0.001) and marginally for MBSR (-0.53 [-1.10, 0.04] p = 0.07). The perceived sleep quality factor improved for both EX (-0.18 [-0.30, -0.07] p = 0.002) and MBSR (-0.12 [-0.24, -0.01] p = 0.035). The daily disturbance factor improved slightly more for MBSR (-0.13 [-0.22, -0.033] p = 0.008) than EX (-0.09 [-0.19, 0.004] p = 0.06). The sleep efficiency factor did not improve after MBSR (0.08 [-0.045, 0.21] p = 0.2) or EX (-0.07 [-0.20, 0.06] p = 0.3). Improvements in the sleep quality were sustained over 7 months for both groups.Training in MBSR and EX produced small but statistically significant and sustained improvements in sleep quality. For EX participants, this improvement was due primarily to improvements in perceived sleep quality. For MBSR, the decrease in daily disturbance was more important.","['Exercise', 'Meditation', 'Mindfulness', 'PSQI', 'Sleep']"
Factors affecting dental biofilm in patients wearing fixed orthodontic appliances.,"The aim of this study is to investigate the amount and the distribution of biofilm in patients wearing fixed appliances and its relation with age, gender, frequency of tooth brushing, and patient motivation.The sample comprised 52 patients (15.5 ± 3.6 years old, 30 females and 22 males) wearing fixed orthodontic appliances. Dental biofilm was assessed using a modified plaque index (PI). A questionnaire was used to collect patient's information, including gender, age, treatment motivation, and frequency of tooth brushing.Gingival (PI score = 0.9 ± 0.7), mesial (0.8 ± 0.6), and distal (0.8 ± 0.5) areas accumulated more biofilm than occlusal areas (0.3 ± 0.3) (P < 0.038). The maxillary lateral incisors (1.1 ± 0.8) and maxillary canines (1.0 ± 0.8) had more biofilm than other teeth (P < 0.05). The maxillary arch (0.8 ± 0.7) had significantly more biofilm than mandibular arch (0.6 ± 0.6) (P = 0.042). No significant difference was found between the right side (0.7 ± 0.7) and left side (0.7 ± 0.6) (P = 0.627). Less biofilm was found in females (0.6 ± 0.5), adults (0.3 ± 0.3), and ""self-motivated"" patients (0.3 ± 0.3), compared with males (0.9 ± 0.5), children (0.8 ± 0.6), and ""family-motivated"" patients (1.1 ± 0.5) (P < 0.001). The amount of biofilm was associated with self-report of the frequency of daily tooth brushing (P < 0.001).Patients wearing fixed orthodontic appliances have the highest biofilm accumulation on the maxillary lateral incisors and maxillary canines, particularly in the gingival area and areas behind arch wires. Less biofilm was observed in female and adult patients and in those who were self-motivated and brushed their teeth more often.","['Biofilm', 'Dental plaque', 'Oral hygiene', 'Orthodontics', 'White spot lesions']"
Treatment of apathy in Parkinson's disease: A bayesian network meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials.,"Apathy is an important but unrecognised aspect of Parkinson's disease (PD). The optimal therapeutic options for apathy remain unclear. Early recognition and treatment of apathy can reduce the significant burden of disease for patients and their caregivers. Here we conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the comparative efficacy of different treatment modalities of apathy in PD (CRD42021292099).We screened Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases for articles on therapies for apathy in PD. The outcome of interest is the reduction in apathy scores post-intervention and is measured by standardised mean differences (SMD) with 95% credible intervals (CrI). We included only randomised controlled trials examining interventions targeted at reducing apathy.Nineteen studies involving 2372 patients were included in the quantitative analysis. The network meta-analysis found pharmacotherapy to be the most efficacious treatment, significantly better than brain stimulation (SMD -0.43, 95% CrI -0.78 to -0.07), exercise-based interventions (SMD -0.66, 95% CrI -1.25 to -0.08), supplements (SMD -0.33, 95% CrI -0.67 to 0), and placebo (SMD -0.38, 95% CrI -0.56 to -0.23). Subgroup analysis of pharmacotherapy versus placebo found similar efficacy of dopamine agonists (SMD -0.36, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.12, <i>P</i> = 0.003) and alternative medications (SMD -0.42, 95% CI -0.61 to -0.23, <i>P</i> < 0.001). The remaining comparisons and subgroup analyses did not demonstrate any significant treatment effects.Our meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials showed that pharmacotherapy is the most efficacious treatment option, with dopamine agonists having similar efficacy as other medications. Further research is needed to determine the optimal management strategy.","['Interventions', 'Neuropsychiatric symptoms', 'Parkinsons disease', 'apathy']"
Disparities in Pediatric Specialty Referral Scheduling and Completion.,"To estimate differences in scheduled and completed specialty referrals by race, ethnicity, language for care, and insurance type.We studied a retrospective cohort of 38 334 specialty referrals to a large children's hospital between March 2019 and March 2021. We included referrals for patients with primary care clinics within 5 miles of the hospital. We examined whether the odds of and time to scheduled and completed referrals differed by patient sociodemographic characteristics.Of all referrals, 62% were scheduled and 54% were completed. Referral completion rates were lower for patients with Black race (45%), Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander race (48%), Spanish language (49%), and public insurance (47%). Odds of scheduled and completed referral were lower for Asian (aOR scheduled: 0.94, [95% CI: 0.89, 0.99]; aOR completed: 0.92 [0.87, 0.97]), Black (aOR scheduled: 0.86 [0.79, 0.94]; aOR completed: 0.80 [0.73, 0.87]), and publicly insured patients (aOR scheduled: 0.71 [0.66, 0.75]; aOR completed: 0.70 [0.66, 0.75]). Time to scheduled and completed referral was longer for Black (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] scheduled: 0.93 [0.88, 0.98]; aHR completed: 0.93 [0.87, 0.99]) and publicly insured patients (aHR scheduled: 0.85 [0.82, 0.88]; aHR completed: 0.84 [0.80, 0.87]) and families with a language other than English (aHR scheduled: 0.66 [0.62, 0.70]; aHR completed: 0.92 [0.86, 0.99]).Within a geographically homogenous pediatric population, the odds and time to scheduled and completed specialty referrals differed by sociodemographic characteristics, suggesting the effects of discrimination. To improve access equity, health care organizations need clear and consistent referral workflows and more comprehensive metrics for access.","['Access', 'discrimination', 'healthcare disparities', 'language barriers', 'pediatrics', 'racism', 'referral', 'scheduling', 'specialty care']"
The Role of Different Inflammatory Indices in the Diagnosis of COVID-19.,"To assess the role of different inflammatory indices in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection.The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), derived NLR (dNLR), neutrophil to lymphocyte, platelet ratio (NLPR), systemic inflammation index (SII), aggregate index of systemic inflammation (AISI), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) and C-reactive protein-to-lymphocyte ratio (CRP/L) were assessed in 88 COVID-19 patients compared to 41 healthy control subjects.The NLR, PLR, NLPR, SIRI, and CRP/L were significantly increased, while LMR was significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients compared to the control group (P = 0.008, 0.011, <0.001, 0.032, 0.002 and P < 0.001; respectively). The AUC for the assessed indices was LMR (0.738, P = 0.008), NLPR (0.721, P < 0.001), CRP/L (0.692, P = 0.002), NLR (0.649, P < 0.001), PLR (0.643, P = 0.011), SIRI (0.623, P = 0.032), dNLR (0.590, P = 0.111), SII (0.571, P = 0.207), and AISI (0.567, P-0.244). Multivariate analysis showed that NLPR >0.011 (OR: 38.751, P = 0.014), and CRP/L >7.6 (OR: 7.604, P = 0.022) are possible independent diagnostic factors for COVID-19 infection.NLPR and CRP/L could be potential independent diagnostic factors for COVID-19 infection.","['Creactive protein', 'COVID19', 'SII', 'inflammatory index', 'lymphocytes', 'platelets']"
Longitudinal change of intrinsic capacity and associated factors in older Chinese adults: China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study.,"Although intrinsic capacity (IC) has been constructed in older populations, whether IC retains the same structure over time has not been formally examined, nor have the factors associated with the changes in IC over time been thoroughly investigated. This study aimed to establish that the structure of IC remains unchanged over time by testing its longitudinal measurement invariance and to investigate factors that influence the longitudinal change of IC over time.Data came from 7,271 participants aged 60 and older from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study in 2011 (Wave 1) and 2015 (Wave 3). Bifactor confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to construct IC with its domains, and the longitudinal measurement invariance of IC between Waves was tested.Bifactor CFA fitted the data well at both Waves and showed good construct validity. Partial scalar invariance was supported with non-invariant intercepts for delayed word recall, math, and close vision. Decreases in IC were associated with increasing age, being female (-0.030, 95% CI: -0.045, -0.016), living in rural areas (-0.019, 95% CI: -0.030, -0.009), BMI < 18.5 (-0.019, 95% CI: -0.035, -0.003), and hypertension (-0.012, 95% CI: -0.022, -0.001). Increases in IC were associated with higher education (primary school: 0.012, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.024; lower secondary school: 0.023, 95% CI: 0.005, 0.041) and drinking ≥4/week (0.019, 95% CI: 0.003, 0.034). Stratifying the sample by gender, the protective effect of education was observed only in women.The bifactor structure of the IC construct was valid and retained its meaning over time. Longitudinal changes in IC were associated with various sociodemographic factors, lifestyle, and health conditions, confirming the need to monitor IC for timely intervention, particularly in those with risk factors for IC decline.","['Bifactor confirmatory factor analysis', 'Intrinsic capacity', 'Longitudinal measurement invariance', 'Older Chinese adults', 'Risk factors']"
Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients With Different Diseases Measured With the EQ-5D-5L: A Systematic Review.,"<b>Background:</b> The EQ-5D-5L is a generic preference-based questionnaire developed by the EuroQol Group to measure health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in 2005. Since its development, it has been increasingly applied in populations with various diseases and has been found to have good reliability and sensitivity. This study aimed to summarize the health utility elicited from EQ-5D-5L for patients with different diseases in cross-sectional studies worldwide. <b>Methods:</b> Web of Science, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 1, 2012, to October 31, 2019. Cross-sectional studies reporting utility values measured with the EQ-5D-5L in patients with any specific disease were eligible. The language was limited to English. Reference lists of the retrieved studies were manually searched to identify more studies that met the inclusion criteria. Methodological quality was assessed with the Agency for Health Research and Quality (AHRQ) checklist. In addition, meta-analyses were performed for utility values of any specific disease reported in three or more studies. <b>Results:</b> In total, 9,400 records were identified, and 98 studies met the inclusion criteria. In the included studies, 50 different diseases and 98,085 patients were analyzed. Thirty-five studies involving seven different diseases were included in meta-analyses. The health utility ranged from 0.31 to 0.99 for diabetes mellitus [meta-analysis random-effect model (REM): 0.83, (95% CI = 0.77-0.90); fixed-effect model (FEM): 0.93 (95% CI = 0.93-0.93)]; from 0.62 to 0.90 for neoplasms [REM: 0.75 (95% CI = 0.68-0.82); FEM: 0.80 (95% CI = 0.78-0.81)]; from 0.56 to 0.85 for cardiovascular disease [REM: 0.77 (95% CI = 0.75-0.79); FEM: 0.76 (95% CI = 0.75-0.76)]; from 0.31 to 0.78 for multiple sclerosis [REM: 0.56 (95% CI = 0.47-0.66); FEM: 0.67 (95% CI = 0.66-0.68)]; from 0.68 to 0.79 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [REM: 0.75 (95% CI = 0.71-0.80); FEM: 0.76 (95% CI = 0.75-0.77)] from 0.65 to 0.90 for HIV infection [REM: 0.84 (95% CI = 0.80-0.88); FEM: 0.81 (95% CI = 0.80-0.82)]; from 0.37 to 0.89 for chronic kidney disease [REM: 0.70 (95% CI = 0.48-0.92; FEM: 0.76 (95% CI = 0.74-0.78)]. <b>Conclusions:</b> EQ-5D-5L is one of the most widely used preference-based measures of HRQoL in patients with different diseases worldwide. The variation of utility values for the same disease was influenced by the characteristics of patients, the living environment, and the EQ-5D-5L value set. <b>Systematic Review Registration</b>: https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier CRD42020158694.","['EQ5D5L', 'EuroQol', 'HRQOL', 'disease', 'health utility']"
Association of baseline level of cardiovascular risk burden and its temporal changes with cognitive decline.,"Previous studies on cardiovascular risk burden assessed by the Framingham General Cardiovascular Risk Score (FGCRS) and cognitive trajectories mainly focus on Western populations and most of them have used a single measure of cardiovascular risk. In this study, among middle-aged and older Chinese, we investigated (i) the association of baseline FGCRS with subsequent cognitive decline and (ii) the association of FGCRS change with concomitant cognitive decline.In wave 1 to wave 4 (2011-2018) of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study, global cognition was assessed by orientation, memory, and executive function. FGCRS was assessed and categorized into tertiles (low, intermediate, and high) at baseline (2011) and 4 years after (2015). Furthermore, external validation was performed to check its generalizability using the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) 2008-2018.In total, 6,402 participants with a mean [standard deviation (SD) age of 57.8 (8.4) years, 49.0% women] with complete baseline data and at least one reassessment of cognitive function were included. A 10% increment in baseline FGCRS was associated with a faster decline in global cognition (-0.010 SD/year, 95% CI -0.013, -0.008). Among 4,336 participants [mean (SD) age of 57.8 (8.2) years, 50.0% women] with data on FGCRS changes, compared to individuals with the consistently low FGCRS (reference group), a faster global cognition decline rate was observed in the low to intermediate group (-0.026 SD/year, 95% CI -0.045, -0.007), the low to high group (-0.052 SD/year, 95% CI -0.102, -0.001), the consistently intermediate group (-0.019 SD/year, 95% CI -0.033, -0.005), the intermediate to high group (-0.040 SD/year, 95% CI -0.058, -0.022), the high to intermediate group (-0.024 SD/year, 95% CI -0.047, -0.002), and the consistently high group (-0.047 SD/year, 95% CI -0.060, -0.034). Similar trends were observed for individual cognitive domains. Results from the external validation using the ELSA remained consistent.Higher baseline FGCRS was associated with faster cognitive decline. However, there was no consistent relationship between the direction of changes in FGCRS and cognitive decline.","['Framingham General Cardiovascular Risk Score', 'change', 'cognitive decline', 'cohort', 'older people']"
Association between weekly fruit and vegetable consumption and depressive symptoms: results from the Korean Elderly Environmental Panel study.,"Although previous studies have investigated the correlation between fruit and vegetable consumption and depression, the results remain inconclusive. The present study aimed to investigate the association between weekly fruit and vegetable consumption and depressive symptoms in elderly Koreans.A multiple covariate linear regression analysis was performed using the data of 1,226 elderly individuals ≥ 60 years of age who participated in the Korean Elderly Environmental Panel II study from 2012 to 2014. Depressive symptoms were evaluated using the Korean version of the Short form Geriatric Depression Scale (SGDS-K). Generalized linear mixed-effects models were constructed to analyze the repeated measurements of 305 people who participated in the survey every year.After adjusting for confounders, SGDS-K scores were negatively associated with the frequency of weekly fruit consumption as follows (β [95% confidence interval; CI]: -0.17 [-0.28 to -0.05], -0.17 [-0.27 to -0.07], -0.42 [-0.54 to 0.29], and -0.33 [-0.44 to -0.21]) for less than 1 time/wk, 1-3 times/wk, 4-6 times/wk, and daily, respectively, compared to no consumption. The SGDS-K scores were also negatively associated with the frequency of vegetable consumption (β [95% CI]: -0.86 [-1.18 to -0.55], -0.18 [-0.35 to -0.01], -0.36 [-0.53 to -0.18], and -0.15 [-0.29 to 0.00]) in the above order, respectively.Fruit consumption was inversely associated with depression levels in a dose-dependent manner. Although there was no dose-response relationship between vegetable consumption and the level of depression, it was negatively associated with SGDS-K scores.","['Aged', 'Depression', 'Fruit', 'Korean', 'Korean version of Short form Geriatric Depression Scale', 'Vegetables']"
"Household, dietary and healthcare factors predicting childhood stunting in Ethiopia.","Stunting, decidedly prevalent in Ethiopia, is a reduction of linear growth associated with a series of adverse consequences. However, little is known about its determinants and factors associated in Ethiopia and elsewhere. Therefore, this study aimed to determine major undelying factors associated with risk of stunting among under-five children in Ethiopia. We used the 2016 Ethiopian Demographic and Heath Survey (EDHS) data and analysed a total of 11,023 children aged 0-59 months' data. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression were fitted to identify key predictors and factors associated with stunting. Results show that, household and demographic factors such as maternal education (AOR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.89), wealth index (AOR: 0.65 (0.54, 0.78), sex of child (AOR: 0.78 (0.72, 0.85), possession of refrigerator (AOR: 0.57 (0.36, 0.89), possession of television and others like twin birth, house main floor material, types of cooking fuel were significantly association with stunting. Among dietary factors, early initiation of breast feeding; feeding powdered or fresh milk (AOR: 0.63 (0.52, 0.76); formula feeding (AOR: 0.41 (0.21, 0.81); consumption of organ meat(s) (AOR: 0.52 (0.32, 0.85) and beta-carotene rich fruits and vegetables were significantly associated lower odds of stunting. Antenatal care (ANC) follow-up, deworming during pregnancy (AOR : 0.11 (0.02, 0.74), institutional delivery (AOR : 0.64 (0.58, 0.71) and birth size (AOR: 5.1 (1.64, 15.88) were among the health care factors associated with stunting of under-five children. In conclusion, stunting is modulated by several household, dietary and healthcare factors, both at household and community-level. Likewise; improving household income, women empowerment, dietary diversity among mothers and children and improving maternal health care system are critical to mitigate under-five stunting more rapidly.","['Children', 'Ethiopia', 'Predicting variables', 'Stunting', 'Undernutrition']"
Improving the optimized shea butter quality: a great potential of utilization for common consumers and industrials.,"Industrials interest in fats as raw material, resides in their exceptional quality and potentialities of exploitation in several fields. This study aimed to exalt the optimized shea butter quality and present its wide potentialities of utilization. Hence, the characteristics of beige and yellow optimized shea butters were determined. Both samples recorded very weak acid (0.280 ± 0.001 and 0.140 ± 0.001 mgKOH/g) and peroxide (0.960 ± 0.001 and 1.010 ± 0.001 mEgO2/kg) indexes, when the iodine indexes (52.64 ± 0.20 and 53.06 ± 0.20 gI2/100 g) and the unsaponifiable matters (17.61 ± 0.01 and 17.27 ± 0.01 %) were considerable. The refractive indexes (1.454 ± 0.00 and 1.453 ± 0.00) and the pH (6.50 ± 0.30 and 6.78 ± 0.30) were statistically similar; but the specific gravity (0.915 ± 0.01-0.79 ± 0.01 and 0.94 ± 0.01-0.83 ± 0.01) and the viscosity (90.41 ± 0.20-20.02 ± 0.20 and 125.37 ± 0.20-23.55 ± 0.20 MPas) differed and decreased exponentially with the temperature increasing (35-65 °C), except for the specific gravity of the yellow butter which decreased linearly. The UV-Vis spectrum showed a high peak at 300 nm and a rapid decrease from 300 to 500 nm when the near infra-red one, revealed peaks at 450, 1200, 1400, 1725 and 2150 nm for all the samples. The chromatographic profile identified palmitic (16.42 and 26.36 %), stearic (32.39 and 36.36 %), oleic (38.12 and 29.09 %), linoleic (9.72 and 5.92 %) and arachidic (1.84 and 1.59 %) acids, and also exaltolide compound (1.51 and 0.68 %). The samples also contained essential minerals (Calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron, etc.) carotene (550 ± 50 and 544 ± 50 ppm), vitamins A (0.065 ± 0.001 and 0.032 ± 0.001 µg/g) and E (2992.09 ± 1.90 and 3788.44 ± 1.90 ppm) in relatively important amounts; neither microbiological germs nor heavy were detected. All these valorizing characteristics would confer to the optimized shea butters good aptitude for exportation and exploitation in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.","['Industrial', 'Optimized', 'Physicochemical and nutritive characteristics', 'Potentiality of exploitation', 'Shea butters']"
Changes in axial length in anisometropic children wearing orthokeratology lenses.,"There is a particular anisometropia occurring in one eye with myopia, while the other eye has very low myopia, emmetropia, or very low hyperopia. It is unclear how the binocular axial length changes when these children wear unilateral OK lenses only in the more myopic eyes. This study investigates the changes in the axial elongation of both eyes.This is a 1-year retrospective study. In total, 148 children with myopic anisometropia were included. The more myopic eyes were wearing orthokeratology lenses (treated eyes), whereas the contralateral eyes were not indicated for visual correction (untreated eyes). The untreated eyes were classified into three subgroups based on the spherical equivalent refraction (SER): low myopia (≤ -0.50 D, <i>n</i> = 37), emmetropia (+0.49 to -0.49 D, <i>n</i> = 76), and low hyperopia (≥0.50 D, <i>n</i> = 35). Changes in the axial length (AL) were compared between the untreated and treated eyes and among the three subgroups.The axial elongation was 0.14 ± 0.18 mm and 0.39 ± 0.27 mm in all treated and untreated eyes, respectively (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The interocular AL difference decreased significantly from 1.09 ± 0.45 mm at the baseline to 0.84 ± 0.52 mm at 1 year (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The baseline median (Q1, Q3) SER of the untreated eyes were -0.75 D (-0.56, -0.88 D), 0.00 D (0.00, -0.25 D), and +0.75 D (+1.00, +0.62 D) in low myopia, emmetropia, and low hyperopia subgroups, respectively. The axial elongation was 0.14 ± 0.18 mm, 0.15 ± 0.17 mm, and 0.13 ± 0.21 mm (<i>p</i> = 0.92) in the treated eyes and 0.44 ± 0.25 mm, 0.35 ± 0.24 mm, and 0.41 ± 0.33 mm in the untreated eyes (<i>p</i> = 0.11) after 1 year. Multivariate linear regression analyses only showed significant differences in axial elongation between the emmetropia and low myopia subgroups of untreated eyes (<i>p</i> = 0.04; <i>p</i> > 0.05 between other subgroups).Unilateral orthokeratology lenses effectively reduced axial elongation in the more myopic eyes and reduced interocular AL differences in children with myopic anisometropia. The refractive state of the untreated eyes did not affect the axial elongation of the more myopic eye wearing the orthokeratology lens. In the untreated eyes, AL increased faster in the low myopia subgroup than in the emmetropia subgroup.","['anisometropia', 'axial length', 'myopia', 'refractive state', 'unilateral orthokeratology lens']"
"Intermittent Resistance Training at Moderate Altitude: Effects on the Force-Velocity Relationship, Isometric Strength and Muscle Architecture.","Intermittent hypoxic resistance training (IHRT) may help to maximize the adaptations following resistance training, although conflicting evidence is available. The aim of this study was to explore the influence of moderate altitude on the functional, neural and muscle architecture responses of the quadriceps muscles following a power-oriented IHRT intervention. Twenty-four active males completed two 4-week consecutive training blocks comprising general strengthening exercises (weeks 1-4) and power-oriented resistance training (weeks 5-8). Training sessions were conducted twice a week at moderate altitude (2320 m; IHRT, <i>n</i> = 13) or normoxia (690 m; NT, <i>n</i> = 11). Training intensity during the second training block was set to the individual load corresponding to a barbell mean propulsive velocity of 1 m·s<sup>-1</sup>. Pre-post assessments, performed under normoxic conditions, comprised quadriceps muscle architecture (thickness, pennation angle and fascicle length), isometric maximal (MVF) and explosive strength, and voluntary muscle activation. Dynamic strength performance was assessed through the force-velocity relationship (F<sub>0</sub>, V<sub>0</sub>, P<sub>0</sub>) and a repeated CMJ test (CMJ<sub>15MP</sub>). Region-specific muscle thickness changes were observed in both training groups (<i>p</i> < 0.001, <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><msubsup><mrow><mi>η</mi></mrow><mrow><mtext>G</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msubsup></math> = 0.02). A small opposite trend in pennation angle changes was observed (ES [90% CI]: -0.33 [-0.65, -0.01] <i>vs</i>. 0.11 [-0.44, 0.6], in the IHRT and NT group, respectively; <i>p</i> = 0.094, <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><msubsup><mrow><mi>η</mi></mrow><mrow><mtext>G</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msubsup></math> = 0.02). Both training groups showed similar improvements in MVF (ES: 0.38 [0.20, 0.56] <i>vs</i>. 0.55 [0.29, 0.80], in the IHRT and NT group, respectively; <i>p</i> = 0.645, <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><msubsup><mrow><mi>η</mi></mrow><mrow><mtext>G</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msubsup></math> < 0.01), <i>F</i><sub>0</sub> (ES: 0.41 [-0.03, 0.85] <i>vs</i>. 0.52 [0.04, 0.99], in the IHRT and NT group, respectively; <i>p</i> = 0.569, <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><msubsup><mrow><mi>η</mi></mrow><mrow><mtext>G</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msubsup></math> < 0.01) and <i>P</i><sub>0</sub> (ES: 0.53 [0.07, 0.98] vs. 0.19 [-0.06, 0.44], in the IHRT and NT group, respectively; <i>p</i> = 0.320, <math xmlns=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML""><msubsup><mrow><mi>η</mi></mrow><mrow><mtext>G</mtext></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn></mrow></msubsup></math> < 0.01). No meaningful changes in explosive strength performance were observed. In conclusion, contrary to earlier adverse associations between altitude and resistance-training muscle adaptations, similar anatomical and functional muscle strength responses can be achieved in both environmental conditions. The observed region-specific muscle thickness changes may encourage further research on the potential influence of IHRT on muscle morphological changes.","['hypoxia', 'muscle', 'muscle architecture', 'power training', 'strength training']"
"Phosphoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic, alpha polypeptide RNA interference inhibits growth of colon cancer cell SW948.","To investigate the gene knock-down effect by the phosphoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic, alpha polypeptide (PIK3CA)-targeted double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and its effect on cell proliferation and cycle distribution in SW948.Two PIK3CA-targeted dsRNAs were constructed and transfected into SW948 cells. Transfections were performed using lipofectamine™ 2000. The transfection effectiveness was calculated basing on the rate of fluorescence cell of SW948 at 6 h after transfection. Total messenger RNA was extracted from these cells using the RNeasy kit, and semiquantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect the down-regulation of PIK3CA, AKT1, MYC, and CCND1 gene expression. Cells were harvested, proteins were resolved, and western blot was employed to detect the expression levels of PIK3CA, AKT1, MYC, and CCND1 gene. Cell proliferation was assessed by 3-(4,5)-dimethylthiahiazo (-z-y1)-3,5-di-phenytetrazoliumromide assay and the inhibition rate was calculated. Soft agar colony formation assay was performed basing on colonies greater than 60 μm in diameter at ×100 magnification. The effect on cell cycle distribution and apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry. All experiments were performed in triplicate.Green fluorescence was observed in SW948 cell transfected with plasmid Pgenesil-1, and the transfection effectiveness was about 65%. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, mRNA expression of PIK3CA in SW948 cells was 0.51 ± 0.04 vs 0.49 ± 0.03 vs 0.92 ± 0.01 vs 0.93 ± 0.03 (P = 0.001 ) in Pgenesil-CA1, Pgenesil-CA2, negative and blank group respectively. mRNA expression of AKT1 was 0.50 ± 0.03 vs 0.48 ± 0.01 vs 0.93 ± 0.04 vs 0.92 ± 0.02 (P = 0.000) in Pgenesil-CA1, Pgenesil-CA2, negative and blank group respectively. mRNA expression of MYC was 0.49 ± 0.01 vs 0.50 ± 0.04 vs 0.90 ± 0.02 vs 0.91 ± 0.03 (P = 0.001) in the four groups respectively. mRNA expression of CCND1 was 0.45 ± 0.02 vs 0.51 ± 0.01 vs 0.96 ± 0.03 vs 0.98 ± 0.01 (P = 0.001) in the four groups respectively. The protein level of PIK3CA was 0.53 ± 0.01 vs 0.54 ± 0.02 vs 0.92 ± 0.03 vs 0.91 ± 0.02 (P = 0.001) in Pgenesil-CA1, Pgenesil-CA2, negative and blank group respectively. The protein level of AKT1 in the four groups was 0.49 ± 0.02 vs 0.55 ± 0.03 vs 0.94 ± 0.03 vs 0.95 ± 0.04, P = 0.000). The protein level of MYC in the four groups was 0.51 ± 0.03 vs 0.52 ± 0.04 vs 0.92 ± 0.02 vs 0.95 ± 0.01 (P = 0.000). The protein level of CCND1 in the four groups was 0.54 ± 0.04 vs 0.56 ± 0.03 vs 0.93 ± 0.01 vs 0.93 ± 0.03 (P = 0.000). Both Pgenesil-CA1 and Pgenesil-CA2 plasmids significantly suppressed the growth of SW948 cells when compared with the negative or blank group at 48 h after transfection (29% vs 25% vs 17% vs 14%, P = 0.001), 60 h after transfection (38% vs 34% vs 19% vs 16%, P = 0.001), and 72 h after transfection (53% vs 48% vs 20% vs 17%, P = 0.000). Numbers of colonies in negative, blank, CA1, and CA2 groups were 42 ± 4, 45 ± 5, 8 ± 2, and 10 ± 3, respectively (P = 0.000). There were more than 4.5 times colonies in the blank and negative control groups as there were in the CA1 and CA2 groups. In addition, the colonies in blank and negative control groups were also larger than those in the CA1 and CA2 groups. The percentage of cells in the CA1 and CA2 groups was significantly higher in G₀/G₁ phase, but lower in S and G₂/M phase when compared with the negative and control groups. Moreover, cell apoptosis rates in the CA1 and CA2 groups were 5.11 ± 0.32 and 4.73 ± 0.32, which were significantly higher than those in negative (0.95 ± 0.11, P = 0.000) and blank groups (0.86 ± 0.13, P = 0.001). No significant difference was found between CA1 and CA2 groups in cell cycle distribution and apoptosis.PIK3CA-targeted short hairpin RNAs can block the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt signaling pathway and inhibit cell growth, increase apoptosis, and induce cell cycle arrest in the PIK3CA-mutant colon cancer SW948 cells.","['Colon cancer', 'Phosphoinositide3kinase pathway', 'Phosphoinositide3kinase', 'catalytic', 'alpha polypeptide', 'RNA interference']"
The promising role of probiotics/prebiotics/synbiotics in energy metabolism biomarkers in patients with NAFLD: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a chronic liver disease with a high prevalence worldwide, seriously harming human health, and its pathogenesis remains unclear. In recent years, increasing evidence has indicated that intestinal microbiota plays an important role in the occurrence and development of NAFLD. The regulation method of probiotics/prebiotics/synbiotics can alter the intestinal microbiota and has been suggested as an option in the treatment of NAFLD.Five databases of PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, clinicaltrails.gov, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure were searched initially, and then the eligible studies were screened. Finally, the data of included studieswere extracted, combined and analyzed.A total of 29 randomized controlled trials involving 2,110 patients were included in this study. The results showed that using probiotics/prebiotics/synbiotics in the intervention group could reduce the levels of glucose (SMD = -0.23, 95% CI [-0.45, -0.01], <i>P</i> = 0.04), HOMA-IR (SMD = -0.47, 95% CI [-0.63, -0.31], <i>P</i> < 0.00001) and insulin (SMD = -0.46, 95% CI [-0.76, -0.16], <i>P</i> = 0.002) in sugar metabolism; in terms of lipid metabolism, the levels of TC (SMD = -0.62, 95%CI [-0.87, -0.36], <i>P</i> < 0.00001), and LDL-C (SMD = -0.57, 95%CI [-0.85, -0.28], <i>P</i> < 0.00001) were decreased; and the level of ALB was decreased in protein metabolism (SMD = -0.34, 95%CI [-0.61, -0.06], <i>P</i> = 0.02).Based on the current evidence, probiotics/prebiotics/synbiotics may improve energy metabolism biomarkers in the NAFLD population, but these effects still need to be confirmed by further research.https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/#aboutpage.","['NAFLD', 'energy metabolism biomarkers', 'microbiota modulation', 'prebiotics', 'probiotics', 'synbiotics']"
General population normative data for the EQ-5D-3L in the five largest European economies.,"The EQ-5D is a generic measure of health that is widely applied for health economic and non-economic purposes. Population norms can be used to facilitate the interpretation of EQ-5D data. The objective of this study was to develop a set of pooled normative EQ-5D-3L values for the five largest European economies (EUR5).EQ-5D-3L index values based on the time trade-off (TTO) were available for all EUR5 countries (n = 21,425): France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom (UK). Country-specific data sets were aggregated and weighted to facilitate the derivation of norms for gender and age groups. Analyses included equal weighting and weighting by population and economy size. Norms were also calculated using the European visual analog scale-based value set (European VAS), the EQ VAS and separately by dimension.Pooled mean (SD) population weighted TTO values for males/females were 0.967 (0.122)/0.959 (0.118) for ages 18-24; 0.965 (0.096)/0.954 (0.117) for ages 25-34; 0.943 (0.165)/0.936 (0.169) for ages 35-44; 0.934 (0.150)/0.921 (0.157) for ages 45-54; 0.896 (0.188)/0.875 (0.197) for ages 55-64; 0.900 (0.158)/0.839 (0.218) for ages 65-74; and 0.830 (0.234)/0.756 (0.291) for ages 75 and older. Mean values decreased and variance increased with age; females had slightly lower mean values than males across all age bands. The unequal weighting approaches produced similar point estimates with smaller variances. Mean values for the European VAS were slightly lower than those for the TTO-based index.Normative EQ-5D-3L values can be used to benchmark the outcomes of treated patients against the health of the general population. EUR5 norms may be useful in research applications inferring to Europe or the European Union as a whole, particularly when sample size precludes analysis at the country level.","['Costeffectiveness models', 'EQ5D', 'EUR5', 'Health', 'Population norms']"
Changes in genetic parameters for fitness and growth traits in pigs under genomic selection.,"Genomic selection increases accuracy and decreases generation interval, speeding up genetic changes in the populations. However, intensive changes caused by selection can reduce the genetic variation and can strengthen undesirable genetic correlations. The purpose of this study was to investigate changes in genetic parameters for fitness traits related with prolificacy (FT1) and litter survival (FT2 and FT3), and for growth (GT1 and GT2) traits in pigs over time. The data set contained 21,269 (FT1), 23,246 (FT2), 23,246 (FT3), 150,492 (GT1), and 150,493 (GT2) phenotypic records obtained from 2009 to 2018. The pedigree file included 369,776 animals born between 2001 and 2018, of which 39,103 were genotyped. Genetic parameters were estimated with bivariate models (FT1-GT1, FT1-GT2, FT2-GT1, FT2-GT2, FT3-GT1, and FT3-GT2) using 3-yr sliding subsets. With a Bayesian implementation using the GIBBS3F90 program computations were performed as genomic analysis (GEN) or pedigree-based analysis (PED), that is, with or without genotypes, respectively. For GEN (PED), the changes in heritability from the first to the last year interval, that is, from 2009-2011 to 2015-2018 were 8.6 to 5.6 (7.9 to 8.8) for FT1, 7.8 to 7.2 (7.7 to 10.8) for FT2, 11.4 to 7.6 (10.1 to 7.5) for FT3, 35.1 to 16.5 (32.5 to 23.7) for GT1, and 35.9 to 16.5 (32.6 to 24.1) for GT2. Differences were also observed for genetic correlations as they changed from -0.31 to -0.58 (-0.28 to -0.73) for FT1-GT1, -0.32 to -0.50 (-0.29 to -0.74) for FT1-GT2, -0.27 to -0.45 (-0.30 to -0.65) for FT2-GT1, -0.28 to -0.45 (-0.32 to -0.66) for FT2-GT2, 0.14 to 0.17 (0.11 to 0.04) for FT3-GT1, and 0.14 to 0.18 (0.11 to 0.05) for FT3-GT2. Strong selection in pigs reduced heritabilities and emphasized the antagonistic genetic relationships between fitness and growth traits. With genotypes considered, heritability estimates were smaller and genetic correlations were greater than estimates with only pedigree and phenotypes. When selection is based on genomic information, genetic parameters estimated without this information can be biased because preselection is not accounted for by the model.","['Bulmer effect', 'genetic correlation', 'genomic information', 'heritability', 'ssGREML']"
Early-Life Exposure to the Chinese Famine and Risk of Cognitive Decline.,"Previous studies on the Chinese famine suggested long-term effects of early-life famine exposure on health conditions. This study aims to investigate the association between exposure to the Chinese famine of 1959-1961 at different early-life stages and the risk of cognitive decline in adulthood. A total of 6417 adults born between 1952 and 1964 in the 2015 survey data of China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study were included in this study. Cognitive performance was estimated through a series of comprehensive neuropsychological tests, including the Telephone Interview of Cognitive Status (TICS-10), word recall, and pentagon drawing. Multiple generalized linear model (GLM) was employed to detect the association between multi-stage early-life famine exposure and late-life cognitive performance. Compared with the unexposed group, respondents exposed to famine in the fetal period performed worse in the TICS (difference -0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.93 to -0.10), word recall (difference -0.46, 95% CI: -0.74 to -0.19), and general cognition (difference -1.05, 95% CI: -1.64 to -0.47). Furthermore, we also found negative effects of famine exposure on performance of word recall and pentagon drawing in the early (word recall difference -0.56, 95% CI: -1.00 to -0.11; pentagon drawing difference -0.76, 95% CI: -1.40 to -0.12), mid (word recall difference -0.46, 95% CI: -0.81 to -0.11; pentagon drawing difference -0.66, 95% CI: -1.16 to -0.16), and late (word recall difference -0.30, 95% CI: -0.55 to -0.04; pentagon drawing difference -0.75, 95% CI: -1.13 to -0.37) childhood-exposed groups. Early-life famine exposure in different stages is positively associated with late-life cognitive decline. Fetal famine exposure might affect the overall cognitive status in adulthood, and childhood famine exposure has potential adverse effects on visuospatial episodic memory.","['China', 'childhood', 'cognitive decline', 'famine', 'fetal']"
Small-incision lenticule extraction versus femtosecond lenticule extraction for myopic: a systematic review and Meta-analysis.,"To examine differences in efficacy, accuracy, safety, aberrations and corneal biomechanical between Small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and femtosecond lenticule extraction (FLEx) for myopia.Comprehensive studies were conducted on the PubMed, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane Controlled Trials Register before 31 July, 2015. Meta-analyses were performed on the primary outcomes [loss of ≥2 lines of corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) ≥20/20, spherical equivalent (SE) within ±0.50 diopters (D), final refractive SE], secondary outcomes were high-order aberrations (HOAs) and corneal biomechanical [central corneal thickness (CCT), corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF)].Seven trials describing a total of 320 eyes with myopia were included in this Meta-analysis. No significant differences were found in the efficacy [UDVA weighted mean difference (WMD) -0.01; 95%CI: -0.04 to 0.01; <i>P</i>=0.37, UDVA ≥20/20, OR 1.49; 95%CI: 0.78 to 2.86; <i>P</i>=0.23], accuracy (SE WMD -0.03; 95%CI: -0.12 to 0.07; <i>P</i>=0.58, SE within ±0.5 D OR 1.25; 95%CI: 0.34 to 4.65; <i>P</i>=0.74), HOAs (WMD -0.04; 95%CI: -0.09 to 0.01; <i>P</i>=0.14) and CCT WMD 1.83; 95%CI: -7.07 to 10.72; <i>P</i>=0.69, CH WMD -0.01; 95%CI: -0.42 to 0.40; <i>P</i>=0.97, CRF WMD 0.17; 95%CI: -0.33 to 0.67; <i>P</i>=0.50) in the last fellow-up. But for safety, FLEx may achieve fewer CDVA lost two or more two lines (OR 11.11; 95%CI: 1.27 to 96.86; <i>P</i>=0.03) than SMILE, however CDVA (WMD 0.00; 95%CI: -0.03 to 0.02; <i>P</i>=0.77) is similar.SMILE and FLEx are comparable in terms of both efficacy, accuracy, aberrations and corneal biomechanical measures in the follow-up, but FLEx seems to be better in safety measures. The results should be interpreted cautiously since relevant evidence is still limited, although it is accumulating. Further large-scale, well-designed randomized controlled trials are urgently needed.","['Metaanalysis', 'femtosecond lenticule extraction', 'myopia', 'smallincision lenticule extraction']"
Validity and Reliability of the Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament Test and the Thumb Localizing Test in Patients With Stroke.,"<b>Background:</b> Somatosensory impairment is common in patients who have had a stroke and can affect their motor function and activities of daily living (ADL). Therefore, detecting and treating somatosensory impairments properly is considered to be very important, and various examinations have been developed. However, the reliability and validity of few of them have been verified due to differences in the procedure of each examiner or poor quantification by the examination itself. <b>Objective:</b> We hypothesized that, with fixed procedures two convenient clinical examinations, the Semmes-Weinstein Monofilament Test (SWMT) and the Thumb Localizing Test (TLT), could provide reliable assessments of light touch sensation and proprioception. The purpose of this study was to verify the reliability and validity of these two examinations as indices of somatosensory impairment of the upper extremity (UE) in patients with chronic post-stroke hemiparesis. <b>Methods:</b> Fifty patients with chronic stroke (median time after onset of stroke, 848 [474-1708] days, mean age 57 [standard deviation 14] years) were enrolled at Keio University Hospital from 2017 to 2018. Examiners learned the original method of the SWMT and the TLT rigorously and shared it with each other. The TLT procedure was partially modified by dividing the location of the patient's thumb into four spaces. Two examiners evaluated the SWMT and the TLT for 2 days, and intra-rater and inter-rater reliabilities were calculated using weighted kappa statistics. In addition to this, the evaluator size score of the SWMT was assessed with Bland-Altman analysis to evaluate systematic bias. The Stroke Impairment Assessment Set (SIAS) sensory items were used to assess validity, and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were calculated. <b>Results:</b> Intra/inter-rater agreements of the SWMT grade score were 0.89 (thumb, 95%CI: 0.83-0.95)/ 0.75 (0.60-0.91) and 0.80 (index finger, 0.67-0.93)/0.79 (0.66-0.92), and of the TLT they were 0.83 (navel level proximal space, 0.71-0.95)/ 0.83 (0.73-0.92), 0.90 (navel level distal space, 0.85-0.96)/ 0.80 (0.69-0.90), 0.80 (shoulder level proximal space, 0.68-0.92)/ 0.77 (0.65-0.89), and 0.87 (shoulder level distal space, 0.80-0.93)/ 0.80 (0.68-0.92) (<i>P</i> < 0.001, each item). All of them showed substantial agreement, but the MDC of the SWMT evaluator size was 1.28 to 1.79 in the inter-rater test and 1.94-2.06 in the intra-rater test. The SWMT grade score showed a strong correlation with the SIAS light touch sensation item (<i>r</i> = 0.65, <i>p</i> < 0.001), as did the TLT with the SIAS position sense item (<i>r</i> = -0.70-0.62, <i>p</i> < 0.001 each space). <b>Conclusions:</b> The reliability and validity of the SWMT and the TLT were verified. These tests can be used as reliable sensory examinations of the UE in patients with chronic stroke, and especially for the SWMT, it is more reliable for screening.","['SemmesWeinstein monofilament test', 'assessment', 'rehabilitation', 'somatosensory disorders', 'stroke', 'thumb localizing test']"
Effectiveness of psychological interventions delivered by physiotherapists in the management of neck pain: a systematic review with meta-analysis.,"Physiotherapists are increasingly using psychological treatments for musculoskeletal conditions. We assessed the effects of physiotherapist-delivered psychological interventions on pain, disability, and quality of life in neck pain. We evaluated quality of intervention reporting. We searched databases for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comprising individuals with acute or chronic whiplash-associated disorder (WAD) or nontraumatic neck pain (NTNP), comparing physiotherapist-delivered psychological interventions to standard care or no treatment. Data were extracted regarding study characteristics and outcomes. Standardised mean difference (SMD) was calculated by random-effects meta-analysis. We evaluated certainty of evidence using Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) and intervention reporting using TIDieR. Fourteen RCTs (18 articles-4 detail additional outcome/follow-up data) were included comprising 2028 patients, examining acute WAD (n = 4), subacute/mixed NTNP (n = 3), chronic WAD (n = 2), and chronic NTNP (n = 5). Treatment effects on pain favoured psychological interventions in chronic NTNP at short-term (SMD -0.40 [95% CI -0.73, -0.07]), medium-term (SMD -0.29 [95% CI -0.57, 0.00]), and long-term (SMD -0.32 [95% CI -0.60, -0.05]) follow-up. For disability, effects favoured psychological interventions in acute WAD at short-term follow-up (SMD -0.39 [95% CI -0.72, -0.07]) and chronic NTNP at short-term (SMD -0.53 [95% CI -0.91, -0.15]), medium-term (SMD -0.49 [95% CI -0.77, -0.21]), and long-term (SMD -0.60 [95% CI -0.94, -0.26]) follow-up. GRADE ratings were typically moderate, and intervention reporting often lacked provision of trial materials and procedural descriptions. Psychological interventions delivered by physiotherapists were more effective than standard physiotherapy for chronic NTNP (small-to-medium effects) and, in the short term, acute WAD.","['Chronic pain', 'Neck pain', 'Physical therapy modalities', 'Psychosocial intervention', 'Rehabilitation', 'Whiplash injuries']"
Post-processing reproducibility of the structural characteristics of the common carotid artery in a Flemish population.,"Common carotid artery (CCA) intima-media thickness (IMT), lumen diameter, and maximum plaque thickness were assessed on ultrasound images. The objective of the study was to evaluate the intra- and inter-reader reproducibility of the measurements following a standardised protocol.Two readers performed the off-line measurements on B-mode ultrasound images of the distal CCA, in a randomly selected subset (n = 60) from a Flemish population cohort (FLEMENGHO). We calculated the coefficient of variation, the interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and reproducibility according to the Bland-Altman method.The intra-reader bias for the measurements of left and right side CCA IMT were -0.003 ± 0.04 mm (p = 0.55) and 0.01 ± 0.04 mm (p = 0.03), respectively. The intra-reader bias of the lumen diameter was -0.04 ± 0.25 mm (p = 0.27) for the left and 0.02 ± 0.22 mm (p = 0.45) for the right side. The measurements for the maximum plaque thickness showed no intra-reader differences with bias 0.07 ± 0.2 mm (p = 0.26) for the left and -0.03 ± 0.2 mm (p = 0.55) for the right side. The inter-reader analysis showed good reproducibility for the left and right side CCA IMT with bias 0.004 ± 0.06 mm (p = 0.57) and -0.008 ± 0.05 mm (p = 0.19), respectively, but the lumen diameter measurements showed inter-reader differences, with bias 0.17 ± 0.27 mm (p < 0.0001) for the left and 0.10 ± 0.21 mm (p = 0.0006) for the right side. The inter-reader bias for the maximum plaque thickness were 0.07 ± 0.2 mm (p = 0.21) and -0.1 ± 0.4 mm (p = 0.26) for the left and right side, respectively.The results demonstrated a reliable reproducibility of carotid wall structural measurements, allowing for an adequate further analysis of the entire population cohort.","['Carotid artery', 'Carotid plaques', 'Intimamedia thickness', 'Reproducibility study']"
Ultrasonographic study of fetal facial profile markers during the first trimester.,"To establish reference ranges of fetal facial profile markers and study their correlations with crown-rump length (CRL) during the first trimester (11 ~ 13<sup>+ 6</sup> weeks' gestation) in a Chinese population.Ultrasonographic images of measuring fetal nuchal translucency (NT) were retrospectively selected randomly in normal fetuses whose parents were both Chinese. The facial markers included inferior facial angle (IFA), maxilla-nasion-mandible (MNM) angle, facial maxillary angle (FMA) and profile line (PL) distance. These markers were measured through ViewPoint 6 software by two experienced sonographers.Three hundred and eighty fetuses were selected. The ICCs (95 % CI) of intra-operator 1 reproducibility of IFA, MNM angle, FMA, PL distance were 0.944 (0.886 ~ 0.973), 0.804 (0.629 ~ 0.902), 0.834 (0.68 ~ 0.918) and 0.935 (0.868 ~ 0.969), respectively. The ICCs (95 % CI) of intra-operator 2 reproducibility of IFA, MNM angle, FMA, PL distance were 0.931 (0.857 ~ 0.967), 0.809 (0.637 ~ 0.904), 0.786 (0.600 ~ 0.892) and 0.906 (0.813 ~ 0.954), respectively. The ICCs (95 % CI) of inter-operator reproducibility of IFA, MNM angle, FMA, PL distance were 0.885 (0.663 ~ 0.953), 0.829 (0.672 ~ 0.915), 0.77 (0.511 ~ 0.891) and 0.844 (0.68 ~ 0.925), respectively. The average ± SD of IFA, MNM angle, FMA and PL distance were 80.2°±7.25°, 4.17°±1.19°, 75.36°±5.31°, 2.78 ± 0.54 mm, respectively. IFA and PL distance significantly decreased with CRL, while MNM angle and FMA significantly increased with CRL.It was feasible to measure fetal facial markers during the first trimester. In Chinese population, the reference ranges of IFA, MNM angle, FMA and PL distance were 80.2°±7.25°, 4.17°±1.19°, 75.36°±5.31°, 2.78 ± 0.54 mm, respectively, and the measurements were found to correlate with CRL.","['Facial profile', 'Fetus', 'First trimester', 'Marker', 'Ultrasonography']"
Surgical and oncological outcomes after laparoscopic <i>vs.</i> open major hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The short- and long-term prognoses are unclear following laparoscopic major hepatectomy (LMH) for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). We performed a meta-analysis to compare the surgical and oncological outcomes of LMH <i>vs</i>. open major hepatectomy (OMH) in patients with HCC.All studies comparing LMH with OMH for HCC published until April 2019 were identified independently by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We analyzed data for surgical and oncological outcomes, namely, operative time, intraoperative blood loss, blood transfusion rate, postoperative morbidity, major complications, mortality, hospital stay, margin distance, negative margin rate, long-term overall survival, and corresponding disease-free survival (DFS).We included 13 studies involving 1,225 patients with HCC (LMH: 534 patients; OMH: 691 patients) in the meta-analysis. Regarding short-term outcomes, the pooled data showed that LMH was associated with longer operative time [weighted mean difference (WMD): 72.14 min; 95% confidence interval (CI): 43.07-101.21; P<0.00001], less blood loss (WMD: -102.32 mL; 95% CI: -150.99 to -53.64; P<0.0001), shorter hospital stay (WMD: -3.77 d; 95% CI: -4.95 to -2.60; P<0.00001), lower morbidity [risk difference (RD): -0.01; 95% CI: -0.16 to -0.06; P<0.00001], and lower major complication rates (RD: -0.08; 95% CI: -0.11 to -0.05; P<0.00001). However, the need for blood transfusion (RD: -0.01; 95% CI: -0.06 to 0.05; P=0.78), mortality (RD: -0.01; 95% CI: -0.02 to 0.01; P=0.57), margin distance (WMD: 0.05 mm; 95% CI: -0.1 to 0.19; P=0.52), and negative margin rate (RD: 0.01; 95% CI: -0.03 to 0.05; P=0.65) were significantly comparable between the two groups. Regarding long-term outcomes, there was no difference in 3-year DFS [hazard ratio (HR): 0.99; 95% CI: 0.72-1.37; P=0.95], 3-year overall survival (HR: 1.25; 95% CI: 0.70-2.21; P=0.45), 5-year DFS (HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.64-1.38; P=0.76), and 5-year overall survival (HR: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.45-1.99; P=0.88).LMH can be performed as safely as OMH in select patients and provides improved short-term surgical outcomes without affecting long-term survival. However, confirming our results requires more evidence from high-quality and prospective randomized controlled trials.","['Laparoscopy', 'hepatocellular carcinoma HCC', 'major hepatectomy', 'metaanalysis', 'outcomes']"
Ex vivo corneal epithelial wound healing following exposure to ophthalmic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.,"Ketorolac 0.45% is a new formulation of topical ketorolac in which preservative (benzalkonium chloride, BAK) was removed and carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) was added to improve tolerability and reduce dosing frequency. This study compared the effects of ketorolac 0.45% on corneal wound healing to prior ketorolac formulations (0.4% and 0.5%), bromfenac 0.09%, and nepafenac 0.1%.Two parallel-group comparisons were performed in series. A 5-mm central epithelial wound was made in fresh porcine corneas. After 24 hours in minimum essential medium (MEM), corneas were incubated for 10 minutes with study drugs, Triton X-100 1% (positive control), or MEM (negative control), followed by 24 hours in MEM. The remaining wound area was stained, photographed, and quantified (pixels). Study 1 compared ketorolac 0.45% to ketorolac 0.4% and ketorolac 0.5%. Study 2 compared ketorolac 0.45% to bromfenac 0.09% and nepafenac 0.1%.The mean (±SD) original wound area was 200,506 ± 4,363 pixels, which was reduced to 59,509 ± 4850 at 48 hours after exposure to Triton X-100 1%. In study 1, the mean remaining wound areas at 48 hours in pixels were 2969 ± 1633 with MEM, 586 ± 299 with ketorolac 0.45% (significantly reduced, P < 0.05 vs all other treatments), 10,228 ± 7541 with ketorolac 0.4%, and 50,674 ± 33,409 with ketorolac 0.5% (significantly enlarged, P < 0.05 vs MEM). In study 2, the mean remaining wound areas at 48 hours were 565 ± 1263 with MEM, 322 ± 229 with ketorolac 0.45% (significantly reduced, P < 0.01 vs bromfenac 0.09% and nepafenac 0.1%), 29,093 ± 14,295 with bromfenac 0.09% (significantly enlarged, P <0.01 vs MEM) and 47,322 ± 13,736 with nepafenac 0.1% (significantly enlarged, P < 0.01 vs MEM and vs bromfenac 0.09%).Corneas treated with ketorolac 0.45% healed as rapidly as those treated with MEM, likely secondary to addition of CMC and removal of BAK. In the ex vivo corneal organ culture model, ketorolac 0.45% had statistically less impact on corneal re-epithelialization than prior ketorolac formulations (0.4% and 0.5%), bromfenac 0.09%, and nepafenac 0.01%.","['bromfenac 009', 'corneal epithelial wound healing', 'epithelial toxicity', 'ketorolac 045', 'nepafenac 01', 'ocular surgery']"
An Evaluation of Acupressure on the Sanyinjiao (SP6) and Hugo (LI4) Points on the Pain Severity and Length of Labor: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Study.,"In this study, the effects of SP6 and LI4 acupressure on the pain severity and length of labor are examined.This systematic review and meta-analysis study was performed on articles published in 2004-2015. The articles, published in the English and Farsi languages, related to the effects of acupressure on the SP6 and LI4 points on the length and pain severity of labor. Data were collected by searching medical databases, including PubMed, ISI, MagIran, Google Scholar, Iran Medex, SID, Irandoc, and EMBASE, for relevant material.Women who received SP6 acupressure experienced less pain immediately after the intervention [-0.56, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.77, -0.36] than women in the touch group and exhibited decrease in the length of labor (-0.99, 95% CI: -1.39, -0.39), the active phase (0.95, 95% CI: -1.30, -0.61), and the second stage of labor (-0.39, 95% CI: -0.74, -0.03). Women who received LI4 acupressure experienced less pain immediately after the intervention (-0.94, 95%, CI: -1.36, -0.53) than women in the touch group and exhibited shorter active phase (-0.91, 95%, CI: -1.18, -0.63) and second stage of labor (-0.55, 95%, CI: -0.95, -0.15) lengths.The use of SP6 and LI4 acupressure shows promise as a method for managing the length and pain severity of labor, but further study is required to establish its effectiveness along with other pharmacological and nonpharmacological methods.","['Hugo', 'Iran', 'Sanyinjiao', 'labor', 'metaanalysis']"
Long-term expiratory airflow of infants born moderate-late preterm: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Moderate-late preterm (MLP; 32 to <37 weeks' gestation) birth is associated with reduced expiratory airflow during child, adolescent and adult years. However, some studies have reported only minimal airflow limitation and hence it is unclear if clinical assessment in later life is warranted. Our aim was to compare maximal expiratory airflow in children and adults born MLP with term-born controls, and with expected norms.We systematically reviewed studies reporting z-scores for spirometric indices (forced expired volume in 1 second [FEV<sub>1</sub>], forced vital capacity [FVC], FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC ratio and forced expiratory flow at 25-75% of FVC [FEF<sub>25-75%</sub>]) from participants born MLP aged five years or older, with or without a term-born control group from 4 databases (MEDLINE, CINAHL, Embase, Emcare). Publications were searched for between the 22<sup>nd</sup> of September 2021 to the 29<sup>th</sup> of September 2021. A meta-analysis of eligible studies was conducted using a random effects model. The study protocol was published in PROSPERO (CRD #42021281518).We screened 4970 articles and identified 18 relevant studies, 15 of which were eligible for meta-analysis (8 with term-born controls and 7 without). Compared with controls, MLP participants had lower z-scores (mean difference [95% confidence interval] I<sup>2</sup>) for FEV<sub>1</sub>: -0.22 [-0.35, -0.09] 49.3%, FVC: -0.23 [-0.4, -0.06] 71.8%, FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC: -0.11 [-0.20 to -0.03] 9.3% and FEF<sub>25-75%</sub>: -0.27 [-0.41 to -0.12] 21.9%. Participants born MLP also had lower z-scores, on average, when compared with a z-score of 0 (mean [95% CI] I<sup>2</sup>) for FEV<sub>1</sub>: -0.26 [-0.40 to -0.11] 85.2%, FVC: -0.18 [-0.34 to -0.02] 88.3%, FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC: -0.24 [-0.43 to -0.05] 90.5% and FEF<sub>25-75%</sub>: -0.33 [-0.54 to -0.20] 94.7%.Those born MLP had worse expiratory airflows than those born at term, and compared with norms, although reductions were modest. Clinicians should be aware that children and adults born MLP may be at higher risk of obstructive lung disease compared with term-born peers.This work is supported by grants from the National Health and Medical Research Council (Centre of Research Excellence #1153176, Project grant #1161304); Medical Research Future Fund (Career Development Fellowship to J.L.Y Cheong #1141354) and from the Victorian Government's Operational Infrastructure Support Programme.

Geospatial Overlap of Undernutrition and Tuberculosis in Ethiopia.,"Undernutrition is a key driver of the global tuberculosis (TB) epidemic, yet there is limited understanding regarding the spatial overlap of both diseases. This study aimed to determine the geographical co-distribution and socio-climatic factors of undernutrition and TB in Ethiopia. Data on undernutrition were found from the Ethiopian Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS). Data on TB were obtained from the Ethiopia national TB prevalence survey. We applied a geostatistical model using a Bayesian framework to predict the prevalence of undernutrition and TB. Spatial overlap of undernutrition and TB prevalence was detected in the Afar and Somali regions. Population density was associated with the spatial distribution of TB [β: 0.008; 95% CrI: 0.001, 0.014], wasting [β: -0.017; 95% CrI: -0.032, -0.004], underweight [β: -0.02; 95% CrI: -0.031, -0.011], stunting [β: -0.012; 95% CrI: -0.017, -0.006], and adult undernutrition [β: -0.007; 95% CrI: -0.01, -0.005]. Distance to a health facility was associated with the spatial distribution of stunting [β: 0.269; 95% CrI: 0.08, 0.46] and adult undernutrition [β: 0.176; 95% CrI: 0.044, 0.308]. Healthcare access and demographic factors were associated with the spatial distribution of TB and undernutrition. Therefore, geographically targeted service integration may be more effective than nationwide service integration.","['Ethiopia', 'TB', 'geospatial overlap', 'undernutrition']"
"Meta-Analysis on the Association between Echo Intensity, Muscle Strength, and Physical Function in Older Individuals.","The use of ultrasonographic echo intensity (EI) to evaluate skeletal muscle quality and its effects on strength, explosive power, and physical function (PF) in older individuals remains unclear. This meta-analysis evaluated the associations among EI, muscle strength (MS), and PF in older individuals.We conducted a systematic search of the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, SPORT Discus, and CINAHL databases through October 2022 to identify primary studies examining the association between EI and MS/PF. Effect sizes were computed using a random-effects model and presented using forest plots. Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and I2 statistics were used to measure heterogeneity.This meta-analysis included 24 patients. EI demonstrated a negative association with maximal strength (r=-0.351; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.411 to -0.288; p&lt;0.001) and explosive power (r=-0.342; 95% CI, -0.517 to -0.139; p=0.001) in older individuals. Handgrip strength also showed a significant negative correlation with EI (r=-0.361; 95% CI, -0.463 to -0.249; p&lt;0.001). However, we observed only a small and non-significant negative association between EI and gait speed (r=-0.003; 95% CI, -0.083 to -0.077; p=0.943), and a weak non-significant correlation with the chair stand test (r=0.072; 95% CI, -0.045 to 0.187; p=0.227).Increased EI was associated with lower strength and power but not with gait speed or chair test performance in older individuals. Further large-sample studies with long-term follow-up are needed to improve frailty prediction and risk assessment in this population.","['Aging', 'Muscle strength', 'Physical functional performance', 'Ultrasonography']"
"Total hip replacement: A meta-analysis to evaluate survival of cemented, cementless and hybrid implants.","To determine whether cemented, cementless, or hybrid implant was superior to the other in terms of survival rate.Systematic searches across MEDLINE, CINAHL, and Cochrane that compared cemented, cementless and hybrid total hip replacement (THR) were performed. Two independent reviewers evaluated the risk ratios of revision due to any cause, aseptic loosening, infection, and dislocation rate of each implants with a pre-determined form. The risk ratios were pooled separately for clinical trials, cohorts and registers before pooled altogether using fixed-effect model. Meta-regressions were performed to identify the source of heterogeneity. Funnel plots were analyzed.Twenty-seven studies comprising 5 clinical trials, 9 cohorts, and 13 registers fulfilled the research criteria and analyzed. Compared to cementless THR, cemented THR have pooled RR of 0.47 (95%CI: 0.45-0.48), 0.9 (0.84-0.95), 1.29 (1.06-1.57) and 0.69 (0.6-0.79) for revision due to any reason, revision due to aseptic loosening, revision due to infection, and dislocation respectively. Compared to hybrid THR, the pooled RRs of cemented THR were 0.82 (0.76-0.89), 2.65 (1.14-6.17), 0.98 (0.7-1.38), and 0.67 (0.57-0.79) respectively. Compared to hybrid THR, cementless THR had RRs of 0.7 (0.65-0.75), 0.85 (0.49-1.5), 1.47 (0.93-2.34) and 1.13 (0.98-1.3).Despite the limitations in this study, there was some tendency that cemented fixation was still superior than other types of fixation in terms of implant survival.","['Cemented', 'Cementless', 'Hybrid', 'Implant survival', 'Metaanalysis', 'Total hip replacement']"
Electroacupuncture modulates the activity of the hippocampus-nucleus tractus solitarius-vagus nerve pathway to reduce myocardial ischemic injury.,"The hippocampus is involved in the regulation of the autonomic nervous system, together with the hypothalamus and brainstem nuclei, such as the paraventricular nucleus and nucleus tractus solitarius. The vagus nerve-nucleus tractus solitarius pathway has an important role in cardiovascular reflex regulation. Myocardial ischemia has been shown to cause changes in the autonomic nervous system, affecting the dynamic equilibrium of the sympathetic and vagal nerves. However, it remains poorly understood how the hippocampus communicates with brainstem nuclei to regulate the autonomic nervous system and alleviate myocardial ischemic tissue damage. A rat model of acute myocardial ischemia (AMI) was made by ligating the left anterior descending branch of the coronary artery. Three days before ischemia, the hippocampal CA1 region was damaged. Then, 3 days after ischemia, electroacupuncture (EA) at Shenmen (HT7)-Tongli (HT5) was performed (continuous wave, 1 mA, 2 Hz, duration of 30 minutes). Cluster analysis of firing patterns showed that one type of neuron was found in rats in the sham and AMI groups. Three types of neurons were observed in the AMI + EA group. Six types of neurons were found in the AMI + EA + Lesion group. Correlation analysis showed that the frequency of vagus nerve discharge in each group was negatively correlated with heart rate (HR) (P < 0.05, r = -0.424), and positively correlated with mean arterial pressure (MAP) (P < 0.05, r = 0.40987) and the rate-pressure product (RPP) (P < 0.05, r = 0.4252). The total frequency of the nucleus tractus solitarius discharge in each group was positively correlated with vagus nerve discharge (P < 0.01, r = 0.7021), but not with hemodynamic index (HR: P > 0.05, r = -0.03263; MAP: P > 0.05, r = -0.08993; RPP: P > 0.05, r = -0.03263). Some neurons (Neuron C) were negatively correlated with vagus nerve discharge, HR, MAP and RPP in the AMI + EA group (vagus nerve discharge: P < 0.05, r = -0.87749; HR: P < 0.01, r = -0.91902; MAP: P < 0.05, r = -0.85691; RPP: P < 0.01, r = -0.91902). Some neurons (Neurons C, D and E) were positively correlated with vagus nerve discharge, HR, MAP and RPP in the AMI + EA + Lesion group (vagus nerve discharge: P < 0.01, r = 0.8905, P < 0.01, r = 0.9725, P < 0.01, r = 0.9054; HR: P < 0.01, r = 0.9347, P < 0.01, r = 0.9089, P < 0.05, r = 0.8247; MAP: P < 0.05, r = 0.8474, P < 0.01, r = 0.9691, P < 0.01, r = 0.9027; RPP: P < 0.05, r = 0.8637, P < 0.01, r = 0.9407, P < 0.01, r = 0.9027). These findings show that the hippocampus-nucleus tractus solitarius-vagus nerve pathway is involved in the cardioprotective effect of EA at the heart meridian.

Bayesian hierarchical model-based network meta-analysis to overcome survival extrapolation challenges caused by data immaturity.,"<b>Aim:</b> This research evaluated standard Weibull mixture cure (WMC) network meta-analysis (NMA) with Bayesian hierarchical (BH) WMC NMA to inform long-term survival of therapies. <b>Materials & methods:</b> Four trials in previously treated metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer with PD-L1 >1% were used comparing docetaxel with nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab. Cure parameters related to a certain treatment class were assumed to share a common distribution. <b>Results:</b> Standard WMC NMA predicted cure rates were 0.03 (0.01; 0.07), 0.18 (0.12; 0.24), 0.07 (0.02; 0.15) and 0.03 (0.00; 0.09) for docetaxel, nivolumab, pembrolizumab and atezolizumab, respectively, with corresponding incremental life years (LY) of 3.11 (1.65; 4.66), 1.06 (0.41; 2.37) and 0.42 (-0.57; 1.68). The Bayesian hierarchical-WMC-NMA rates were 0.06 (0.03; 0.10), 0.17 (0.11; 0.23), 0.12 (0.05; 0.20) and 0.12 (0.03; 0.23), respectively, with incremental LY of 2.35 (1.04; 3.93), 1.67 (0.68; 2.96) and 1.36 (-0.05; 3.64). <b>Conclusion:</b> BH-WMC-NMA impacts incremental mean LYs and cost-effectiveness ratios, potentially affecting reimbursement decisions.","['bayesian hierarchical modelling', 'immunotherapies', 'indirect treatment comparisons', 'mixture cure', 'network metaanalysis', 'oncology', 'survival extrapolation']"
"Urban green space, tree canopy and prevention of cardiometabolic diseases: a multilevel longitudinal study of 46 786 Australians.","Cross-sectional studies suggest that more green space may lower the odds of prevalent diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular diseases (CVD) in cities. We assess if these results are replicable for tree canopy exposure and then extend the study longitudinally to examine incident cardiometabolic outcomes.The study was set in the Australian cities of Sydney, Wollongong and Newcastle. Total green space and tree canopy as percentages of landcover within 1.6 km (1 mile) from home were linked to a residentially stable sample of 46 786 participants in the Sax Institute's 45 and Up Study (baseline 2006-09; follow-up 2012-15). Separate multilevel models were used to investigate whether the odds of prevalent and incident doctor-diagnosed diabetes, hypertension and CVD were associated with total green space and tree canopy provision, adjusting for age, sex, income, education, employment and couple status.Lower odds of prevalent diabetes were observed with 1% increases in total green space [odds ratio (OR) 0.993, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.988 to 0.998] and tree canopy (0.984, 0.978 to 0.989). Lower odds of prevalent CVD were found with a 1% increase in tree canopy only (0.996, 0.993 to 0.999). Lower odds of incident diabetes (0.988, 0.981 to 0.994), hypertension (0.993, 0.989 to 0.997) and CVD (0.993, 0.988 to 0.998) were associated with a 1% increase in tree canopy, but not total green space. At ≥30% compared with 0-9% tree canopy, there were lower odds of incident diabetes (0.687, 0.547 to 0.855), hypertension (0.828, 0.719 to 0.952) and CVD (0.782, 0.652 to 0.935). However, ≥30% compared with 0-4% total green space was associated with lower odds of prevalent diabetes only (0.695, 0.512 to 0.962).Restoring local tree canopy in neighbourhoods may help to prevent the incidence of cardiometabolic diseases.","['Diabetes', 'cardiovascular diseases', 'green space', 'hypertension', 'tree canopy']"
Orange juice intake and anthropometric changes in children and adolescents.,"Evaluate associations between orange juice (OJ) consumption and anthropometric parameters.Prospective cohort study assessing the association between OJ intake and changes in BMI and height-for-age Z-score (HAZ) using mixed linear regression.2004-2008, USA.Children from the Growing Up Today Study II (n 7301), aged 9-16 years at enrollment.OJ consumption was positively associated with 2-year change in HAZ in girls (mean (se)): 0·03 (0·01) for non-consumers, 0·03 (0·02) for 1-3 glasses/month, 0·06 (0·01) for 1-6 glasses/week and 0·09 (0·02) for ≥1 glass/d after full adjustment (Ptrend = 0·02). However, OJ consumption was not associated with 2-year change in BMI percentile (kg/m2, mean (se)): -0·44 (0·36) for non-consumers, 0·20 (0·41) for 1-3 glasses/month, -0·04 (0·34) for 1-6 glasses/week and -0·77 (0·62) for ≥1 glass/d in girls, Ptrend = 0·81; -0·94 (0·53) for non-consumers, -1·68 (0·52) for 1-3 glasses/month, -0·81 (0·38) for 1-6 glasses per week and -1·12 (0·61) for ≥1 glass/d in boys, Ptrend = 0·49.OJ consumption was favourably associated with height growth but unrelated to excess weight gain. OJ may be a useful alternative to whole fruit in the event that whole fruit intake is insufficient.","['BMI percentile', 'Children', 'Growing up today study', 'Heightforage Zscore', 'Orange juice']"
Differences in the Force Velocity Mechanical Profile and the Effectiveness of Force Application During Sprint-Acceleration Between Sprinters and Hurdlers.,"This cross-sectional study aimed to compare the horizontal and vertical force-velocity profile between female sprinters and hurdlers. Twelve high-level athletes (6 sprinters and 6 hurdlers) participated in this investigation. The testing procedures consisted of two maximal 40-m sprints and five to six vertical jumps with additional loads. For the sprint-acceleration performance, the velocity-time data, recorded by a high-speed camera, was used to calculate the variables of the horizontal F-V profile (theoretical maximal values of force [<i>HZT-F</i> <sub>0</sub>], velocity [<i>HZT-V</i> <sub>0</sub>], power [<i>HZT-Pmax</i>], the proportion of the theoretical maximal effectiveness of force application in the antero-posterior direction [<i>RFmax</i>], and the rate of decrease in the ratio of horizontal force [<i>DRF</i>]). The best trial of each vertical jumping condition, obtained by an optical measurement system, was used to determine the components of the vertical F-V profile (theoretical maximal values of force [<i>VTC-F</i> <sub>0</sub>], velocity [<i>VTC-V</i> <sub>0</sub>], and power [<i>VTC-Pmax</i>]). The female sprinters showed higher statistical differences for <i>HZT-Pmax</i> (2.46 ± 0.67, <i>d</i> = 2.1, <i>p</i> = 0.004), <i>HZT-V</i> <sub>0</sub> (0.45 ± 0.18, <i>d</i> = 1.4, <i>p</i> = 0.03), and <i>RFmax%</i> (2.9 ± 0.9%, <i>d</i> = 1.8, <i>p</i> = 0.01) than female hurdlers. No statistical differences were observed for <i>HZT-F</i> <sub>0</sub> (0.69 ± 0.3, <i>d</i> = 1.15, <i>p</i> = 0.07), <i>DRF%</i> (-0.24 ± 0.4%, <i>d</i> = 0.3, <i>p</i> = 0.62), <i>VTC-F</i> <sub>0</sub> (-2.1 ± 3.8, <i>d</i> = 0.3, <i>p</i> = 0.59), <i>VTC-V</i> <sub>0</sub> (0.25 ± 0.31, <i>d</i> = 0.5, <i>p</i> = 0.45), and <i>VTC-Pmax</i> (1.75 ± 2.5, <i>d</i> = 0.4, <i>p</i> = 0.5). Female sprinters are able to apply higher horizontally-oriented forces onto the ground during the acceleration phase than female hurdlers.","['biomechanics of hurdling', 'forcevelocity profile', 'ratio of force application', 'sprint mechanics', 'sprint performance']"
The optimum valine: lysine ratios on performance and carcass traits of male broilers based on different regression approaches.,"Three different regression approaches were applied to determine the optimal digestible (d.) and analyzed Val:Lys ratios for broiler performance and carcass yield. One-day-old male Cobb 500 broilers (n = 960) were assigned to 1 of 8 diets, with 6 pens/diet and 20 birds/pen, for 42 days. The negative control consisted of the basal diet with a d.Val:d.Lys ratio of 0.63 and with 93% of the required d.Lys. The positive control consisted of the basal diet with a d.Val:d.Lys of 0.80, with no reduction in d.Lys content. The other (test) diets contained a range of d.Val:d.Lys ratios, all with 93% of the required d.Lys. Data on feed intake (FI), body weight gain (BWG), and feed conversion ratio (FCR) were submitted to regression analysis, applying quadratic polynomial (QP), exponential asymptotic (EA), and linear response plateau (LRP) models. Since Val did not affect carcass or breast meat yield, no regression was performed. Digestible and analyzed Val:Lys ratios were similar based on the regression models. The intercept between the QP and LRP models was used to determine the optimum Val:Lys ratio. Overall, the ideal d.Val:d.Lys ratio will vary according to the main goal of poultry production, i.e., BWG or FCR. For BWG, the ideal ratio was found to be 0.78 (0 to 12 d), 0.73 (0 to 28 d), and 0.76 (0 to 35 or 0 to 42 d). For FCR, the optimum d.Val:d.Lys was found to be 0.80 (0 to 12 d), 0.75 (0 to 28 d), and 0.78 (0 to 35 or 0 to 42 d). The optimum analyzed Val:Lys ratio was slightly higher. For instance, for BWG the optimum ratio was 0.80 (0 to 12 d), 0.76 (0 to 28 d), and 0.79 (0 to 35 or 0 to 42 d). For FCR, the optimum Val:Lys was 0.81 (0 to 12 d), 0.79 (0 to 28 d), and 0.81 (0 to 35 or 0 to 42 d). Valine did not affect carcass or breast meat yield.","['Cobb 500', 'amino acid', 'exponential asymptotic', 'linear response plateau', 'quadratic polynomial']"
Two-year results of femtosecond assisted LASIK versus PRK for different severity of astigmatism.,"To compare two-year results of femtosecond laser assisted LASIK (femto-LASIK) and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) in terms of astigmatism correction in patients with less than 2.0 diopters (D) of spherical error and more than 2.0 D of cylinder error.In this retrospective study, data were extracted from 100 patient charts. The two study groups were matched by age, gender, and baseline uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) and refractive astigmatism (RA). Preoperative astigmatism was categorized as mild: 2.00 to <3.00 D, moderate: 3.00 to <4.00 D, and severe: ≥4.00 D.Mean RA in the femto-LASIK and PRK groups was respectively -3.15 ± 0.94 D (-7.00 to -2.00 D) and -3.29 ± 0.95 D (-6.25 to -2.00 D) at baseline (<i>P</i> = 0.284), and -0.61 ± 0.40 D and -0.62 ± 0.60 D one year after surgery (<i>P</i> = 0.674), but significantly lower in the femto-LASIK group (-0.61 ± 0.39 vs. -0.83 ± 0.56 D, <i>P</i> = 0.021) at 2 years when the rate of residual astigmatism more than 1.0 D was 6.3% in the femto-LASIK and 19.6% in the PRK group (<i>P</i> = 0.046). Mean UDVA in the femto-LASIK group (0.02 ± 0.05 logMAR) was better than the PRK group (0.06 ± 0.10 logMAR) (<i>P</i> = 0.025). Mean corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) was not significantly different between groups (0.01 ± 0.03 vs. 0.01 ± 0.04 logMAR, <i>P</i> = 0.714). Both groups had 1-4 Snellen lines CDVA improvement. The three subgroups of baseline astigmatism did not differ significantly in terms of residual astigmatism (all <i>P</i> > 0.05). However, in subgroups with ≥4.00 D cylinder, there was less astigmatic regression at 1 year in the femto-LASIK group (0.28 ± 0.43 D) than the PRK group (0.54 ± 0.68 D) (<i>P</i> = 0.007).Our results pointed to better two-year results with femto-LASIK in the treatment of different degrees of astigmatism. UDVA improvement was superior with femto-LASIK, but the two methods did not significantly differ in terms of CDVA improvement.","['Femtosecond assisted LASIK', 'High astigmatism', 'PRKMMC']"
The Effect of Social Support on Athlete Burnout in Weightlifters: The Mediation Effect of Mental Toughness and Sports Motivation.,"<b>Objectives:</b> Athlete burnout is a crucial concern affecting the development and athletic performance of young weightlifters. To reduce or relieve the prevalence of athlete burnout, this study examined the relationship across social support, sports motivation, mental toughness, and athlete burnout in weightlifters. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 315 weightlifters aged 17-28 years old (151 males, 164 females; <i>M</i> <sub><i>age</i></sub> = 18.89 years, <i>SD</i> = 3.66) from Sichuan, Chongqing, and Shanxi in China participated in this survey. The Perceived Available Support in Sport Questionnaire (PASS-Q), Sports Motivation Questionnaire (SMQ), Sports Mental Toughness Questionnaire (SMTQ), and Athlete Burnout Questionnaire (ABQ) were used in this study. SPSS Statistics 19.0, AMOS 21.0, and PROCESS 3.0 macro were used to analyze the collected data. <b>Results:</b> The results indicated that weightlifters' social support could negatively significantly affect athlete burnout [beta = -0.398; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.3699, -0.2184; <i>P</i> < 0.05) <i>via</i> mental toughness and sports motivation. The mediation analysis revealed that they had partial mediating effect, including three paths: First, social support had a direct effect on athlete burnout (beta = -0.150; 95% CI: -0.1824, -0.0397; <i>P</i> < 0.05); second, sport mental toughness had a mediating effect on athlete burnout (beta = -0.113; 95% CI: -0.1703, -0.0631; <i>P</i> < 0.05); and finally, sports motivation had a mediating effect on athlete burnout (beta = -0.124; 95% CI: -0.1751, -0.0793; <i>P</i> < 0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> The findings revealed that social support could inhibit or prevent athlete burnout <i>via</i> mental toughness and sports motivation; thus, to decrease or relieve the prevalence of burnout in weightlifters, it is an important solution to enhance their social support.","['athlete burnout', 'mental toughness', 'social support', 'sports motivation', 'weightlifter']"
"The relationships between cortisol levels, insulin levels, and thyroid hormones with 24-h urinary sodium excretion in never treated essential hypertensive patients.","To study the relationship between cortisol, insulin, and thyroid hormone levels with 24-h urinary sodium (Na) excretion levels in essential hypertensive patients.All patients underwent history taking, physical examination, blood pressure (BP) measurement, 12 lead electocardiographic evaluation, routine urine analysis, biochemical analysis including measurement of cortisol, insulin, and thyroid hormone levels, 24-h urine collection to measure urinary Na and protein excretion and creatinine clearance.In total, 68 newly diagnosed hypertensive patients were included. Spearman correlation analysis revealed that 24-h urinary Na excretion was correlated with insulin levels (ρ = -0.473, P < 0.0001), serum cortisol levels (ρ = -0.404, P = 0.0010) and creatinine clearance (ρ = 0.407, P = 0.0010). Linear regression of independent factors has revealed that systolic BP (B = 0.004, CI = 0.001-0.008, P = 0.0170), body mass index (B = 0.014, CI = 0.005-0.023, P = 0.0030), being male (B = 0.077, CI = 0.001-0.153, P = 0.0480), creatinine clearance (B = 0.003, CI = 0.001-0.006, P = 0.0120) and insulin levels (B = -0.008, CI = -0.014 to -0.002, P = 0.0070) were independently related with logarithmically converted 24-h Na excretion.In conclusion, we found that insulin but not cortisol and thyroid hormone levels were independently related with 24-h urinary Na excretion in newly diagnosed essential hypertensive patients.","['Cortisol', 'Hypertension Insulin', 'Sodium', 'Thyroid']"
Correlation and pathways of behavioral activation systems mediating physical activity level and depressive symptoms among college students.,"Depression is a common mental disorder among college students. The main symptoms include being persistent low mood, sad emotional experiences, lack of pleasure, listlessness, and impaired cognitive function accompanied by tendencies of self-harm and suicide.To clarify the pathways and effects of the behavioral activation system between physical activity and depressive symptoms in college students with depressive symptoms.This cross-sectional research screened 3047 college students. Of these, 472 had depressive symptoms, with a depression detection rate of 15.49%. Furthermore, 442 college students with depressive symptoms were analyzed. A one-way analysis of variance and Pearson's correlation, linear regression, and structural equation modeling analyses were used to explore the correlations and pathways of the interactions between the variables.Depressive symptoms were significantly negatively correlated with physical activity (r = -0.175, <i>P</i> < 0.001), the behavioral activation system (r = -0.197, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and drive (r = -0.113, <i>P</i> = 0.017). Furthermore, it was negatively correlated with fun-seeking (FS) (r = -0.055, <i>P</i> = 0.251); however, it was not significant. Physical activity was significantly positively correlated with reward responsiveness (RR) (r = 0.141, <i>P</i> = 0.003) and drive (r = 0.124, <i>P</i> = 0.009) and not significantly positively correlated with FS (r = 0.090, <i>P</i> = 0.058). The mediating effect of RR between physical activity and depressive symptoms was significant [B = -0.025, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): -0.051 to -0.008, <i>P</i> = 0.001]. The direct and total effects of physical activity on depressive symptoms and were significant (B = -0.150, 95%CI: -0.233 to -0.073, <i>P</i> < 0.001; B = -0.175, 95%CI: -0.260 to -0.099, <i>P</i> < 0.001), respectively.As physical activity levels increased, depression scores among college students decreased. The mediating effect of RR between physical activity and depressive symptoms was significant. Therefore, colleges and universities should encourage college students with depression to increase their physical activity and improve their behavioral activation system. Particular attention should be paid to RR, which may reduce the prevalence of depressive symptoms.","['Behavioral activation system', 'College students', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Mediating role', 'Physical activity']"
Autofluorescence imaging endoscopy for identification and assessment of inflammatory ulcerative colitis.,"To validate the clinical relevance of autofluorescence imaging (AFI) endoscopy for the assessment of inflammatory ulcerative colitis (UC).A total of 572 endoscopic images were selected from 42 UC patients: 286 taken with white light imaging (WLI) and 286 with AFI from the same sites. WLI images were assessed for overall mucosal inflammation according to Mayo endoscopic subscore (MES), and for seven characteristic endoscopic features. Likewise, AFI photographs were scored according to relative abundance of red, green and blue color components within each image based on an RGB additive color model. WLI and AFI endoscopic scores from the same sites were compared. Histological evaluation of biopsies was according to the Riley Index.Relative to red (r = 0.52, P < 0.01) or blue (r = 0.56, P < 0.01) color component, the green color component of AFI (r = -0.62, P < 0.01) corresponded more closely with mucosal inflammation sites. There were significant differences in green color components between MES-0 (0.396 ± 0.043) and MES-1 (0.340 ± 0.035) (P < 0.01), and between MES-1 and ≥ MES-2 (0.318 ± 0.037) (P < 0.01). The WLI scores for ""vascular patterns"" (r = -0.65, P < 0.01), ""edema"" (r = -0.62, P < 0.01), histology scores for ""polymorphonuclear cells in the lamina propria"" (r = -0.51, P < 0.01) and ""crypt architectural irregularities"" (r = -0.51, P < 0.01) showed correlation with the green color component of AFI. There were significant differences in green color components between limited (0.399 ± 0.042) and extensive (0.375 ± 0.044) (P = 0.014) polymorphonuclear cell infiltration within MES-0. As the severity of the mucosal inflammation increased, the green color component of AFI decreased. The AFI green color component was well correlated with the characteristic endoscopic and histological inflammatory features of UC.AFI has application in detecting inflammatory lesions, including microscopic activity in the colonic mucosa of UC patients, based on the green color component of images.","['Autofluorescence imaging endoscopy', 'Endoscopic activity', 'Green color component', 'Histological activity', 'Microscopic inflammation']"
"Efficacy, acceptability and side-effects of oral versus long-acting- injectables antipsychotics: Systematic review and network meta-analysis.","Long-acting injectable antipsychotics (LAIs) are primarily used for relapse prevention, but in some settings and situations, they may also be useful for acute treatment of schizophrenia. We conducted a systematic review and frequentist network meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials (RCTs), focusing on adult patients in the acute phase of schizophrenia. Interventions were risperidone, paliperidone, aripiprazole, olanzapine, and placebo, administered either orally or as LAI. We synthesized data on overall symptoms, complemented by 17 other efficacy and tolerability outcomes. Confidence in the evidence was assessed with the Confidence-in-Network-Meta-Analysis-framework (CINeMA). We included 115 RCTs with 25,550 participants. All drugs were significantly more efficacious than placebo with the following standardized mean differences and their 95 % confidence intervals: olanzapine LAI -0.66 [-1.00; -0.33], risperidone LAI -0.59[-0.73;-0.46], olanzapine oral -0.55[-0.62;-0.48], aripiprazole LAI -0.54[-0.71; -0.37], risperidone oral -0.48[-0.55;-0.41], paliperidone oral -0.47[-0.58;-0.37], paliperidone LAI -0.45[-0.57;-0.33], aripiprazole oral -0.40[-0.50; -0.31]. There were no significant efficacy differences between LAIs and oral formulations. Sensitivity analyses of the primary outcome overall symptoms largely confirmed these findings. Moreover, some side effects were less frequent under LAIs than under their oral counterparts. Confidence in the evidence was moderate for most comparisons. LAIs are efficacious for acute schizophrenia and may have some benefits compared to oral formulations in terms of side effects. These findings assist clinicians with insights to weigh the risks and benefits between oral and injectable agents when treating patients in the acute phase.","['Acute schizophrenia', 'Longacting injectable antipsychotics', 'Network metaanalysis', 'Oral antipsychotics']"
Values of prognostic nutritional index for predicting Kawasaki disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the relationship between the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) resistance and coronary artery lesion (CAL) in Kawasaki disease (KD).The relevant literature was searched on PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Google Scholar up to August 5, 2023. A pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under curve (AUC) were calculated to assess the predicted values of PNI in KD patients with IVIG resistance and CAL.A total of 8 articles containing 10 studies involving 7,047 participants were included. The pooled results revealed a pooled sensitivity of 0.44 (0.25-0.65), a pooled specificity of 0.87 (0.73-0.94), a pooled PLR of 3.4 (2.0-5.9), a pooled NLR of 0.65 (0.48-0.87), a pooled DOR of 5.26 (2.76-10.02), and a pooled AUC of 0.75 (0.71-0.78) in the diagnosis of KD with CAL. The pooled results suggested that a pooled sensitivity was 0.69 (0.60-0.77), specificity was 0.76 (0.69-0.82), PLR was 2.9 (2.1-4.1), NLR was 0.40 (0.29-0.56), DOR was 7.27 (3.89-13.59), and AUC was 0.79 (0.75-0.82) in the diagnosis of KD with IVIG resistance. The combined results revealed the pooled sensitivity was 0.63 (0.58-0.67), specificity was 0.82 (0.80-0.83), PLR was 3.09 (1.06-8.98), NLR was 0.38 (0.07-2.02), DOR was 8.23 (0.81-83.16) in differentiating KD from febrile patients. These findings demonstrated low sensitivity and relatively high specificity of PNI for KD, KD-CAL, and IVIG-resistant KD.In conclusion, this study was the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the diagnostic value of PNI in KD with IVIG resistance and CAL. The results suggested that PNI could be used as biomarkers for distinguish KD, KD with CAL, and KD with IVIG resistance.","['Kawasaki disease', 'coronary artery lesion', 'intravenous immunoglobulin resistance', 'metaanalysis', 'prognostic nutritional index']"
"Association between interpersonal relations and anxiety, depression symptoms, and suicidal ideation among middle school students.","This study aimed to explore the relationship between different types of interpersonal relationships and anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation and discusses the impact of different grades among middle school students.The Patient Health Questionnaire Depression Scale, the Chinese version of the Generalized Anxiety Scale, suicidal ideation questions, and interpersonal relations items were used to measure the depression symptoms, anxiety symptoms, suicidal ideation, and interpersonal relations of the participants. The variables of anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and interpersonal relations were screened using the Chi-square test and principal component analysis. AMOS17.0 constructs the path of the association between interpersonal relations and depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and suicidal ideation.The mother-child relationship had direct impacts of -0.06, -0.07, and -0.06 on anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation. On anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation, the direct impacts of the father-child relationship were -0.09, -0.03, and -0.08. Moreover, the direct effects of peer relationships on depressive symptoms were -0.04, whereas the direct impact of teacher-student relationships on anxiety and depressive symptoms were -0.10 and -0.09. Further pathway analysis based on grade level showed that in the junior high school model, the direct effect of the mother-child relationship on anxiety and depressive symptoms was -0.18 and -0.16. The direct impact of the father-child relationship on depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation was -0.08 and 0.09. The direct effect of peer relationships on depressive symptoms was -0.08, and the direct impact of the teacher-student relationship on anxiety symptoms was -0.06. In the high school model, the direct effect of the mother-child relationship on suicidal ideation was -0.07, while the direct impact of the father-child relationship on anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation was -0.10, -0.07, and -0.12, respectively. In addition, the direct effects of peer relationships on anxiety and depression were -0.06 and -0.05, and the direct impact of teacher-student relationships on anxiety and depression was -0.10 and -0.11.The father-child relationship affects suicidal ideation and depression the most, followed by the mother-child relationship, the teacher-student interaction, and the peer relationship. The teacher-student relationship influences anxiety symptoms the most, followed by the father-child and mother-child relationships. The association between interpersonal interactions and anxiety, depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation varied significantly across grade levels.","['anxiety symptoms', 'depressive symptoms', 'interpersonal relations', 'middle school students', 'suicidal ideation']"
Influence of common health disorders on the length of productive life and stayability in German Holstein cows.,"The aim of this study was to infer phenotypic and genetic effects of health disorders on longevity traits, considering Holstein dairy cow records from large-scale co-operator herds. In this regard, we focused on 13 different disease traits and on 2 longevity definitions: length of productive life (LPL) and stayability (STAY). The LPL was defined as the interval in days from first calving to culling. For LPL, we considered 90,215 cows with known culling dates. For binary STAY, we defined 3 survival stages in the first 3 lactations: from calving to DIM 59, from DIM 60 to DIM 299, and from DIM 300 to the next calving date. Due to the earlier trait recording possibilities, 129,386 cows were considered for the STAY analysis. Accordingly, the presence or absence of diseases in lactation stages were defined as binary traits. A further data set for the 90,215 cows with a culling date included the subjective culling reasons defined by farmers. Comparison of culling reasons, as defined by farmers, with diagnoses from the disease data set indicated some disagreements. For example, only 18.71% of the cows with the farmer culling reason ""metabolic diseases"" were diagnosed with a metabolic disorder. Better agreements were identified for mastitis (84.09%). Phenotypically, in most cases, occurrence of diseases at different lactation stages had negative influence on LPL and STAY. In this regard, we identified strong detrimental effects of clinical mastitis and of metabolic disorders from early lactation stages on longevity traits. For example, the presence of clinical mastitis in the first stage of first lactation was associated with LPL decrease of 95.35 d. Using generalized linear mixed models for binary health disorders, heritabilities ranged from <0.01 (±0.079 standard error) for ruminal acidosis early in first, second, and third lactation to 0.24 (±0.039) for interdigital hyperplasia from the last stage in third lactation. Heritabilities from single-trait and bivariate animal models ranged from 0.03 (±0.003) to 0.10 (±0.007) for LPL, and from 0.01 (±0.002) to 0.06 (±0.007) for STAY. Genetic correlations between longevity traits and health disorders were mostly negative (i.e., favorable in a breeding sense). For improvements to longevity genetic evaluations for young bulls with a limited number of daughter culling dates, we suggest consideration of health traits from a well-organized co-operator herd monitoring system as early longevity predictors, especially for censored data. Genetic correlations between mastitis from different lactation stages with LPL and STAY ranged from -0.28 (±0.07) to -0.69 (±0.05), and from -0.26 (±0.08) to -0.77 (±0.08), respectively. Interestingly, only diagnoses for dermatitis digitalis showed opposite results phenotypically and genetically. Strong genetic associations between ruminal acidosis and STAY were observed (genetic correlations: -0.48 ± 0.18 to -0.98 ± 0.31), supporting the inferred phenotypic associations. Genetic correlations between longevity traits LPL and STAY were quite large, between 0.77 (±0.11) and 0.94 (±0.02) for the different lactation stages, suggesting utility of early STAY information when attempting genetic improvements for longevity.","['genetic parameter', 'health disorder', 'longevity', 'subjective culling reason']"
Venous collaterals in acute ischemic stroke patients after endovascular treatments: a novel scoring system using 4D computed tomography angiography.,"To establish a novel cortical venous collateral score based on four-dimensional computed tomography angiography (4D CTA) and to assess the relationship between the score and clinical outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) after endovascular treatments (EVTs).This was a retrospective case-control study designed to evaluate all consecutive patients with large vessel occlusion in unilateral anterior circulation who underwent EVTs at a single institution. Two independent neuroradiologists evaluated venous collaterals using different venous collateral scores: a cortical venous collateral score based on 4D CTA (4D-VCS), the prognostic evaluation based on cortical vein score difference in stroke (PRECISE) score, and the cortical vein opacification score (COVES). Spearman correlation analysis was used to analyze the correlation of different venous collateral scoring systems with final infarct volume (FIV), modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score, and artery collateral score. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the prognostic value of each model. The areas under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the 6 models were compared by the DeLong test.A total of 107 patients were enrolled in the study. The AUC of 4D-VCS was 0.92 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.85 to 0.96; P<0.0001]. The 4D-VCS was highly correlated with FIV (r=-0.615; 95% CI: -0.737 to -0.473; P<0.001), mRS score (r=-0.706; 95% CI: -0.789 to -0.602; P<0.001), and arterial collateral score (r=0.769; 95% CI: 0.678 to 0.838; P<0.001). There were statistically significant differences between model 1 (AUC, 0.89; 95% CI: 0.81 to 0.94) and model 2 (AUC, 0.94; 95% CI: 0.88 to 0.98) (P=0.025), model 1 (AUC, 0.89; 95% CI: 0.81 to 0.94) and model 3 (AUC, 0.93; 95% CI: 0.87 to 0.97) (P=0.045), model 1 (AUC, 0.89; 95% CI: 0.81 to 0.94) and model 6 (AUC, 0.95; 95% CI: 0.89 to 0.98) (P=0.011), and model 2 (AUC, 0.94; 95% CI: 0.88 to 0.98) and model 5 (AUC, 0.89; 95% CI: 0.82 to 0.94) (P=0.032).The findings of this study suggested that 4D-VCS, a novel measurement of venous enhancement based on 4D CTA, may be accurately used to identify AIS patients with high risk of poor clinical outcome after EVTs.","['Brain ischemia', 'angiography', 'collateral circulation', 'computed tomography', 'ischemic stroke']"
Potential Effectiveness of Chinese Patent Medicine <i>Tongxinluo Capsule</i> for Secondary Prevention After Acute Myocardial Infarction: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"<b>Background:</b> Chinese patent medicine <i>Tongxinluo capsule</i> (<i>TXL</i>) is commonly used for cardio-cerebrovascular diseases. Previous research had demonstrated that <i>TXL</i> exhibited great clinical effects on the treatment of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), however there is a lack of systematic review. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential effectiveness and safety of <i>TXL</i> for secondary prevention in patients with AMI. <b>Method:</b> We searched 6 databases to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from inceptions to December 30, 2017. Two review authors independently assessed the methodological quality and analyzed data by the RevMan 5.3 software. The publication bias was assessed through funnel plot and Begg's test. The Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach was used for evaluating the quality of evidence. <b>Results:</b> We included 19 RCTs in this review and performed a meta-analysis based on 16 studies. There were statistical differences of <i>TXL</i> treatment group in reducing primary cardiovascular events (cardiac death [RR = 0.27, 95%CI: 0.08~0.95, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0%], recurrent myocardial reinfarction [RR = 0.38, 95%CI: 0.20~0.74, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0%], arrhythmia [RR = 0.44, 95%CI: 0.30~0.66, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0%], recurrent angina pectoris [RR = 0.34, 95%CI: 0.17~0.69, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0%]). <i>TXL</i> could improve cardiac function (LVEF [MD = 4.10, 95%CI: 3.95~4.25, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0%]), regulate blood lipid TC [MD = -0.66, 95%CI: -0.94 ~ -0.37, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 74%], TG [MD = -0.38, 95%CI: -0.62 ~ -0.14, I<sup>2</sup> = 70%], LDL-C[-0.40, 95%CI: -0.65 ~ -0.16, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 88%), decrease the level of hs-CRP (4-week: MD = -0.78, 95%CI: -0.97 ~ -0.60, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 20%; Over 4-week: MD = -1.36, 95%CI: -1.55 ~ -1.17, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 20%). However, <i>TXL</i> has little effects on revascularization [RR = 0.45, 95%CI: 0.13~1.56, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0%], recurrent heart failure (RR = 0.83, 95%CI: 0.27~2.57, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0%), and HDL-C (MD = 0.14, 95%CI: 0.00 ~0.29, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 73%). Furthermore, <i>TXL</i> treatment group was more prone to suffer gastrointestinal discomfort. <b>Conclusion:</b> Chinese patent medicine <i>TXL</i> seemed beneficial for secondary prevention after AMI. This potential benefit needs to be further assessed through more rigorous RCTs.

Assessing the effects of interventions for Aedes aegypti control: systematic review and meta-analysis of cluster randomised controlled trials.,"The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the vector for dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya, and zika viruses. Inadequate vector control has contributed to persistence and increase of these diseases. This review assesses the evidence of effectiveness of different control measures in reducing Aedes aegypti proliferation, using standard entomological indices.A systematic search of Medline, Ovid, BVS, LILACS, ARTEMISA, IMBIOMED and MEDIGRAPHIC databases identified cluster randomised controlled trials (CRCTs) of interventions to control Aedes aegypti published between January 2003 and October 2016. Eligible studies were CRCTs of chemical or biological control measures, or community mobilization, with entomological indices as an endpoint. A meta-analysis of eligible studies, using a random effects model, assessed the impact on household index (HI), container index (CI), and Breteau index (BI).From 848 papers identified by the search, eighteen met the inclusion criteria: eight for chemical control, one for biological control and nine for community mobilisation. Seven of the nine CRCTs of community mobilisation reported significantly lower entomological indices in intervention than control clusters; findings from the eight CRCTs of chemical control were more mixed. The CRCT of biological control reported a significant impact on the pupae per person index only. Ten papers provided enough detail for meta-analysis. Community mobilisation (four studies) was consistently effective, with an overall intervention effectiveness estimate of -0.10 (95%CI -0.20 - 0.00) for HI, -0.03 (95%CI -0.05 - -0.01) for CI, and -0.13 (95%CI -0.22 - -0.05) for BI. The single CRCT of biological control had effectiveness of -0.02 (95%CI -0.07- 0.03) for HI, -0.02 (95%CI -0.04- -0.01) for CI and -0.08 (95%CI -0.15- -0.01) for BI. The five studies of chemical control did not show a significant impact on indices: the overall effectiveness was -0.01 (95%CI -0.05- 0.03) for HI, 0.01 (95% CI -0.01- 0.02) for CI, and 0.01 (95%CI -0.03 - 0.05) for BI.Governments that rely on chemical control of Aedes aegypti should consider adding community mobilization to their prevention efforts. More well-conducted CRCTs of complex interventions, including those with biological control, are needed to provide evidence of real life impact. Trials of all interventions should measure impact on dengue risk.","['Dengue', 'biological control', 'chemical control', 'community mobilisation', 'metaanalysis']"
Genetic evaluation of early egg production and maturation traits using two different approaches in Japanese quail.,"The objective of the current study was to evaluate a multi-trait selection program based on aggregated breeding values using an animal model Best Linear Unbiased Prediction (BLUP) in Japanese quail. The estimated genetic gain was compared by both mixed model and least squares methods. Data of 1,682 female Japanese quails were collected through four consecutive generations to estimate genetic gain, depending on aggregated breeding values, for age at first egg (AFE), body weight at sexual maturity (BWSM), and days needed to produce the first ten eggs (DN10). Estimates of cumulative selection response were favorable for all the studied traits and significant for AFE (-3.03) and BWSM(10.38), but not significant for DN10(-0.15). Estimates of direct heritability were moderate for AFE (0.21) and BWSM(0.25) but low for DN10(0.08), while estimates of maternal heritability were moderate for AFE (0.19) but low for BWSM(0.04) and DN10(0.01). High (0.45 to 0.56) genetic and low (-0.01 to -0.18) phenotypic correlations were observed among the studied traits. Negative (-0.23 to -0.95) correlations between additive genetic and maternal genetic effects were observed for all traits. Genetic trends were -0.76 (P=0.031), 2.54 (P=0.037), and -0.06 (P=0.052) with calculated product-moment correlations between breeding values, estimated by BLUP and phenotypic selection methods, of 0.78 (P=0.002), 0.77 (P=0.004), and 0.61 (P=0.007) for AFE, BWSM, and DN10, respectively. Aggregated breeding value estimation based on animal model BLUP could be an effective method of constructing a selection program to achieve a favorable selection response in egg production traits in Japanese quail.","['BLUP', 'Japanese quail', 'egg production', 'genetic parameter', 'selection']"
Effects of remnant preservation in anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Compared with standard anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction, it is controversial whether anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) with remnant preservation can lead to better clinical outcomes. We conducted a systematic study and meta-analysis to assess the differences in clinical efficacy between the two.We searched for clinical randomized controlled studies and cohort studies included in the Cochrane library, PubMed, and Embase from March 2012 to March 2022 in English. The included studies were ACLR with or without remant preservation, and the data were extracted and the quality of the included studies was assessed by two authors, respectively. Revman 5.4 was used for statistical analysis and conclusions were presented.Ten articles containing a total of 777 patients were finally included. There was no significant difference in postoperative Lachman test [OR = 1.66, 95%CI (0.79, 3.49), <i>P</i> = 0.18 > 0.05], Tegner score [SMD = -0.13, 95%CI (-0.47, 0.22), <i>P</i> = 0.46 > 0.05], synovial coverage rate by second-look arthroscopy [OR = 1.55, 95%CI (0.66, 3.65), <i>P</i> = 0.32 > 0.05], the rate of cyclops lesion [OR = 3.92, 95%CI (0.53, 29.29), <i>P</i> = 0.18 > 0.05], joint range of motion [SMD = 0.27, 95%CI (-0.13, 0.68), <i>P</i> = 0.19 > 0.05] and re-injury rate [OR = 0.57, 95%CI (0.18, 1.74), <i>P</i> = 0.32 > 0.05] between the two groups. There were statistically significant differences in postoperative Lysholm score [SMD = 0.98, 95% CI (0.32, 1.64), <i>P</i> = 0.004 < 0.05], International Knee Documantation Committee grade (IKDC grade) [OR = 2.19, 95%CI (1.03, 4.65), <i>P</i> = 0.04 < 0.05], Pivot shift test [OR = 1.71, 95%CI (1.06, 2.77), <i>P</i> = 0.03 < 0.05], KT1000/2000 arthrometer side-to-side difference [SMD = -0.22, 95%CI (-0.42, -0.03), <i>P</i> = 0.02 < 0.05], operation time [SMD = 11.69, 95%CI (8.85, 14.54), <i>P</i> = 0.00001 < 0.05] and degree of tibial tunnel enlargement [SMD = -0.66, 95%CI (-1.08, -0.23), <i>P</i> = 0.002 < 0.05].This meta-analysis concluded that remnant preservation significantly had better results in terms of patient functional score (Lysholm, IKDC), knee stability (Pivot shift test, postoperative side-to-side anterior laxity) and tibial tunnel enlargement. In terms of complications (incidence of Cyclops lesions, range of motion, re-injury rate), no significant differences were seen between the two groups. Although many studies concluded that remnant preservation could bring better synovial coverage, this meta-analysis indicated that there is insufficient evidence to support it, possibly due to different remnant preservation procedures.The potential risks associated with longer operation times are also worth considering.","['anterior cruciate ligament', 'anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction', 'metaanalysis', 'remnant preservation', 'systematic review']"
Development and validation of machine learning models for predicting prognosis and guiding individualized postoperative chemotherapy: A real-world study of distal cholangiocarcinoma.,"Distal cholangiocarcinoma (dCCA), originating from the common bile duct, is greatly associated with a dismal prognosis. A series of different studies based on cancer classification have been developed, aimed to optimize therapy and predict and improve prognosis. In this study, we explored and compared several novel machine learning models that might lead to an improvement in prediction accuracy and treatment options for patients with dCCA.In this study, 169 patients with dCCA were recruited and randomly divided into the training cohort (n = 118) and the validation cohort (n = 51), and their medical records were reviewed, including survival outcomes, laboratory values, treatment strategies, pathological results, and demographic information. Variables identified as independently associated with the primary outcome by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, the random survival forest (RSF) algorithm, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were introduced to establish the following different machine learning models and canonical regression model: support vector machine (SVM), SurvivalTree, Coxboost, RSF, DeepSurv, and Cox proportional hazards (CoxPH). We measured and compared the performance of models using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, integrated Brier score (IBS), and concordance index (C-index) following cross-validation. The machine learning model with the best performance was screened out and compared with the TNM Classification using ROC, IBS, and C-index. Finally, patients were stratified based on the model with the best performance to assess whether they benefited from postoperative chemotherapy through the log-rank test.Among medical features, five variables, including tumor differentiation, T-stage, lymph node metastasis (LNM), albumin-to-fibrinogen ratio (AFR), and carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), were used to develop machine learning models. In the training cohort and the validation cohort, C-index achieved 0.763 <i>vs.</i> 0.686 (SVM), 0.749 <i>vs.</i> 0.692 (SurvivalTree), 0.747 <i>vs.</i> 0.690 (Coxboost), 0.745 <i>vs.</i> 0.690 (RSF), 0.746 <i>vs.</i> 0.711 (DeepSurv), and 0.724 <i>vs.</i> 0.701 (CoxPH), respectively. The DeepSurv model (0.823 <i>vs.</i> 0.754) had the highest mean area under the ROC curve (AUC) than other models, including SVM (0.819 <i>vs.</i> 0.736), SurvivalTree (0.814 <i>vs.</i> 0.737), Coxboost (0.816 <i>vs.</i> 0.734), RSF (0.813 <i>vs.</i> 0.730), and CoxPH (0.788 <i>vs.</i> 0.753). The IBS of the DeepSurv model (0.132 <i>vs.</i> 0.147) was lower than that of SurvivalTree (0.135 <i>vs.</i> 0.236), Coxboost (0.141 <i>vs.</i> 0.207), RSF (0.140 <i>vs.</i> 0.225), and CoxPH (0.145 <i>vs.</i> 0.196). Results of the calibration chart and decision curve analysis (DCA) also demonstrated that DeepSurv had a satisfactory predictive performance. In addition, the performance of the DeepSurv model was better than that of the TNM Classification in C-index, mean AUC, and IBS (0.746 <i>vs.</i> 0.598, 0.823 <i>vs.</i> 0.613, and 0.132 <i>vs.</i> 0.186, respectively) in the training cohort. Patients were stratified and divided into high- and low-risk groups based on the DeepSurv model. In the training cohort, patients in the high-risk group would not benefit from postoperative chemotherapy (p = 0.519). In the low-risk group, patients receiving postoperative chemotherapy might have a better prognosis (p = 0.035).In this study, the DeepSurv model was good at predicting prognosis and risk stratification to guide treatment options. AFR level might be a potential prognostic factor for dCCA. For the low-risk group in the DeepSurv model, patients might benefit from postoperative chemotherapy.","['AFR', 'DeepSurv', 'distal cholangiocarcinoma', 'individualized treatment', 'machine learning', 'postoperative chemotherapy', 'risk stratification']"
Selecting the correct exercise intensity for unbiased comparisons of thermoregulatory responses between groups of different mass and surface area.,"We assessed whether comparisons of thermoregulatory responses between groups unmatched for body mass and surface area (BSA) should be performed using a metabolic heat production (prod) in Watts or Watts per kilogram for changes in rectal temperature (ΔTre), and an evaporative heat balance requirement (Ereq) in Watts or Watts per square meter for local sweat rates (LSR). Two groups with vastly different mass and BSA [large (LG): 91.5 ± 6.8 kg, 2.12 ± 0.09 m(2), n = 8; small (SM): 67.6 ± 5.6 kg, 1.80 ± 0.09 m(2), n = 8; P < 0.001], but matched for heat acclimation status, sex, age, and with the same onset threshold esophageal temperatures (LG: +0.37 ± 0.12°C; SM: +0.41 ± 0.17°C; P = 0.364) and thermosensitivities (LG: 1.02 ± 0.54, SM: 1.00 ± 0.38 mg·cm(-2)·min(-1)·°C(-1); P = 0.918) for sweating, cycled for 60 min in 25°C at different levels of prod (500 W, 600 W, 6.5 W/kg, 9.0 W/kg) and Ereq (340 W, 400 W, 165 W/m(2), 190 W/m(2)). ΔTre was different between groups at a prod of 500 W (LG: 0.52 ± 0.15°C, SM: 0.92 ± 0.24°C; P < 0.001) and 600 W (LG: 0.78 ± 0.19°C, SM: 1.14 ± 0.24°C; P = 0.007), but similar at 6.5 W/kg (LG: 0.79 ± 0.21°C, SM: 0.85 ± 0.14°C; P = 0.433) and 9.0 W/kg (LG: 1.02 ± 0.22°C, SM: 1.14 ± 0.24°C; P = 0.303). Furthermore, ΔTre was the same at 9.0 W/kg in a 35°C environment (LG: 1.12 ± 0.30°C, SM: 1.14 ± 0.25°C) as at 25°C (P > 0.230). End-exercise LSR was different at Ereq of 400 W (LG: 0.41 ± 0.18, SM: 0.57 ± 0.13 mg·cm(-2)·min(-1); P = 0.043) with a trend toward higher LSR in SM at 340 W (LG: 0.28 ± 0.06, SM: 0.37 ± 0.15 mg·cm(-2)·min(-1); P = 0.057), but similar at 165 W/m(2) (LG: 0.28 ± 0.06, SM: 0.28 ± 0.12 mg·cm(-2)·min(-1); P = 0.988) and 190 W/m(2) (LG: 0.41 ± 0.18, SM: 0.37 ± 0.15 mg·cm(-2)·min(-1); P = 0.902). In conclusion, when comparing groups unmatched for mass and BSA, future experiments can avoid systematic differences in ΔTre and LSR by using a fixed prod in Watts per kilogram and Ereq in Watts per square meter, respectively.","['body mass', 'body surface area', 'core temperature', 'local sweat rate', 'thermoregulation']"
"Intracoronary injection of haematopoietic precursor cells regenerates the borders, but not the core, of old myocardial scars.","Cell therapy regenerative potential is hindered by cell access to the infarct zone. We studied function recovery at the scar zone and its impact in global left ventricular function after intracoronary injection of haematopoietic precursor cells.Haematopoietic precursor cells were obtained by blood apheresis in patients with an old myocardial infarction, and the presence of CD34+ and CD133+ cells was quantified. Left ventricular function, volumes, and infarct zone segmental motion were measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echo left ventricular segmental strain (LVSS). The aphaeresis product was administered to 20 patients in the coronary artery responsible for the myocardial infarction. High cell yield in blood aphaeresis product allowed us to inject a high number of cells in most patients. Three patients were excluded because of insufficient CD133+ cell number, and one more patient was excluded because of artefacts in MRI images. The remaining 16 patients were compared with 16 controls. After 1 year, infarct zone reduction was related to the number of CD133+ (R = 0.53; P %3C 0.05) and CD34+ (R = 0.63; P %3C 0.01) cells injected. The number of CD133+ cells injected was also related to an improvement in LVSS (R = 0.62; P %3C 0.01). In turn, scar zone reduction was related to an improvement in LVSS (R = 0.64; P %3C 0.01). End-diastolic volume showed a reduction at follow-up in the treated group when compared with control patients. MRI infarct area segments systolic thickness increase improved after treatment in treated patients [expressed as median (interquartile range)] [0.42 (-0.38 to 1.14) vs. 1.06 (-0.10 to 2.12) mm; P %3C 0.01], but not in controls [2.02 (0.75 to 3.4) vs. 1.91 (0.77-3.17) mm; P = not significant (n.s.)]. In cell therapy patients, the borders of the infarct zone, but not the core, showed a significant recovery [proximal rim: 0.48 (-0.18 to 1.33) vs. 1.07 (0.22-2.40) mm; P %3C 0.05, distal rim: 0.75 (0.26-1.40) vs. 1.76 (0.65-2.86) mm; P %3C 0.05, and core: 0.36 (-0.33 to 1.20) vs. 0.60 (-0.18 to 1.62) mm; P = n.s.]. That improvement was not observed in the control group [proximal rim: 1.20 (0.33-2.53) vs. 0.82 (-0.13 to 1.65) mm; P = n.s., distal rim: 1.24 (0.80-1.72) vs. 0.96 (0.19-1.81) mm; P = n.s., and core: 0.30 (-0.42 to 1.64) vs. 0.07 (-0.60 to 1.20) mm; P = n.s.]. Only small size infarcts showed a complete recovery in the cell therapy patients [systolic thickness increase post-treatment increment in infarcts ≤6 segments vs. >6 segments affected: 0.28 (-0.19 to 0.71) vs. -1.21 (-2.60 to -0.53) mm; P %3C 0.01].Intracoronary injection of peripheral blood-derived haematopoietic precursor cells produces a complete recovery of the borders and partial regeneration of the infarct core, which is directly related to the number of CD133+ and CD34+ cells injected. Cell therapy infarct zone regeneration prevents ventricular remodelling by preserving segmental contractility and halting left ventricular dilatation.","['Cellbased therapy', 'Heart regeneration', 'Heart repair', 'Myocardial infarction']"
The Beneficial Effects of Traditional Chinese Exercises for Adults with Low Back Pain: A Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"<i>Objective</i>: The aim of this meta-analytic review was to quantitatively examine the effects of traditional Chinese exercises (TCE) on pain intensity and back disability in individuals with low back pain (LBP). <i>Methods:</i> Potential articles were retrieved using seven electronic databases (Medline, Embase, Cinahl, Web of Science, Cochrane library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang). The searched period was from inception to 1 March 2019. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of TCE on pain intensity and back disability in LBP patients were included. Pooled effect sizes were calculated using the random-effects models and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). <i>Results:</i> Data from eleven RCTs (886 individuals with LBP) meeting the inclusion criteria were extracted for meta-analysis. Compared with the control intervention, TCE induced significant improvements in the visual analogue scale (VAS) (<i>Hedge's g</i> = -0.64, 95% CI -0.90 to -0.37, <i>p</i> < 0.001), Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ) (<i>Hedge's</i> g = -0.41, 95% CI -0.79 to -0.03, <i>p</i> = 0.03), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) (<i>Hedge's g</i> = -0.96, 95% CI -1.42 to -0.50, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and cognitive function (<i>Hedge's g</i> = -0.62, 95% CI -0.85 to -0.39, <i>p</i> < 0.001). In a meta-regression analysis, age (β = 0.01, <i>p</i> = 0.02) and total exercise time (β = -0.0002, <i>p</i> = 0.01) were associated with changes in the VAS scores, respectively. Moderator analyses demonstrated that Tai Chi practice (<i>Hedge's g</i> = -0.87, 95% CI -1.38 to -0.36, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and Qigong (<i>Hedge's g</i> = -0.54, 95% CI -0.86 to -0.23, <i>p</i> < 0.001) reduced VAS scores. Interventions with a frequency of 1-2 times/week (<i>Hedge's g</i> = -0.53, 95% CI -0.98 to -0.07, <i>p</i> = 0.02) and 3-4 times/week (<i>Hedge's g</i> = -0.78, 95% CI -1.15 to -0.42, <i>p</i> < 0.001) were associated with reduced VAS scores, but this significant reduction on this outcome was not observed in the weekly training frequency of ≥5 times (<i>Hedge's</i> g = -0.54, 95% CI -1.16 to 0.08, <i>p</i> = 0.09). <i>Conclusions:</i> TCE may have beneficial effects for reducing pain intensity for individuals with LBP, regardless of their pain status.","['Qigong', 'Tai Chi', 'disability', 'mindfulness', 'randomized controlled trial']"
Best-Fit Circle for the Replication of Humeral Head Anatomy in Total Shoulder Arthroplasty.,"Anatomic restoration of the humeral head is critical for successful shoulder replacement. Accurate measurements of the humeral head are essential for anatomic substitution.To evaluate whether a best-fit circle of the humeral head, as determined from different projections of plain radiographs, can predict the humeral head implant size for either the left or right shoulder.Descriptive laboratory study.Bilateral shoulder radiographs of 200 patients without arthropathy or other abnormal findings of the humeral head were evaluated. The best-fit circle was obtained based on 3 points: the medial and lateral endpoints of the anatomic neck and the lateral cortex below the greater tuberosity. This circle was drawn on 5 different radiographic projections (shoulder anteroposterior [AP], glenoid AP, outlet, axillary, and 30° caudal tilt) of the left and right shoulders of each patient, and the radius of each circle was measured. Agreement in the best-fit circle radius between the left and right shoulders was statistically analyzed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). There were 2 independent blinded observers who performed each measurement twice to evaluate inter- and intraobserver reliability.Overall agreement in the radius between the right and left shoulders was excellent (all ICCs ≥0.990). The ICCs according to the radiographic view were 0.990 (95% CI, 0.986-0.993) for shoulder AP, 0.992 (95% CI, 0.989-0.995) for glenoid AP, 0.996 (95% CI, 0.994-0.997) for outlet, 0.994 (95% CI, 0.991-0.996) for axillary, and 0.993 (95% CI, 0.990-0.995) for 30° caudal tilt. Interobserver ICCs demonstrated a high level of precision: 0.987 (95% CI, 0.978-0.993) for shoulder AP, 0.986 (95% CI, 0.974-0.992) for glenoid AP, 0.974 (95% CI, 0.954-0.985) for outlet, 0.991 (95% CI, 0.984-0.995) for axillary, and 0.987 (95% CI, 0.977-0.993) for 30° caudal tilt. Intraobserver ICCs demonstrated excellent test-retest reliability: 0.983 (95% CI, 0.970-0.991) for shoulder AP, 0.989 (95% CI, 0.980-0.994) for glenoid AP, 0.987 (95% CI, 0.978-0.993) for outlet, 0.985 (95% CI, 0.973-0.991) for axillary, and 0.970 (95% CI, 0.947-0.983) for 30° caudal tilt.The best-fit circle to calculate the ideal size of a humeral head implant was able to be determined from different projections of plain radiographs.Anatomic restoration of a deformed humeral head can be achieved using the best-fit circle of the contralateral humeral head as obtained from plain radiographs. This method can facilitate preoperative planning and postoperative evaluation in the anatomic restoration of the shoulder to avoid the problems of overstuffing.","['anatomic', 'arthroplasty', 'circle', 'humeral head', 'plain radiograph', 'shoulder']"
Effects of Carrying Police Equipment on Spatiotemporal and Kinetic Gait Parameters in First Year Police Officers.,"The main purpose of the study was to explore the effects of carrying police equipment on spatiotemporal and kinetic gait parameters. Two-hundred and seventy-five healthy men and women attending police academy (32% women) were randomly recruited. Gait analysis without and with a police equipment load (≈3.5 kg) was analyzed using the Zebris pressure platform. Differences and effect sizes were calculated using a Student <i>t</i>-test and Wilcoxon test for dependent samples and Cohen's D statistics. In both men and women, carrying police equipment significantly increased the foot rotation (effect size 0.13-0.25), step width (0.13-0.33), step time (0.25), stride time (0.13-0.25) and peak plantar pressure beneath the forefoot (0.16-0.30), midfoot (0.15-0.32) and hindfoot (0.13-0.25) region of the foot. Significant reductions in the step length (0.12-0.25), stride length (0.14-0.23), cadence (0.15-0.28) and walking speed (0.20-0.22) were observed in both sexes. Although significant, the effect sizes were mostly trivial in men and small in women. Our study shows significant changes in the spatiotemporal and kinetic gait parameters when carrying police equipment for both men and women. Although the effect sizes are trivial to small, carrying police equipment of ≈3.5 kg may have a negative impact on gait characteristics in first-year police officers.","['distribution', 'force', 'load', 'special population', 'walking']"
More secure attachment to the father and the mother is associated with fewer depressive symptoms in adolescents.,"To investigate whether more secure attachment to the father and the mother is associated with less depressive symptoms among adolescents, and to explore possible sex differences.A population-based sample of adolescents completed a school-based survey assessing demographic data, attachment to father and mother, as well as depressive symptoms. Participation rate was 80% of the eligible population, and 3,988 adolescents (1,937 boys and 2,051 girls) had complete data for the analyses.Paired samples t tests showed that participants rated their attachment to mothers as slightly more secure than their attachment to fathers (t = 15.94, P < 0.001; boys: t = 5.23, P < 0.001; girls: t = 16.16, P < 0.001). In linear regression analyses there was an association between the outcome, number of depressive symptoms, and more secure attachment to the mother for boys (B = -0.532; 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.656, -0.407, P < 0.001) and for girls (B = -0.623; 95% CI -0.730, -0.516, P < 0.001). Analogous results were found for more secure attachment to the father for boys (B = -0.499; 95% CI -0.608, -0.391, P < 0.001) and for girls (B = -0.494; 95% CI -0.586, -0.401, P < 0.001).Understanding the relationship between attachment to both father and mother and depressive symptoms in adolescent boys and girls is essential for further development of strategies for prevention and treatment of depression.","['Adolescents', 'attachment', 'depression', 'parents']"
Genetic parameters for daily milk somatic cell score and relationships with yield traits of primiparous Holstein cattle in Iran.,"Despite the importance of relationships between somatic cell score (SCS) and currently selected traits (milk, fat and protein yield) of Holstein cows, there was a lack of comprehensive literature for it in Iran. Therefore we tried to examine heritabilities and relationships between these traits using a fixed-regression animal model and Bayesian inference. The data set consisted of 1,078,966 test-day observations from 146,765 primiparous daughters of 1930 sires, with calvings from 2002 to 2013.Marginal posterior means of heritability estimates for SCS (0.03 ± 0.002) were distinctly lower than those for milk (0.204 ± 0.006), fat (0.096 ± 0.004) and protein (0.147 ± 0.005) yields. In the case of phenotypic correlations, the relationships between production and SCS were near zero at the beginning of lactation but become increasingly negative as days in milk increased. Although all environmental correlations between production and SCS were negative (-0.177 ± 0.007, -0.165 ± 0.008 and -0.152 ± 0.007 between SCS and milk, fat, and protein yield, respectively), slightly antagonistic genetic correlations were found; with posterior mean of relationships ranging from 0.01 ± 0.039 to 0.11 ± 0.036. This genetic opposition was distinctly higher for protein than for fat.Although small, the positive genetic correlations suggest some genetic antagonism between desired increased milk production and reduced SCS (i.e., single-trait selection for increased milk production will also increase SCS).","['Bayesian approach', 'Relationships', 'Somatic cell score', 'Yield traits']"
Effects of weight change on apolipoprotein B-containing emerging atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors.,"Non-high-density (HDL)-cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-particle number, apolipoprotein B, lipoprotein(a) (Lp(a)), and small-dense (sdLDL) and large-buoyant (lbLDL) LDL-subfractions are emerging apo B-containing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk factors. Current guidelines emphasize lifestyle, including weight loss, for ASCVD risk management. Whether weight change affects these emerging risk factors beyond that predicted by traditional triglyceride and LDL-cholesterol measurements remains to be determined.Regression analyses of fasting ∆apo B-containing lipoproteins vs. ∆BMI were examined in a large anonymized clinical laboratory database of 33,165 subjects who did not report use of lipid-lowering medications. Regression slopes (±SE) were estimated as: *∆mmol/L per ∆kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <sup>†</sup>∆g/L per ∆kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <sup>‡</sup>∆% per ∆kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and <sup>§</sup>∆μmol/L per ∆kg/m<sup>2</sup>.When adjusted for age, ∆BMI was significantly related to ∆nonHDL-cholesterol (males: 0.0238 ± 0.0041, P = 7.9 × 10<sup>- 9</sup>; females: 0.0330 ± 0.0037, P < 10<sup>- 16</sup>)*, ∆LDL-particles (males: 0.0128 ± 0.0024, P = 2.1 × 10<sup>- 7</sup>; females: 0.0114 ± 0.0022, P = 3.2 × 10<sup>- 7</sup>)<sup>*</sup>, ∆apo B (males: 0.0053 ± 0.0010, P = 7.9 × 10<sup>- 8</sup>; females: 0.0073 ± 0.0009, P = 2.2 × 10<sup>- 16</sup>)<sup>†</sup>, ∆sdLDL (males: 0.0125 ± 0.0015, P = 2.2 × 10<sup>- 16</sup>; females: 0.0128 ± 0.0012, P < 10<sup>- 16</sup>)*, ∆percent LDL carried on small dense particles (%sdLDL, males: 0.296 ± 0.035, P < 10<sup>- 16</sup>; females: 0.221 ± 0.023, P < 10<sup>- 16</sup>)<sup>‡</sup>, ∆triglycerides (males: 0.0358 ± 0.0049, P = 2.0 × 10<sup>- 13</sup>; females: 0.0304 ± 0.0029, P < 10<sup>- 16</sup>)*, and ∆LDL-cholesterol (males: 0.0128 ± 0.0034, P = 0.0002; females: 0.0232 ± 0.0031, P = 1.2 × 10<sup>- 13</sup>)* in both males and females. Age-adjusted ∆BMI was significantly related to ∆lbLDL in females (0.0098 ± 0.0024, P = 3.9 × 10<sup>- 5</sup>)* but not males (0.0007 ± 0.0026, P = 0.78)*. Female showed significantly greater increases in ∆LDL-cholesterol (P = 0.02) and ∆lbLDL (P = 0.008) per ∆BMI than males. ∆BMI had a greater effect on ∆LDL-cholesterol measured directly than indirect estimate of ∆LDL-cholesterol from the Friedewald equation. When sexes were combined and adjusted for age, sex, ∆triglycerides and ∆LDL-cholesterol, ∆BMI retained residual associations with ∆nonHDL-cholesterol (0.0019 ± 0.0009, P = 0.03)*, ∆LDL-particles (0.0032 ± 0.0010, P = 0.001)*, ∆apo B (0.0010 ± 0.0003, P = 0.0008)<sup>†</sup>, ∆Lp(a) (- 0.0091 ± 0.0021, P = 1.2 × 10<sup>- 5</sup>)<sup>§</sup>, ∆sdLDL (0.0001 ± 0.0000, P = 1.6 × 10<sup>- 11</sup>)<sup>*</sup> and ∆%sdLDL (0.151 ± 0.018, P < 10<sup>- 16</sup>) <sup>‡</sup>.Emerging apo B-containing risk factors show associations with weight change beyond those explained by the more traditional triglyceride and LDL-cholesterol measurements.","['Apolipoprotein B', 'lipoproteina', 'Cholesterol', 'Lowdensity lipoproteins', 'Obesity', 'Triglyceides', 'Weight loss']"
The effect of curcumin supplementation on functional strength outcomes and markers of exercise-induced muscle damage: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"<b>Background:</b> Curcumin is a polyphenol derived from the <i>Curcuma longa</i> L (turmeric) plant and has gained attention through its perceived anti-inflammatory characteristics. The potential interaction with exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS) has led to investigation of curcumin as a post-exercise strategy that may have the potential to lessen acute reductions in functional strength (FS) following physical activity. <b>Aim:</b> The purpose of this review is to assess the evidence examining curcumin in relation to four outcome measures: FS, EIMD, DOMS and inflammation. <b>Methods:</b> A Medline, SPORTDiscus and CINAHL database search was undertaken with no publication date limit. Sixteen papers met the inclusion criteria and were included in this review. Three meta-analyses were completed for EIMD, DOMS and inflammation, respectively, with FS being excluded due to limited research. <b>Results:</b> Effect sizes were as follows: EIMD (0.15, -0.12, -0.04, -0.2 and -0.61 corresponding to 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post-exercise, respectively), DOMS (-0.64, -0.33, 0.06, -0.53 and -1.16 corresponding to 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h post-exercise, respectively) and inflammation (-0.10, 0.26, 0.15 and 0.26 corresponding to 0, 24, 48 and 72 h post-exercise, respectively). A 96 h post-exercise inflammation meta-analysis was not conducted due to limited data. <b>Conclusion:</b> No effect sizes were statistically significant for EIMD (<i>p</i> = 0.644, 0.739, 0.893, 0.601 and 0.134), DOMS (<i>p</i> = 0.054, 0.092, 0.908, 0.119 and 0.074) and inflammation (<i>p</i> = 0.729, 0.603, 0.611 and 0.396). Further research is needed to thoroughly examine whether an effect exists.","['Turmeric', 'ergogenic aid', 'nutrition', 'physical activity', 'recovery', 'supplements']"
Genetic parameters of sow feed efficiency during lactation and its underlying traits in a Duroc population.,"As a result of the genetic selection for prolificacy and the improvements in the environment and farms management, litter size has increased in the last few years so that energy requirements of the lactating sow are greater. In addition, selection for feed efficiency of growing pigs is also conducted in maternal lines, and this has led to a decrease in appetite and feed intake that is extended to the lactation period, so the females are not able to obtain the necessary energy and nutrients for milk production and they mobilize their energetic reserves. When this mobilization is excessive, reproductive and health problems occur which ends up in an early sow culling. In this context, it has been suggested to improve feed efficiency at lactation through genetic selection. The aim of this study is to know, in a Duroc population, the genetic determinism of sow feed efficiency during lactation and traits involved in its definition, as well as genetic and environmental associations between them. The studied traits are daily lactation feed intake (dLFI), daily sow weight balance (dSWB), backfat thickness balance (BFTB), daily litter weight gain (dLWG), sow residual feed intake (RFI) and sow restricted residual feed intake (RRFI) during lactation. Data corresponded to 851 parities from 581 Duroc sows. A Bayesian analysis was performed using Gibbs sampling. A four-trait repeatability animal model was implemented including the systematic factors of batch and parity order, the standardized covariates of sow weight (SWf) and litter weight (LWs) at farrowing for all traits and lactation length for BFTB. The posterior mean (posterior SD) of heritabilities were: 0.09 (0.03) for dLFI, 0.37 (0.07) for dSWB, 0.09 (0.03) for BFTB, 0.22 (0.05) for dLWG, 0.04 (0.02) for RFI and null for RRFI. The genetic correlation between dLFI and dSWB was high and positive (0.74 (0.11)) and null between dLFI and BFTB. Genetic correlation was favourable between RFI and dLFI and BFTB (0.71 (0.16) and -0.69 (0.18)), respectively. The other genetic correlations were not statistically different from zero. The phenotypic correlations were low and positive between dLFI and dSWB (0.27 (0.03), dSWB and BFTB (0.25 (0.04)), and between dLFI and dLWG (0.16 (0.03)). Therefore, in the population under study, the improvement of the lactation feed efficiency would be possible either using RFI, which would not have unfavourable correlated effects, or through an index including its component traits.","['feed efficiency', 'genetic parameters', 'lactation', 'pig', 'selection']"
Housing and health outcomes: evidence on child morbidities from six Sub-Saharan African countries.,"The connection between healthy housing status and health is well established. The quality of housing plays a significant role in infectious and non-communicable as well as vector-borne diseases. The global burden of disease attributable to housing is considerable with millions of deaths arising from diarrheal and respiratory diseases annually. In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the quality of housing remains poor although improvements have been documented. There is a general dearth of comparative analysis across several countries in the sub-region. We assess in this study, the association between healthy housing and child morbidity across six countries in SSA.We use the Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data for six countries where the most recent survey collected health outcome data on child diarrhoea, acute respiratory illness, and fever. The total sample size of 91,096 is used in the analysis (representing 15, 044 for Burkina Faso, 11, 732 for Cameroon, 5, 884 for Ghana, 20, 964 for Kenya, 33, 924 for Nigeria, and 3,548 for South Africa). The key exposure variable is healthy housing status. We control for various factors associated with the three childhood health outcomes. These include quality housing status, residency (rural/urban), age of the head of the household, mother's education, mother's BMI status, marital status, mother's age, and religious status. Others include the child's gender, age, whether the child is from multiple or single births, and breastfeeding status. Inferential analysis using survey-weighted logistic regression is employed.Our findings indicate that housing is an important determinant of the three outcomes investigated. Compared to unhealthier housing, healthy housing status was found to be associated with reduced odds of diarrhoea in Cameroon [Healthiest: aOR = 0.48, 95% CI, (0.32,0.71), healthier: aOR = 0.50, 95% CI,(0.35,0.70), Healthy: aOR = 0.60, 95% CI, (0.44,0.83), Unhealthy: aOR = 0.60, 95% CI, (0.44,0.81)], Kenya [Healthiest: aOR = 0.68, 95% CI, (0.52,0.87), Healtheir: aOR = 0.79, 95% CI, (0.63,0.98), Healthy: aOR = 0.76, 95% CI, (0.62,0.91)], South Africa[Healthy: aOR = 0.41, 95% CI, (0.18, 0.97)], and Nigeria [Healthiest: aOR = 0.48, 95% CI,(0.37,0.62), Healthier: aOR = 0.61, 95% CI,(0.50,0.74), Healthy: aOR = 0.71, 95%CI, (0.59,0.86), Unhealthy: aOR = 0.78, 95% CI, (0.67,0.91)], and reduced odds of Acute Respiratory Infection in Cameroon [Healthy: aOR = 0.72, 95% CI,(0.54,0.96)], Kenya [Healthiest: aOR = 0.66, 95% CI, (0.54,0.81), Healthier: aOR = 0.81, 95% CI, (0.69,0.95)], and Nigeria [Healthiest: aOR = 0.69, 95% CI, (0.56,0.85), Healthier: aOR = 0.72, 95% CI, (0.60,0.87), Healthy: aOR = 0.78, 95% CI, (0.66,0.92), Unhealthy: aOR = 0.80, 95% CI, (0.69,0.93)] while it was associated with increased odds in Burkina Faso [Healthiest: aOR = 2.45, 95% CI, (1.39,4.34), Healthy: aOR = 1.55, 95% CI, (1.09,2.20)] and South Africa [Healthy: aOR = 2.36 95% CI, (1.31, 4.25)]. In addition, healthy housing was significantly associated with reduced odds of fever among children in all countries except South Africa [Healthiest: aOR = 2.09, 95% CI, (1.02, 4.29)] where children living in the healthiest homes had more than double the odds of having fever. In addition, household-level factors such as the age of the household head, and place of residence were associated with the outcomes. Child-level factors such as breastfeeding status, age, and sex, and maternal-level factors such as education, age, marital status, body mass index (BMI), and religion were also associated with the outcomes.The dissimilarity of findings across similar covariates and the multiple relations between healthy housing and under 5 morbidity patterns show unequivocally the heterogeneity that exists across African countries and the need to account for different contexts in efforts to seek an understanding of the role of healthy housing in child morbidity and general health outcomes.","['Acute respiratory illness', 'Africa', 'Diarrhoea', 'Housing', 'Morbidity']"
Genetic associations between autoimmune diseases and the risks of severe sepsis and 28-day mortality: a two-sample Mendelian randomization study.,"Autoimmune diseases exhibit heterogenous dysregulation of pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory cytokine expression, akin to the pathophysiology of sepsis. It is speculated that individuals with autoimmune diseases may have an increased likelihood of developing sepsis and face elevated mortality risks following septic events. However, current observational studies have not yielded consistent conclusions. This study aims to explore the causal relationship between autoimmune diseases and the risks of sepsis and mortality using Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis.We conducted a two-sample MR study involving a European population, with 30 autoimmune diseases as the exposure factors. To assess causal relationships, we employed the inverse variance-weighted (IVW) method and used Cochran's Q test for heterogeneity, as well as the MR pleiotropy residual sum and outlier (MR-PRESSO) global test for potential horizontal pleiotropy.Genetically predicted Crohn's disease (<i>β</i> = 0.067, se = 0.034, <i>p</i> = 0.046, OR = 1.069, 95% CI = 1.001-1.141) and idiopathic thrombocytopenic (<i>β</i> = 0.069, se = 0.031, <i>p</i> = 0.023, OR = 1.071, 95% CI = 1.009-1.136) were positively associated with an increased risk of sepsis in critical care. Conversely, rheumatoid arthritis (<i>β</i> = -0.104, se = 0.047, <i>p</i> = 0.025, OR = 0.901, 95% CI = 0.823-0.987), ulcerative colitis (<i>β</i> = -0.208, se = 0.084, <i>p</i> = 0.013, OR = 0.812, 95% CI = 0.690-0.957), and narcolepsy (<i>β</i> = -0.202, se = 0.092, <i>p</i> = 0.028, OR = 0.818, 95% CI = 0.684-0.978) were associated with a reduced risk of sepsis in critical care. Moreover, Crohn's disease (<i>β</i> = 0.234, se = 0.067, <i>p</i> = 0.001, OR = 1.263, 95% CI = 1.108-1.440) and idiopathic thrombocytopenic (<i>β</i> = 0.158, se = 0.061, <i>p</i> = 0.009, OR = 1.171, 95% CI = 1.041-1.317) were also linked to an increased risk of 28-day mortality of sepsis in critical care. In contrast, multiple sclerosis (<i>β</i> = -0.261, se = 0.112, <i>p</i> = 0.020, OR = 0.771, 95% CI = 0.619-0.960) and narcolepsy (<i>β</i> = -0.536, se = 0.184, <i>p</i> = 0.003, OR = 0.585, 95% CI = 0.408-0.838) were linked to a decreased risk of 28-day mortality of sepsis in critical care.This MR study identified causal associations between certain autoimmune diseases and risks of sepsis in critical care, and 28-day mortality in the European population. These findings suggest that exploring the mechanisms underlying autoimmune diseases may offer new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for sepsis prevention and treatment.","['28day mortality', 'Mendelian randomization', 'autoimmune diseases', 'risk factor', 'sepsis']"
Genetic parameters for haemoglobin levels in sows and piglets as well as sow reproductive performance and piglet survival.,"Genetic parameters were estimated for haemoglobin (Hb) levels in sows and piglets as well as sow reproductive performance and piglet survival. Reproductive traits were available between 2005 and 2014 for 7857 litters from 1029 Large White and 858 Landrace sows. In 2012 and 2013, Hb levels, sow BW and sow back fat depth were measured on 348 sows with 529 litters 5 days prior to farrowing. In addition, Hb levels were available for 1127 one-day-old piglets from 383 litters (a maximum of three piglets per litter) of 277 sows with Hb levels. The average Hb levels in sows (sow Hb), their litters (litter Hb, based on average Hb of three piglets) and individual piglets (piglet Hb) were 112 ± 12.6 g/l, 103 ± 15.3 g/l and 105 ± 21.7 g/l, respectively. Heritabilities for Hb levels were 0.09 ± 0.07 for sow Hb, 0.19 ± 0.11 for litter Hb and 0.08 ± 0.05 for piglet Hb. Estimates for the permanent environment effect of sows were 0.09 ± 0.09 for sow Hb, 0.11 ± 0.12 for litter Hb and 0.12 ± 0.03 for piglet Hb. In comparison, heritabilities for both number of stillborn piglets and pre-weaning survival were lower (0.05 ± 0.01 and 0.04 ± 0.01). Sow BW had no significant heritability, while sow back fat depth was lowly heritable (0.10 ± 0.08). Positive genetic correlations were found between sow Hb and litter Hb (0.64 ± 0.47) and between litter Hb and sow back fat depth (0.71 ± 0.53). Higher litter Hb was genetically associated with lower number of stillborn piglets (-0.78 ± 0.35) and higher pre-weaning survival (0.28 ± 0.33). Negative genetic correlations between sow Hb and average piglet birth weight of the litter (-0.60 ± 0.34) and between piglet Hb and birth weight of individual piglets (-0.37 ± 0.32) indicate that selection for heavier piglets may reduce Hb levels in sows and piglets. Similarly, selection for larger litter size will reduce average piglet birth weight (rg: -0.40 ± 0.12) and pre-weaning survival (-0.57 ± 0.13) and may lead to lower litter Hb (-0.48 ± 0.27). This study shows promising first results for the use of Hb levels as a selection criterion in pig breeding programs, and selection for higher Hb levels may improve piglet survival and limit further reduction in Hb levels in sows and piglets due to selection for larger and heavier litters.","['Anaemia', 'haemoglobin', 'preweaning survival', 'sow characteristics', 'stillborn piglets']"
"What is the Effect of Changing Running Step Rate on Injury, Performance and Biomechanics? A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.","Running-related injuries are prevalent among distance runners. Changing step rate is a commonly used running retraining strategy in the management and prevention of running-related injuries.The aims of this review were to synthesise the evidence relating to the effects of changing running step rate on injury, performance and biomechanics.Systematic review and meta-analysis.MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and SPORTDiscus.Thirty-seven studies were included that related to injury (n = 2), performance (n = 5), and biomechanics (n = 36). Regarding injury, very limited evidence indicated that increasing running step rate is associated with improvements in pain (4 weeks: standard mean difference (SMD), 95% CI 2.68, 1.52 to 3.83; 12 weeks: 3.62, 2.24 to 4.99) and function (4 weeks: 2.31, 3.39 to 1.24); 12 weeks: 3.42, 4.75 to 2.09) in recreational runners with patellofemoral pain. Regarding performance, very limited evidence indicated that increasing step rate increases perceived exertion ( - 0.49,  - 0.91 to - 0.07) and awkwardness (- 0.72, - 1.38 to - 0.06) and effort (- 0.69, - 1.34, - 0.03); and very limited evidence that an increase in preferred step rate is associated with increased metabolic energy consumption (- 0.84, - 1.57 to - 0.11). Regarding biomechanics, increasing running step rate was associated with strong evidence of reduced peak knee flexion angle (0.66, 0.40 to 0.92); moderate evidence of reduced step length (0.93, 0.49 to 1.37), peak hip adduction (0.40, 0.11 to 0.69), and peak knee extensor moment (0.50, 0.18 to 0.81); moderate evidence of reduced foot strike angle (0.62, 034 to 0.90); limited evidence of reduced braking impulse (0.64, 0.29 to 1.00), peak hip flexion (0.42, 0.10 to 0.75), and peak patellofemoral joint stress (0.56, 0.07 to 1.05); and limited evidence of reduced negative hip (0.55, 0.20 to 0.91) and knee work (0.84, 0.48 to 1.20). Decreasing running step rate was associated with moderate evidence of increased step length (- 0.76, - 1.31 to - 0.21); limited evidence of increased contact time (- 0.95, - 1.49 to - 0.40), braking impulse (- 0.73, - 1.08 to - 0.37), and negative knee work (- 0.88, - 1.25 to - 0.52); and limited evidence of reduced negative ankle work (0.38, 0.03 to 0.73) and negative hip work (0.49, 0.07 to 0.91).In general, increasing running step rate results in a reduction (or no change), and reducing step rate results in an increase (or no change), to kinetic, kinematic, and loading rate variables at the ankle, knee and hip. At present there is insufficient evidence to conclusively determine the effects of altering running step rate on injury and performance. As most studies included in this review investigated the immediate effects of changing running step rate, the longer-term effects remain largely unknown.CRD42020167657.","['Biomechanics', 'Cadence', 'Gait retraining', 'Metaanalysis', 'Performance', 'Running retraining', 'Runningrelated injury', 'Step rate', 'Systematic review']"
Evaluation of Four Methods for the Assessment of Sarcopenia in Older Adults in Nursing Homes.,"We aimed to evaluate the comparative effectiveness and applicability of using calf circumference (CC), strength, need for assistance with walking, rising from a sitting position, climbing stairs, and the incidence of falls (SARC-F), as well as SARC-F plus CC (SARC-CalF) and the Ishii test, for assessing sarcopenia in older adult nursing home occupants.In this cross-sectional study, the diagnostic criteria of the AWGS2019 were used as the standard, and the accuracy of the four screening methods determined by indicators, including sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, positive predictive values (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV).One hundred and ninety-nine older adults, 97 male and 102 female, were included. The prevalence of sarcopenia was 48.7%. Over all the participants, the sensitivity and specificity of CC were 74.22% and 51.96%, respectively, and 40.21% and 83.33%, respectively, for SARC-F. The use of SARC-CalF raised the SARC-F sensitivity (71.14%) while reducing the specificity (60.78%). The Ishii test had a sensitivity of 89.7% and a specificity of 74.51%. The PPV and NPV of CC, SARC-F, SARC-CalF, Ishii test were 0.6/0.68, 0.7/0.59, 0.55/0.63, and 0.77/0.88, respectively. The areas under the curve for CC, SARC-F, SARC-CalF, and the Ishii test were 0.67(95%CI, 0.59-0.74), 0.71(95%CI, 0.64-0.79), 0.71(95%CI, 0.64-0.79), and 0.86 (95% CI,0.81-0.92), respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of CC, SARC-F, SARC-CalF, and the Ishii test for sarcopenia screening in males were 71.69%/56.41%, 29.31%/79.49%, 67.24%/64.10%, and 94.83%/56.41%, respectively, and in females were 79.49%/49.21%, 56.41%/85.71%, 76.92%/58.73%, and 82.05%/85.71%, respectively. The PPV and NPV of CC, SARC-F, SARC-CalF, and the Ishii test in males were 0.71/0.56, 0.68/0.43, 0.74/0.57, and 0.76/0.88, respectively, while in females the values were 0.49/0.79, 0.71/0.76, 0.54/0.8, and 0.78/0.89, respectively.The areas under the curve for CC, SARC-F, SARC-CalF, and the Ishii test in males were 0.7(95%CI, 0.59-0.8), 0.63(95%CI, 0.52-0.75), 0.68(95%CI, 0.57-0.8), and 0.86(95% CI, 0.78-0.94), respectively, and in females 0.69(95%CI, 0.58-0.8), 0.81(95%CI, 0.72-0.89), 0.76(95%CI, 0.67-0.86), and 0.85 (95%CI, 0.77-0.94), respectively.The overall screening ability of the Ishii test for sarcopenia was superior to that of the CC, SARC-F, and SARC-CalF in older adults in nursing homes.","['Older adults', 'nursing home', 'sarcopenia', 'screening']"
"Adult use cannabis legalization and cannabis use disorder treatment in California, 2010-2021.","Many nations and jurisdictions have legalized non-medical adult use of cannabis, or are considering doing so. This paper contributes to knowledge of adult use legalization's associations with cannabis use disorder (CUD) treatment utilization.This study collected data from a dataset of all publicly funded substance use disorder treatment delivered in California from 2010 to 2021 (1,460,066 episodes). A logistic regression model estimates adult use legalization's impacts on CUD treatment utilization using an individual-level pre-post time series model, including individual and county-level characteristics and county and year-fixed effects.Adult use legalization was associated with a significant decrease in the probability of admission to CUD treatment (average marginal effect (AME): -0.005, 95 % CI: -0.009, 0.000). Adult use legalization was also associated with a decrease in the probability of admission to CUD treatment for males (AME: -0.025, 95 % CI: -0.027, -0.023) Medi-Cal beneficiaries (AME: -0.025, 95 % CI: -0.027, -0.023) adults ages 21+ (AME: -0.011, 95 % CI: -0.014, -0.009) and Whites (AME: -0.012, 95 % CI: -0.015, -0.010), and an increase in the probability of admission to CUD treatment for patients referred from the criminal justice system (AME: 0.017, 95 % CI: 0.015, 0.020) and Blacks (AME: 0.004, 95 % CI: 0.000, 0.007) and Hispanics (AME: 0.009, 95 % CI: 0.006, 0.011).Adult use legalization is associated with declining CUD treatment admissions, even though cannabis-related problems are becoming more prevalent. Policies and practices that protect public health, and engage people with CUD in treatment are needed.","['Adult use legalization', 'Cannabis', 'Cannabis use disorder treatment', 'Substance use disorder treatment']"
Comparison of Intraocular Pressure and Anterior Chamber Angle Changes between Pilocarpine and Laser Peripheral Iridotomy.,"To compare intraocular pressure and anterior chamber angle changes between pilocarpine and laser peripheral iridotomy in primary angle closure.In this clinical trial study, 34 eyes of 29 patients with primary angle-closure were prospectively enrolled between November 2015 and February 2016. Intraocular pressure and anterior segment optical coherence tomography were performed at three separate times: on the initial conditions, 3-5 days of administration of topical pilocarpine 2%, and 1 week after laser iridotomy. Anterior chamber angle parameters were the angle opening distance (AOD) and trabecular-iris space area (TISA).The intraocular pressure reduction following pilocarpine administration was significant compared to laser iridotomy: 3.9 mm Hg (-32.5 to 0.20) vs 1.8 mm Hg (-33.5 to 2.30) (<i>p</i> = 0.002). Meanwhile, the increment of angle parameters following laser iridotomy was significant compared to pilocarpine. The AOD750 increment of both nasal and temporal quadrant following laser iridotomy was significant compared to pilocarpine: 0.13 mm (-0.27 to 0.28) vs 0.05 mm (-0.35 to 0.29) (<i>p</i> = 0.003) and 0.12 mm (-0.10 to 0.34) vs 0.04 mm (-0.27 to 0.19) (<i>p</i> = 0.002), respectively. The TISA750 increment of both nasal and temporal quadrant following laser iridotomy was also significant compared to pilocarpine: 0.05 mm<sup>2</sup> (-0.06 to 0.20) vs 0.02 mm<sup>2</sup> (-0.12 to 0.13) (<i>p</i> = 0.023) and 0.04 mm<sup>2</sup> (-0.04 to 0.17) vs 0.01 mm<sup>2</sup> (-0.14 to 0.18) (<i>p</i> = 0.012), respectively.Laser peripheral iridotomy widens the angle greater than topical pilocarpine, but topical pilocarpine lowers the intraocular pressure greater than laser iridotomy. These data suggest that pilocarpine has another mechanism to decrease the intraocular pressure in primary angle-closure, besides widening the angle.Yunard A, Oktariana VD, <i>et al.</i> Comparison of Intraocular Pressure and Anterior Chamber Angle Changes between Pilocarpine and Laser Peripheral Iridotomy.

"Prognostic values of SOFA score, qSOFA score, and LODS score for patients with sepsis.","Sepsis continues to carry a high rate of mortality, which makes effective and simple evaluation methods for predicting the prognosis of septic patients especially important. In this study, we retrospectively analyzed the relationships between three scoring systems including Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Quick SOFA (qSOFA) score, and Logistic Organ Dysfunction System (LODS) score and the prognoses of septic patients.The baseline data, SOFA score, qSOFA score, LODS score, 28-day prognosis, and 90-day prognosis of patients who met the diagnostic criteria of sepsis were retrieved from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III (MIMIC-III) database. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were drawn for various indicators, and comparisons were drawn between the areas under the ROC curves (AUC) of the different scoring systems.The 28-day AUC was 0.661 (0.652, 0.670) for SOFA, 0.558 (0.548, 0.568) for qSOFA, and 0.668 (0.658, 0.677) for LODS; AUC-qSOFA vs. AUC-LODS was 0.103 (0.087, 0.120) (P<0.001), and AUC-qSOFA vs. AUC-LODS was 0.110 (0.094, 0.125) (P<0.001). The 90-day AUC was 0.630 (0.621, 0.640) for SOFA, 0.551 (0.541, 0.560) for qSOFA, and 0.644 (0.635, 0.653) for LODS; AUC-SOFA vs. AUC-qSOFA was 0.079 (0.065, 0.094) (P<0.001), and AUC-qSOFA vs. AUC-LODS was 0.093 (0.079, 0.107) (P<0.001).SOFA score, qSOFA score, and LODS score can all be used to predict the prognosis of septic patients. LODS score and SOFA score have higher accuracy than qSOFA score; however, qSOFA is simpler to use, making it a more suitable tool in an emergency setting.","['Logistic Organ Dysfunction System score LODS score', 'Quick SOFA score qSOFA score', 'Sepsis', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score SOFA score', 'prognosis']"
Low blood carotenoid status in dementia and mild cognitive impairment: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Given their potent antioxidation properties, carotenoids play a role in delaying and preventing dementia and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). However, observational studies have found inconsistent results regarding the associations between blood carotenoid levels and the risk of dementia and MCI. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the relationship between blood carotenoid levels and the risk of dementia and MCI.A systematic search was performed in the Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library electronic databases to retrieve relevant English articles published from their inception until February 23, 2023. Study quality was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled using random-effect meta-analyses. Ultimately, 23 studies (n = 6610) involving 1422 patients with dementia, 435 patients with MCI, and 4753 controls were included.Our meta-analysis showed that patients with dementia had lower blood lycopene (SMD: -0.521; 95%CI: -0.741, -0.301), α-carotene (SMD: -0.489; 95%CI: -0.697, -0.281), β-carotene (SMD: -0.476; 95%CI: -0.784, -0.168), lutein (SMD: -0.516; 95%CI: -0.753, -0.279), zeaxanthin (SMD: -0.571; 95%CI: -0.910, -0.232) and β-cryptoxanthin (SMD: -0.617; 95%CI: -0.953, -0.281) than the controls. Our results indicated that blood carotenoid levels were significantly lower in patients with dementia than in controls, despite high heterogeneity across the studies. Owing to insufficient data, we did not observe a similar and stable relationship between blood carotenoid levels and MCI.Our meta-analysis indicated that lower blood carotenoid levels may be a risk factor for dementia and MCI.","['Blood carotenoid levels', 'Dementia', 'Metaanalysis', 'Mild cognitive impairment', 'Systematic review']"
Exposure to Heavy Metals and Serum Adiponectin Levels among Workers: A 2-Year Follow-Up Study.,"The workers exposed to metal fumes had an increased risk of metabolic syndrome, which was correlated with decreased serum adiponectin. Thus, we aimed to explore whether heavy metal exposure affects the adiponectin level. There were 96 male workers recruited from a shipyard at baseline. Apart from 82 participants completed the follow-up assessments, new participants were recruited in next year. Finally, there were 100 welding workers in the exposure group and 31 office workers in the control group. Inferential statistics on repeated measures were performed using generalized estimating equations. A weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression model was conducted to examine the joint effect of the multimetal exposure with serum adiponectin. Significantly negative associations of metals with adiponectin were detected in the welding workers, including Cr (β = -0.088; 95% CI: -0.148, -0.027), Mn (β = -0.174; 95% CI: -0.267, -0.081), Co (β = -0.094; 95% CI: -0.158, -0.029), Ni (β = -0.108; 95% CI: -0.208, -0.008), Cd (β = -0.067; 95% CI: -0.115, -0.018), and Pb (β = -0.089; 95% CI: -0.163, -0.015). The WQS regression suggested that Pb was the greatest contributor. In conclusion, our findings highlighted that welding workers exposed to heavy metals would reduce serum adiponectin.","['heavy metals', 'lipid peroxidation', 'metabolic syndrome', 'serum adiponectin']"
Distancing Adherence and Negative Emotions among the Israeli Elderly Population during the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Social distancing was found to prevent COVID-19 contagion. Therefore, understanding the factors associated with the public's adherence is important. Acknowledging the importance of emotional wellbeing regarding older people's health, and understanding their emotional state during the pandemic, are crucial. This study assessed factors associated with older people's adherence to social distancing and their emotional status. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted among 1822 respondents above the age of 60. Distancing adherence, negative emotion, trust, social support, threat perception, attitudes, and subjective norms were assessed, and a path analysis was performed. Adherence was positively associated with attitudes (β = 0.10; <i>p</i> < 0.001), and with subjective norms (β = 0.19; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Negative emotions were positively associated with threat perception (β = 0.33; <i>p</i> < 0.001), and negatively associated with social support (β = -0.13; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and subjective norms (β = -0.10; <i>p</i> < 0.001). Attitudes mediated the relationship of threat perception (95% CI = 0.009, 0.034), trust (95% CI = 0.008, 0.029), and social support (95% CI = 0.006, 0.023) with distancing adherence. Subjective norms mediated the relationship between threat perception (95% CI = 0.014, 0.034), trust (95% CI = 0.026, 0.055), and social support (95% CI = 0.002, 0.048) with distancing adherence. Subjective norms mediated the relationship between threat perception (95% CI = -0.022, -0.006), trust (95% CI = -0.034, -0.010), and social support (95% CI = -0.029, -0.009) with negative emotions. When promoting social distancing adherence, subjective norms and attitudes must be considered, as they play a role in promoting adherence and negative-emotion regulation.","['COVID19', 'distancing adherence', 'negative emotion', 'older people', 'social support', 'trust in healthcare system']"
Efficacy of Tai Chi on lower limb function of Parkinson's disease patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"At present, the effect of Tai Chi (TC) on lower limb function in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is controversial. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis on the influence of TC on lower limb function in PD patients.According to the PRISMA guidelines, seven databases were searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTS) were selected and screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. We assessed the quality of the studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and then extracted the characteristics of the included studies. The random effect model was adopted, and heterogeneity was measured by <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> statistic.A total of 441 articles were screened, and 10 high-quality RCTs were with a total of 532 patients with PD met Our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that compared To control groups TC improved several outcomes. TC significantly improved motor function (SMD = -0.70; 95% CI = -0.95, -0.45; <i>p</i> < 0.001; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 35%), although The results were not statistically significant for The subgroup analysis of TC duration (SMD = -0.70; 95% CI = -0.95, -0.45; <i>p</i> = 0.88; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%;). TC significantly improved balance function (SMD = 0.89; 95% CI = 0.51, 1.27; <i>p</i> < 0.001; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 54%), functional walking capacity (SMD = -1.24; 95% CI = -2.40, -0.09; <i>p</i> = 0.04; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 95%), and gait velocity (SMD = 0.48; 95% CI = -0.02, 0.94; <i>p</i> = 0.04; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 78%), But Did Not improve endurance (SMD = 0.31; 95% CI = -0.12, 0.75; <i>p</i> = 0.16; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%), step length (SMD = 0.01; 95% CI = -0.34, 0.37; <i>p</i> = 0.94; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 29%), and cadence (SMD = 0.06; 95% CI = -0.25, 0.36; <i>p</i> = 0.70; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%).TC has beneficial effects on motor function, balance function, functional walking ability, and gait velocity, but does not improve walking endurance, stride length, and cadence.","['Parkinson’s disease', 'Tai Chi', 'balance', 'gait', 'motor function']"
Prognostic factors in traumatic brain injuries in emergency department.,"Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in young adults. The Extended Glasgow Outcome Score (GOSE) has been introduced to assess the global outcome after brain injuries. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the prognostic factors associated with GOSE.This was a multicenter cross-sectional study conducted on 144 patients with TBI admitted at trauma emergency centers. The patients' information, including demographic characteristics, duration of hospital stay, mechanical ventilation and on-admission laboratory measurements, and on-admission vital signs, were evaluated. The patients' TBI-related symptoms and brain computed tomography (CT) scan findings were recorded.GOSE assessments showed an increasing trend by the comparison of on-discharge (7.47 ± 1.30), within a month (7.51 ± 1.30) and within 3 months (7.58 ± 1.21) evaluations (<i>P</i> < 0.001). On-discharge GOSE was positively correlated with Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS)(<i>r</i> = 0.729, <i>P</i> < 0.001), motor GCS (<i>r</i> = 0.812, <i>P</i> < 0.001), Hb (<i>r</i> = 0.165, <i>P</i> = 0.048), and pH (<i>r</i> = 0.165, <i>P</i> = 0.048) and inversely with age (<i>r</i> = -0.261, <i>P</i> = 0.002), hospitalization period (<i>r</i> = -0.678, <i>P</i> < 0.001), pulse rate (<i>r</i> = -0.256, <i>P</i> = 0.002), white blood cell (WBC) (<i>r</i> = -0.222, <i>P</i> = 0.008), and triglyceride (<i>r</i> = -0.218, <i>P</i> = 0.009). In multiple linear regression analysis, the associations were significant only for GCS (<i>B</i> = 0.102, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0-0.202; <i>P</i> = 0.05), hospitalization stay duration (<i>B</i> = -0.004, 95% CI: -0.005--0.003, <i>P</i> = 0.001), and WBC (<i>B</i> = 0.00001, 95% CI: 0.00000014-0.000025; <i>P</i> = 0.024). Among imaging signs and trauma-related symptoms in univariate analysis, intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), interventricular hemorrhage (IVH) (<i>P</i> = 0.006), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) (<i>P</i> = 0.06; marginally at <i>P</i> < 0.1), subdural hemorrhage (SDH) (<i>P</i> = 0.032), and epidural hemorrhage (EDH) (<i>P</i> = 0.037) was significantly associated with GOSE at discharge in multivariable analysis.According to the current study findings, GCS, hospitalization stay duration, WBC and among imaging signs and trauma-related symptoms ICH, IVH, SAH, SDH, and EDH are independent significant predictors of GOSE at discharge in TBI patients.","['Computed tomography', 'Glasgow Coma Scale', 'Glasgow Outcome Scale', 'Xray', 'traumatic brain injuries']"
Effects of Lifestyle Modification and Anti-diabetic Medicine on Prediabetes Progress: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"<b>Background:</b> Pre-diabetes is a risk factor for full-blown diabetes; it presents opportunities to prevent the actual diseases. It is therefore essential to identify effective preventive strategies, and to clarify the direction of future research. <b>Methods:</b> PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched using key terms (Supplementary Table 1). We applied network meta-analysis to multiple comparisons among various diabetic preventive strategies, including lifestyle and pharmacological interventions; traditional meta-analysis for the synthesis of basal metabolic changes after interventions; and trial sequential analysis for determinations as to whether analysis conclusions meet expectations. <b>Results:</b> We included 32 randomized controlled trials comprising 43,669 patients and 14 interventions in the meta-analysis. Both lifestyle modifications and anti-diabetic medications improved physical conditions, including weight loss, blood glucose, and blood pressure. Network meta-analysis suggested that the progression of diabetes could be delayed to varying degrees by lifestyle and pharmacological interventions, except for angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins, sulfonylureas and vitamin D. The risk ratios (RR) [95% credible interval (CrI)] compared with control were: GLP-1RAs 0.28 (0.15, 0.50), Orlistat 0.33 (0.18, 0.55), TZM 0.33 (0.16, 0.63), TZD 0.39 (0.27, 0.53), LST 0.54 (0.32, 0.88), lifestyle 0.58 (0.49, 0.67), LSM 0.62 (0.45, 0.80), GI 0.66 (0.46, 0.88), SU 0.67 (0.40, 1.00), Vitamin D 0.91 (0.59, 1.40), ACEI 0.93 (0.62, 1.40), statins 1.20 (0.84, 1.60). <b>Conclusions:</b> In adults with pre-diabetes, firm evidence supports the notion that lifestyle modifications and metformin reduces the incidence of diabetes with an average of 20% relative risk reduction, while statins increase the relative risk 20%. We found that lifestyle modifications, promising long-term strategies involving three factors (nutrition, exercise, and weight loss) contribute to health by reducing BMI, body weight, waist and hip circumference, systolic and diastolic pressure, fasting, and 2-h postprandial blood glucose, total cholesterol and by increasing HDL. We made this determination using TSA, avoiding further waste of experimental resources.","['diabetes mellitus', 'drug therapy', 'healthy lifestyle', 'network metaanalysis', 'prediabetic state', 'randomized controlled trial', 'trial sequential analysis', 'type 2']"
Effects of atropine 0.01% on refractive errors in children with myopia.,"Little is known about changes in astigmatism during atropine treatment. We aimed to explore the effects of atropine 0.01% eye drops on both spherical and cylindrical refractive errors in myopic children.Children aged 6-14 years with myopia ≥ -6.00 D and < -0.50 D, and total astigmatism > -2.00 D in at least one eye were enrolled. Subjects were randomised either to receive atropine 0.01% once nightly with single-vision lenses or simply to wear single-vision lenses and were followed up at 3-month intervals. Cycloplegic refraction and axial length were measured. The magnitude and direction of total astigmatism (TA), corneal astigmatism (CA), and residual astigmatism (RA) were evaluated.Overall, 119 eyes (69 eyes in the atropine group and 50 eyes in the control group) were included in the final analyses after 9 months. Atropine-treated eyes showed significantly less progression of myopia than did control eyes (spherical equivalent: -0.35 ± 0.33 vs. -0.56 ± 0.49 D, p = 0.001; axial length: 0.20 ± 0.19 vs. 0.33 ± 0.19 mm, p < 0.001). Compared with control eyes (-0.04 ± 0.23 D), a significant increase in TA was observed in the atropine-treated eyes (-0.14 ± 0.29 D); this was mainly attributed to the increase in CA (-0.17 ± 0.26 D) rather than the minor decrease in RA (0.02 ± 0.32 D).Atropine 0.01% was effective in preventing myopia progression, whereas 9 months of atropine treatment resulted in a clinically small, but statistically significant increase in TA in myopic Chinese children.","['Astigmatism', 'Atropine', 'Myopia', 'Refractive error']"
ERBB2 as a prognostic biomarker correlates with immune infiltrates in papillary thyroid cancer.,"Epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (<i>ERBB2</i>) is commonly over-expressed in advanced or metastatic tissues of papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) with poor prognosis, while it remains unknown whether <i>ERBB2</i> plays a role in the progression of PTC. Thus, we analyzed the data derived from online repositories, including TCGA, KEGG, GO, GeneMANIA, and STRING, to explore the relationship between <i>ERBB2</i> expression and prognosis, tumor phenotypes of interest, and immune infiltrates in PTC. Compared to normal thyroid tissue, <i>ERBB2</i> was up-regulated in PTC samples (<i>p</i> < 0.001); In comparison with the group with low expression of <i>ERBB2</i>, the group with high expression of <i>ERBB2</i> had poorer progression-free interval in stage III/IV patients (<i>p</i> = 0.008) and patients aged >45 years (<i>p</i> = 0.019). The up-regulated <i>ERBB2</i> was associated with iodine metabolism dysfunction, proliferation, metastasis, angiogenesis, and drug resistance. The expression of <i>ERBB2</i> negatively correlated with enrichment scores of B cells (r = -0.176, <i>p</i> < 0.001), CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (r = -0.160, <i>p</i> < 0.001), cytotoxic cells (r = -0.219, <i>p</i> < 0.001), NK CD56dim cells (r = -0.218, <i>p</i> < 0.001), plasmacytoid dendritic cells (r = -0.267, <i>p</i> < 0.001), T cells (r = -0.164, <i>p</i> < 0.001), T follicular helper cells (r = -0.111, <i>p =</i> 0.012), gamma delta T cells (r = -0.105, <i>p =</i> 0.017), and regulatory T cells (r = -0.125, <i>p</i> = 0.005). In conclusion, <i>ERBB2</i> may serve as a prognostic biomarker and an immunotherapeutic target in PTC, deserving further exploration.","['ERBB2', 'biomarker', 'immune microenviroment', 'papillary thyroid cancer', 'prognosis']"
Extended calorie restriction suppresses overall and specific food cravings: a systematic review and a meta-analysis.,"Multiple studies have concluded that calorie restriction for at least 12 weeks is associated with reduced food cravings, while others have shown that calorie restriction may increase food cravings. We addressed this ambiguity in a systematic review and meta-analysis.We searched for studies conducted on subjects with obesity, implemented calorie restriction for at least 12 weeks and measured food cravings pre-intervention and post-intervention. Our final eight studies mostly used the Food Craving Inventory. Other comparable methods were converted to a similar scale. We used the duration ≥12 weeks, but closest to 16 weeks for studies with multiple follow-ups and performed DerSimonian-Laird random-effects meta-analyses using the 'metafor' package in r software.Despite heterogeneity across studies, we observed reductions in pooled effects for overall food cravings (-0.246 [-0.490, -0.001]) as well as cravings for sweet (-0.410 [-0.626, -0.194]), high-fat (-0.190 [-0.343, -0.037]), starchy (-0.288 [-0.517, -0.058]) and fast food (-0.340 [-0.633, -0.048]) in the meta-analysis. Baseline body weight, type of intervention, duration, sample size and percentage of female subjects explained the heterogeneity.Calorie restriction is associated with reduced food cravings supporting a de-conditioning model of craving reductions. Our findings should ease the minds of clinicians concerned about increased cravings in patients undergoing calorie restriction interventions.","['Calorie restriction', 'food craving inventory', 'food cravings', 'weight loss']"
"A Study of Thyroid Fine Needle Aspiration of Follicular Adenoma in the ""Atypia of Undetermined Significance"" Bethesda Category Using Digital Image Analysis.","Originally designed for computerized image analysis, ThinPrep is underutilized in that role outside gynecological cytology. It can be used to address the inter/intra-observer variability in the evaluation of thyroid fine needle aspiration (TFNA) biopsy and help pathologists to gain additional insight into thyroid cytomorphology.We designed and validated a feature engineering and supervised machine learning-based digital image analysis method using ImageJ and Python scikit-learn . The method was trained and validated from 400 low power (100x) and 400 high power (400x) images generated from 40 TFNA cases.The area under the curve (AUC) for receiver operating characteristics (ROC) is 0.75 (0.74-0.82) for model based from low-power images and 0.74 (0.69-0.79) for the model based from high-power images. Cytomorphologic features were synthesized using feature engineering and when performed in isolation, they achieved AUC of 0.71 (0.64-0.77) for chromatin, 0.70 (0.64-0.73) for cellularity, 0.65 (0.60-0.69) for cytoarchitecture, 0.57 (0.51-0.61) for nuclear size, and 0.63 (0.57-0.68) for nuclear shape.Our study proves that ThinPrep is an excellent preparation method for digital image analysis of thyroid cytomorphology. It can be used to quantitatively harvest morphologic information for diagnostic purpose.","['Bethesda', 'Digital image analysis', 'Fine needle aspiration', 'ThinPrep', 'Thyroid']"
The early posterior cortex pixel value ratio: a novel reliable indicator for distraction osteogenesis.,"We aimed to explore the associations of the early PVR in four cortices with Healing Index (HI), Lengthening Index (LI), and External Fixator Index (EFI) in the bone union and non-union groups.A total of 52 patients, including 39 bone union and 13 bone non-union subjects, were recruited in this study. The general characteristics and PVR in four cortices in each group were explored. Afterward, the early PVR in four cortices, including medial, lateral, anterior, and posterior sides, were compared. Finally, the associations of the early PVR in four cortices with HI, LI, and EFI were also investigated.The general characteristics of these patients were consistent, except for HI (31.54 ± 12.24 vs. 45.08 ± 27.10, <i>P</i> = 0.018) and EFI (57.63 ± 18.15 vs. 71.29 ± 24.60, <i>P</i> = 0.046). The growth of regenerated callus was asymmetrical in the bone union group (the posterior PVR seems to grow faster), whereas no statistical difference was obtained in the bone non-union group. Furthermore, the posterior PVR in the bone union group was significantly higher than that in the bone non-union group (the first month: 0.96 ± 0.17 vs. 0.86 ± 0.06, <i>p</i> = 0.047; the second month: 0.98 ± 0.14 vs. 0.89 ± 0.09, <i>p</i> = 0.041; the third month: 1.00 ± 0.12 vs. 0.92 ± 0.09, <i>p</i> = 0.039). Most importantly, the posterior PVR was inversely associated with HI, LI, and EFI (the first month: <i>r</i> = -0.343, <i>p</i> = 0.041; <i>r</i> = -0.346, <i>p</i> = 0.042; <i>r</i> = -0.352, <i>p</i> = 0.041; the second month: <i>r</i> = -0.459, <i>p</i> = 0.004; <i>r</i> = -0.277, <i>p</i> = 0.101; <i>r</i> = -0.511, <i>p</i> = 0.002; the third month: <i>r</i> = -0.479, <i>p</i> = 0.003; <i>r</i> = -0.398, <i>p</i> = 0.018; <i>r</i> = -0.551, <i>p</i> = 0.001) in the bone union group, respectively. However, this finding was lost in the bone non-union group.The early posterior cortex PVR seems to grow faster than the medial, lateral, and anterior sides in the bone union group, which represents an asymmetrical development pattern. Moreover, the posterior cortex PVR was negatively associated with HI, LI, and EFI, respectively. The posterior cortex PVR may be a novel and reliable detection index in the process of DO.","['bone regeneration index', 'bone union and nonunion', 'distraction osteogenesis', 'external fixator', 'external fixator index', 'healing index', 'lengthening index', 'pixel value ratio']"
Correlation between dietary selenium intake and stroke in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2018.,"Epidemiologic evidence of the effect of dietary selenium intake on stroke risk remains controversial. This study aimed to examine the cross-sectional correlation between dietary selenium intake and the risk of stroke in adults.We retrospectively analysed 39,438 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2018, aged 20-85 years. Participants were divided into quartiles depending on daily dietary selenium intake: quartile 1 (0-77 μg), quartile 2 (77-108 μg), quartile 3 (108-148 μg), and quartile 4 (148-400 μg). The dose-response relationship was assessed using the restricted cubic spline function.The adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of stroke were 0.70 (0.55, 0.88) for participants in quartile 2, 0.71 (0.53, 0.93) for quartile 3, and 0.61 (0.43, 0.85) for quartile 4 compared with that in quartile 1. <i>p</i>-Value for trend through quartiles was .007. A non-linear negative correlation between dietary selenium intake and stroke was observed in the threshold effect analysis and restricted cubic spline function (<i>p</i>-value for non-linearity < .001). An initial decrease in odds of stroke lower than 105 μg/day selenium intake (0.61 [0.44, 0.85], <i>p</i> = .004) was followed by a platform beyond 105 μg/day (0.97 [0.81, 1.16], <i>p</i> = .723). In the subgroup analysis, adjusted ORs (95% CIs) of stroke were 0.51 (0.36, 0.70) for female participants, 0.63 (0.40, 0.99) for participants with age <60 years, 0.63 (0.47, 0.85) for participants with poverty-income ratio < 2.14, 0.66 (0.50, 0.87) for participants with overweight and obesity, 0.66 (0.52, 0.84) for participants with hypertension, 0.72 (0.53, 0.97) for participants without diabetes, and 0.72 (0.56, 0.92) for non-anaemic participants.Dietary selenium had a negative and non-linear correlation with the risk of stroke in adults. The correlation varied across different population subgroups.KEY MESSAGESDietary selenium had a negative and non-linear correlation with the risk of stroke in adults.Non-linear negative correlation trends were observed in subpopulations of females, age <60 years, poverty-income ratio <2.14, overweight and obesity, hypertension, non-diabetes, and non-anaemia.Dietary selenium intake of approximately 105 μg per day has an optimum effect on stroke.","['Dietary selenium intake', 'National Health And Nutrition Examination Survey', 'adults', 'negative correlation', 'nonlinear model', 'stroke']"
Effect of age adjustment on two triage methods.,"Most emergency departments rely on acuity assessment, triage, to recognize critically ill patients that need urgent treatment, and to allocate resources according to need. The accuracy of commonly used triage instruments such as the Emergency Severity Index (ESI) is lower for older adults compared to young patients. We aim to examine, whether adjusting the triage category by age leads to improvement in sensitivity without excessive increase in patient numbers in the higher triage categories. The primary outcome measure was 3-day mortality and secondary outcomes were 30-day mortality, hospital admission, and HDU/ICU admissions.We gathered data of all adult patients who had an unscheduled visit to any of our three emergency departments within one month. The data was analysed for 3-day mortality, 30-day mortality, hospital admission, and high dependency unit or intensive care unit (HDU/ICU) admission. The analysis was run for both the standard ESI triage method and a local 3-level Helsinki University Hospital (HUH) method. A further analysis was run for both triage methods with age adjustment. Net reclassification improvement values were calculated to demonstrate the effect of age adjustment.Thirteen thousand seven hundred fifty-nine patients met the study criteria, median age was 57. 3-day mortality AUCs for unadjusted HUH and ESI triage were 0.77 (0.65-0.88) and 0.72 (0.57-0.87); 30-day mortality AUCs were 0.64 (0.59-0.69) and 0.69 (0.64-0.73); hospital admission AUCs were 0.60 (0.68-0.71) and 0.66 (0.65-0.68) and HDU/ICU admission AUCs were 0.67 (0.64-0.70) and 0.82 (0.79-0.86), respectively. Age adjustment improved accuracy for 30-day mortality and hospital admission. With the threshold age of 80, AUCs for 30-day mortality were 0.73 (0.68-0.77) and 0.77 (0.73-0.81) and for hospital admission, 0.66 (0.65-0.67) and 0.72 (0.71-0.73) for the HUH and ESI triage. The effect was similar with all cut off ages.Moving older adults into a more urgent triage category based on age, improved the triage instruments' performance slightly in predicting 30-day mortality and hospital admission without excessive increase in patient numbers in the higher triage categories. Age adjustment did not improve HDU/ICU admission or 3-day mortality prediction.","['Acuity assessment', 'Emergency Department', 'Emergency Severity Index', 'Older adults', 'Triage']"
"Trajectories of e-cigarette advertising exposure, e-cigarette use and cigarette smoking in a sample of young adults from Hawaii.","To test whether intrapersonal growth in e-cigarette advertising exposure over time is associated with growth in e-cigarette use and/or cigarette smoking.Longitudinal study using four waves of data were collected in 6-month intervals between 2018 and 2020.Participants were 2327 young adults recruited from colleges in Hawaii, USA.Data were collected on demographics, e-cigarette advertising exposure measured using the cued- recall method and recent (past 30-day) cigarette and e-cigarette use.The average trajectory for e-cigarette advertising exposure over time was significant and upward [M slope = 0.18 (0.14-0.22), P < 0.0001]. However, average trajectories for e-cigarette [M slope = -0.08 (-0.18 to 0.02), P = 0.09] and cigarette [M slope = -0.14 (-0.30 to 0.02), P = 0.07] use were not. There were significant differences in individual level trajectories across participants for advertising exposure [σ<sup>2</sup>  = 0.12 (0.10-0.14), P < 0.0001], e-cigarette use [σ<sup>2</sup>  = 0.22 (0.14-0.30), and cigarette smoking (σ<sup>2</sup>  = 0.17 [0.09-0.25], P < 0.0001). Individuals with an increasing rate of advertising exposure showed an increasing rate of e-cigarette use [B = 0.63 (0.36-0.90), P < 0.0001). Neither initial level of, nor rate of change in, advertising exposure was significantly associated with cigarette smoking growth factors (P > 0.05). Higher initial level of e-cigarette use was associated with higher initial level of cigarette smoking [B = 0.89 (0.69-1.09), P < 0.0001] but decreased rate of cigarette smoking over time [B = -0.12 (-0.20 to -0.04) P = 0.003]. Rate of change in e-cigarette use was not associated with the rate of change in cigarette smoking (P > 0.05).Increased exposure to e-cigarette advertising appears to be associated with increased e-cigarette use but not with increased cigarette smoking. Higher initial level of e-cigarette use appears to be associated with higher initial level of cigarette smoking but may be associated with a decreasing rate of cigarette smoking over time.","['Cigarette smoking', 'ecigarette advertising', 'ecigarette use', 'longitudinal', 'multiethnic', 'young adults']"
Qiliqiangxin improves cardiac function and attenuates cardiac remodelling in doxorubicin-induced heart failure rats.,"<b>Context:</b> Therapeutic doxorubicin administration is restricted as this anticancer drug may be cardiotoxic. The traditional Chinese medicine qiliqiangxin has been approved for clinical treatment of chronic heart failure.<b>Objective:</b> To explore the protective effects and molecular mechanisms of qiliqiangxin on doxorubicin-induced congestive heart failure (CHF) in rats.<b>Materials and methods:</b> A CHF rat model was established via intraperitoneal DOX injections (2.5 mg/kg/week) for 6 weeks. The rats were randomly assigned to control, CHF, CHF + QL (1.0 g/kg/d), or captopril (3.8 mg/kg/d) treatment groups (<i>n</i> = 10) for 4 weeks. MicroRNA sequencing elucidated the molecular mechanisms of qiliqiangxin on doxorubicin-induced CHF in rats.<b>Results:</b> Unlike in the CHF group, QL significantly reduced Bax:Bcl-2 (2.05 ± 0.23 vs. 0.94 ± 0.09, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and the levels of collagen I (0.19 ± 0.02 vs. 0.15 ± 0.01, <i>p</i> < 0.05), collagen III (0.19 ± 0.02 vs. 0.14 ± 0.02, <i>p</i> < 0.05), TGF-β1 (5.28 ± 0.89 vs. 2.47 ± 0.51, <i>p</i> < 0.05), Smad3 (1.23 ± 0.12 vs. 0.78 ± 0.09, <i>p</i> < 0.05), MMP-2 (0.89 ± 0.01 vs. 0.53 ± 0.05, <i>p</i> < 0.05), and TIMP-2 (0.24 ± 0.03 vs. 0.44 ± 0.03, <i>p</i> < 0.05). QL also upregulated TGF-β3 (0.65 ± 0.06 vs. 0.96 ± 0.10, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and Smad7 (0.09 ± 0.01 vs. 0.19 ± 0.023, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Moreover, Smad3 was a target of miR-345-3p.<b>Discussion and Conclusions:</b> The beneficial effects of QL on DOX-induced CHF in rats are mediated by reduction in myocardial fibrosis, promotion of TGF-β3/Smad7, and inhibition of TGF-β1/Smad3. QL may also modulate specific miRNAs. These results provide evidence that QL might be an effective treatment for DOX-induced CHF.","['Chronic heart failure', 'TGFβ1Smad3', 'TGFβ3Smad7', 'miRNAs']"
Health Risk Assessment of Exposure to Heavy Metals from Sheep Meat and Offal in Kuwait.,"A total of 600 sheep samples (200 each of muscle, liver, and kidney) collected from 200 sheep carcasses slaughtered at abattoirs in Kuwait were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry for concentrations of mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and chromium (Cr). These metals were detected in all (100%) examined samples; higher concentrations occurred in kidney followed by liver and muscle. The mean (±standard error of the mean) values of the metals detected in sheep muscle, liver, and kidney samples were 0.320 ± 0.061, 0.488 ± 0.042, and 0.791 ± 0.152 μg/g, respectively for Hg; 349 ± 0.074, 0.504 ± 0.049, and 0.642 ± 0.113 μg/g, respectively, for As; 0.482 ± 0.098, 0.567 ± 0.042, and 0.706 ± 0.098 μg/g, respectively, for Pb; 0.301 ± 0.344, 0.433 ± 0.032, and 0.586 ± 0.064 μg/g, respectively, for Cd; and 0.362 ± 0.064, 0.585 ± 0.044, and 0.738 ± 0.111 μg/g, respectively, for Cr. The concentrations of all heavy metals except Cr exceeded the maximum permissible limits set by various international food agencies. The estimated daily intake of each metal was lower than its provisional tolerable daily intake. The target hazard quotient and hazard index values for Hg were >1.0 in all examined sheep samples, suggesting significant health risks to the public from the consumption of sheep meat and offal marketed in Kuwait.","['Heavy metals', 'Residues', 'Risk assessment', 'Sheep meat']"
Genetic parameters and relationships between growth traits and scrotal circumference measured at different ages in Nellore cattle.,"Records from 106,212 Nellore animals, born between 1998 and 2006, were used to estimate (co)variance components and genetic parameters for birth weight (BW), average weight gains from birth to weaning (GBW), average weight gains from weaning to after yearling (GWAY), weaning hip height (WHH), postweaning hip height (PHH) and scrotal circumferences at 9 (SC9), 12 (SC12) and 15 (SC15) months of age. (Co)variance components were estimated by an animal model using multi-trait analysis. Heritability estimates for BW, GBW, GWAY, WHH, PHH, SC9, SC12 and SC15 were 0.31 ± 0.01; 0.25 ± 0.02; 0.30 ± 0.04; 0.51 ± 0.04; 0.54 ± 0.04; 0.39 ± 0.01; 0.41 ± 0.01 and 0.44 ± 0.02, respectively. Genetic correlations between growth traits ranged from 0.09 ± 0.01 to 0.88 ± 0.01, thereby implying that, at any age, selection to increase average weight gains will also increase stature. Genetic correlations between BW and average weight gains with scrotal circumferences were all positive and moderate (0.15 ± 0.03 to 0.38 ± 0.01). On the other hand, positive and low genetic associations were estimated between hip height and scrotal circumference at different ages (0.09 ± 0.01 to 0.17 ± 0.02). The results of this study pointed out that selection to larger scrotal circumferences in males will promote changes in average weight gains. In order to obtain Nellore cattle with the stature and size suitable for the production system, both weight gain and hip height should be included in a selection index.","['average weight gain', 'beef cattle', 'genetic correlation', 'hip height']"
Validity and Reliability of Inertial Measurement Units on Lower Extremity Kinematics During Running: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Inertial measurement units (IMUs) are useful in monitoring running and alerting running-related injuries in various sports settings. However, the quantitative summaries of the validity and reliability of the measurements from IMUs during running are still lacking. The purpose of this review was to investigate the concurrent validity and test-retest reliability of IMUs for measuring gait spatiotemporal outcomes and lower extremity kinematics of health adults during running.PubMed, CINAHL, Embase, Scopus and Web of Science electronic databases were searched from inception until September 2021. The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) evaluated the validity or reliability of measurements from IMUs, (2) measured specific kinematic outcomes, (3) compared measurements using IMUs with those obtained using reference systems, (4) collected data during running, (5) assessed human beings and (6) were published in English. Eligible articles were reviewed using a modified quality assessment. A meta-analysis was performed to assess the pooled correlation coefficients of validity and reliability.Twenty-five articles were included in the systematic review, and data from 12 were pooled for meta-analysis. The methodological quality of studies ranged from low to moderate. Concurrent validity is excellent for stride length (intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) (95% confidence interval (CI)) = 0.937 (0.859, 0.972), p < 0.001), step frequency (ICC (95% CI) = 0.926 (0.896, 0.948), r (95% CI) = 0.989 (0.957, 0.997), p  < 0.001) and ankle angle in the sagittal plane (r (95% CI) = 0.939 (0.544, 0.993), p = 0.002), moderate to excellent for stance time (ICC (95% CI) = 0.664 (0.354, 0.845), r (95% CI) = 0.811 (0.701, 0.881), p < 0.001) and good for running speed (ICC (95% CI) = 0.848 (0.523, 0.958), p = 0.0003). The summary Fisher's Z value of flight time was not statistically significant (p = 0.13). Similarly, the stance time showed excellent test-retest reliability (ICC (95% CI) = 0.954 (0.903, 0.978), p < 0.001) and step frequency showed good test-retest reliability (ICC (95% CI) = 0.896 (0.837, 0.933), p < 0.001).Findings in the current review support IMUs measurement of running gait spatiotemporal parameters, but IMUs measurement of running kinematics on lower extremity joints needs to be reported with caution in healthy adults.PROSPERO Registration Number: CRD42021279395.","['Inertial measurement unit', 'Kinematics', 'Reliability', 'Running', 'Validity']"
Changes in peripheral T-lymphocyte subsets and serum cytokines in patients with systemic sclerosis.,"<b>Objective:</b> T cells represent a predominant cell type in autoimmune disease. However, their exact roles are not fully clear in systemic sclerosis (SSc). This study aimed to mainly investigate the alteration in the absolute numbers of T-lymphocyte subsets and the serum levels of cytokines in SSc patients. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 76 patients with SSc and 76 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled. The levels of circulating T cell subsets and serum cytokines were measured by flow cytometry. T cell subsets or serum cytokines correlations with disease activity and organ involvement were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> The absolute numbers of Th2 and Treg cells in SSc patients were lower than those in HCs (<i>p</i> < 0.05), resulting in the ratios of Th1/Th2 [25.01 (12.24, 38.61) vs. 11.64 (6.38, 20.34)] and Th17/Treg [0.42 (0.17, 0.66) vs. 0.17 (0.13, 0.29)] were increased significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The absolute numbers of total T, Th, and Treg cells were negatively correlated with CRP (<i>r</i> = -0.406, <i>p</i> = 0.002; <i>r</i> = -0.263, <i>p</i> < 0.05; <i>r</i> = -0.367 <i>p</i> < 0.01). The serum levels of IL-2, SIL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, INF-γ, and TNF-α were significantly higher than those in HCs (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Increasing IL-2 in the wake of the augment of ESR (<i>r</i> = 0.671, <i>p</i> = 0.004), so did IL-6 (<i>r</i> = 0.378, <i>p</i> < 0.05). The ratio of Th17/Treg in SSc-ILD patients had lower levels than that in other patients [0.35 (0.14, 0.53) vs. 0.64 (0.26, 0.93) <i>p</i> = 0.028]; Treg cells were lessened in patients with Raynaud's phenomenon relative to controls [3.00 (2.41, 4.28) vs. 3.55 (2.86, 4.53) <i>p</i> < 0.05].

Effect of Theta Burst Stimulation-Patterned rTMS on Motor and Nonmotor Dysfunction of Parkinson's Disease: A Systematic Review and Metaanalysis.,"<b>Background:</b> Theta burst stimulation (TBS), a type of patterned repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), has several advantages, such as short time of single treatment and low stimulation intensity compared with traditional rTMS. Since the efficacy of TBS on the symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) was inconsistent among different studies, we systematically searched these studies and quantitatively analyzed the therapeutic effect of TBS for patients with PD. <b>Methods:</b> We followed the recommended PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews. Studies from PubMed, EMBASE, CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov from January 1, 2005 of each database to September 30, 2021 were analyzed. We also manually retrieved studies of reference. <b>Results:</b> Eight eligible studies with 189 participants (received real TBS and/or sham TBS) were included. This metaanalysis found that TBS did not significantly improve Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale part III (UPDRS-III) score in the ""on"" medicine state (SMD = -0.06; 95% CI, -0.37 to 0.25; <i>p</i> = 0.69; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%), while, it brought significant improvement of UPDRS-III scores in the ""off"" medicine state (SMD = -0.37; 95% CI, -0.65 to -0.09; <i>p</i> < 0.01; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 19%). Subgroup analysis found that merely continuous TBS (cTBS) over the supplementary motor area (SMA) brought significant improvement of UPDRS-III score (SMD = -0.63; 95% CI, -1.02 to -0.25; <i>p</i> < 0.01). TBS had insignificant effectiveness for upper limb movement disorder both in the ""on"" and ""off"" medicine status (SMD = -0.07; 95% CI, -0.36 to 0.22; <i>p</i> = 0.64; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%; SMD = -0.21; 95% CI, -0.57 to 0.15; <i>p</i> = 0.26; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%; respectively). TBS significantly improved slowing of gait in the ""off"" medicine status (SMD = -0.37; 95% CI, -0.71 to -0.03; <i>p</i> = 0.03; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%). Subgroup analysis suggested that only intermittent TBS (iTBS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) + dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) had significant difference (SMD = -0.57; 95% CI, -1.13 to -0.01; <i>p</i> = 0.04). Additionally, iTBS over the M1+ DLPFC had a short-term (within 2 weeks) therapeutic effect on PD depression (MD = -2.93; 95% CI, -5.52 to -0.33; <i>p</i> = 0.03). <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study demonstrated that cTBS over the SMA could significantly improve the UPDRS-III score for PD patients in the ""off,"" not in the ""on,"" medicine state. TBS could not bring significant improvement of upper limb movement dysfunction. ITBS over the M1+DLPFC could significantly improve the slowing of gait in the ""off"" medicine status. Additionally, iTBS over the M1+DLPFC has a short-term (within 2 weeks) therapeutic effect on PD depression. Further RCTs of a large sample, and excellent design are needed to confirm our conclusions.","['Parkinsons disease', 'metaanalysis', 'noninvasive brain stimulation', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation', 'theta burst stimulation']"
"Relationship Between Sarcopenia, Obesity, Osteoporosis, and Cardiometabolic Health Conditions and Physical Activity Levels in Korean Older Adults.","This study aimed to analyze the status of sarcopenia, obesity, osteoporosis, and cardiometabolic disease according to the level of physical activity (PA) among elderly people in Korea. Among the data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Survey (2008-2011), we analyzed the data of a total of 3,573 Korean elderly people over 65 years of age who were surveyed for dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and PA. Higher levels of PA were associated with a lower prevalence of cardiometabolic disease (χ<sup>2</sup> = 33.865, <i>p</i> < 0.001), osteoporosis (χ<sup>2</sup> = 94.198, <i>p</i> < 0.001), sarcopenia, obesity, and sarcopenic obesity (χ<sup>2</sup> = 71.828, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Above moderate-active PA was associated with lower body weight (<i>p</i> < 0.001), body fat mass (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and percent body fat (<i>p</i> < 0.001), and higher free-fat mass (<i>p</i> < 0.001) and appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM) (<i>p</i> < 0.001) than in low-active PA. In addition, when high-active is the risk factors of cardiometabolic were lower in waist circumference (<i>p</i> = 0.001), total cholesterol (TC) (<i>p</i> = 0.015), and triglyceride (TG) (<i>p</i> < 0.001) than low- and moderate-active PA, and higher in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (<i>p</i> < 0.001). The prevalence of cardiometabolic diseases was significantly decreased in high-active PA (odds ratio (OR) 0.60, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.50-0.71); waist circumference (OR 0.85, 95% CI, 0.73-0.99; OR 0.59, 95% CI, 0.50-0.70) and HDL-C (OR 0.76, 95% CI, 0.65-0.88; OR 0.56, 95% CI, 0.47-0.67) significantly improved in moderate- and high-active PA, respectively, and TG (0.67 95% CI, 0.55-0.80) significantly improved in high-active PA. Osteoporosis (OR 0.62, 95% CI, 0.53-0.74; OR 0.46, 95% CI, 0.38-0.55) and sarcopenia (OR 0.77, 95% CI, 0.60-0.98; OR 0.73, 95% CI, 0.57-0.93) were significantly improved in moderate- and high-active PA, respectively. The incidence of obesity (OR 0.47, 95% CI, 0.39-0.57) and sarcopenic obesity (OR 0.47, 95% CI, 0.30-0.75) were significantly decreased in high-active PA. Therefore, we verified a lower prevalence of sarcopenia, osteoporosis, obesity, and cardiac metabolic disease in Korean elderly with more active PA. This suggests that more active PA maybe reduce the prevalence of sarcopenia, osteoporosis, obesity, and cardiometabolic diseases in older adults.","['cardiometabolic disease', 'elderly population', 'metabolic syndrome', 'obesity', 'osteoporosis', 'physical activity level', 'sarcopenia']"
Effects of calcium supplementation on body weight: a meta-analysis.,"Whether calcium supplementation can reduce body weight and prevent obesity remains unclear because of inconsistent reports.We performed a meta-analysis to investigate the correlations between calcium supplementation and changes in body weight on the basis of age, sex, body mass index (BMI) of the subjects, and length of calcium intervention.PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were systematically searched to select relevant studies that were published from January 1994 to March 2016. Both randomized controlled trials and longitudinal studies of calcium supplementation were included, and random- or fixed-effects models in a software program were used for the data analysis.Thirty-three studies involving a total of 4733 participants were included in this meta-analysis. No significant differences in weight changes were shown between calcium intervention and control groups (mean: -0.01 kg; 95% CI -0.02, 0.00 kg; P = 0.12). However, negative correlations between calcium supplementation and weight changes were shown in children and adolescents (mean: -0.26 kg; 95% CI: -0.41, -0.11 kg; P < 0.001) and in adult men and either premenopausal or old (>60 y of age) women (mean: -0.91 kg; 95% CI: -1.38, -0.44 kg; P < 0.001) but not in postmenopausal women (mean: -0.14 kg; 95% CI: -0.54, 0.26 kg; P = 0.50). When BMI was considered, a negative correlation between calcium supplementation and weight changes was observed in subjects with normal BMI (mean: -0.53 kg; 95% CI: -0.89, -0.16 kg; P = 0.005) but not in overweight or obese subjects (mean: -0.35 kg; 95% CI: -0.81, 0.11 kg; P = 0.14). Compared with the control groups, no differences in weight changes were shown in the calcium-intervention groups when the lengths of calcium interventions were <6 mo (mean: -0.09 kg; 95% CI: -0.45, 0.26 kg; P = 0.60) or ≥6 mo (mean: -0.01 kg; 95% CI: -0.02, 0.01 kg; P = 0.46).Increasing calcium intake through calcium supplements can reduce body weight in subjects who have a normal BMI or in children and adolescents, adult men, or premenopausal women.","['body mass index', 'body weight', 'calcium', 'metaanalysis', 'obesity']"
Meta-analysis of the Diagnostic Performance of Circulating MicroRNAs for Pancreatic Cancer.,"<b>Background</b>: Numerous studies have suggested that differentially expressed miRNAs may be promising diagnostic markers for pancreatic cancer (PC), but the results are inconsistent. We aimed to summarize the diagnostic accuracy of circulating miRNAs, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and the combination of miRNAs and CA19-9. <b>Material and Methods</b>: A literature search of online databases including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and WanFang was conducted. Relative data were extracted from eligible included studies, and a meta-analysis was performed. <b>Results</b>: A total of 46 studies involving 4,326 PC patients and 4,277 non-PC controls were included. The pooled sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE) and AUC of the circulating miRNAs for differentiating PC patients from non-PC controls were 0.79 (0.77-0.81), 0.77 (0.75-0.79), and 0.85 (0.81-0.87), respectively. The combination of miRNAs and CA19-9 greatly improved the SEN, SPE and AUC to 0.84 (0.80-0.87), 0.91 (0.89-0.93) and 0.94 (0.92-0.96), respectively. Moreover, circulating miRNAs also yielded an acceptable diagnostic accuracy for early-stage PC with a SEN of 0.79 (0.76-0.82), a SPE of 0.74 (0.68-0.79) and an AUC of 0.81 (0.77-0.84). <b>Conclusion</b>: Circulating miRNAs exhibited satisfactory diagnostic performance for PC and even early-stage PC. The combination of circulating miRNAs and CA19-9 can further improve the diagnostic accuracy, providing a novel strategy for PC diagnosis.","['circulating', 'diagnosis', 'metaanalysis', 'microRNAs', 'pancreatic cancer']"
The Efficacy and Safety of Laparoscopy for Blunt Abdominal Trauma: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The efficacy and safety of laparoscopy for blunt trauma remain controversial. This systemic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the usefulness of laparoscopy in blunt trauma. The PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases were searched up to 23 February 2021. Meta-analyses were performed using odds ratios (ORs), standardized mean differences (SMDs), and overall proportions. Overall, 19 studies with a total of 1520 patients were included. All patients were hemodynamically stable. In the laparoscopy group, meta-analysis showed lesser blood loss (SMD -0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.51 to -0.05, I<sup>2</sup> = 62%) and shorter hospital stay (SMD -0.67, 95% CI -0.90 to -0.43, I<sup>2</sup> = 47%) compared with the laparotomy group. Pooled prevalence of missed injury (0.003 (95% CI 0 to 0.023), I<sup>2</sup> = 0%), nontherapeutic laparotomy (0.004 (95% CI 0.001 to 0.026), I<sup>2</sup> = 0%), and mortality (0.021 (95% CI 0.010 to 0.043), I<sup>2</sup> = 0%) were very low in blunt trauma. In subgroup analysis, recently published studies (2011-present) showed lesser conversion rate (0.115 (95% CI 0.067 to 0.190) vs. 0.391 (95% CI 0.247 to 0.556), test for subgroup difference: <i>p</i> < 0.01). This meta-analysis suggests that laparoscopy is a safe and feasible option in hemodynamic stable patients with blunt abdominal trauma.","['blunt trauma', 'laparoscopy', 'laparotomy', 'metaanalysis', 'penetrating trauma']"
Impulse oscillometry in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension: an exploratory study.,"Studies suggest peripheral airway abnormalities in Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH). Impulse Oscillometry (IOS) is a noninvasive and sensitive technique for assessing the small airways. It evaluates the impedance of the respiratory system ‒ Resistance (R) and reactance (X) ‒ to a pulse of sound waves sent to the lungs, in a range of frequencies (5‒20 Hz).Resistance variables: R5, R20, R5-R20 and reactance variables: AX (reactance area) and Fres (resonance frequency). The aim is to evaluate R and X in patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and to investigate whether there is a correlation between IOS and spirometry.Thirteen IPAH patients and 11 healthy subjects matched for sex and age underwent IOS and spirometry. IPAH patients had lower FVC and FEV<sub>1</sub> values (p < 0.001), VEF<sub>1</sub>/CVF (p = 0.049) and FEF 25-75 (p = 0.006) than healthy patients. At IOS, IPAH patients showed lower tidal volumes and higher AX (p < 0.05) compared to healthy individuals, and 53.8 of patients had R5-R20 values ≥ 0.07 kPa/L/s. Correlation analysis: X5, AX, R5-R20 and Fres showed moderate correlation with FVC (p = 0.036 r = 0.585, p = 0.001 r = -0.687, p = 0.005 r = -0.726 and p = 0.027 r = -0.610); Fres (p = 0.012 r = -0.669) and AX (p = 0.006 r = -0.711) correlated with FEV<sub>1</sub>; [R5 and R20, (R5-R20)] also correlated with FEV<sub>1</sub> (p < 0.001 r = -0.573, p = 0.020 r = -0.634 and p = 0.010 r = -0.683, respectively) in the IPAH group. There were also moderate correlations of FEF 25-75 % with Z5 (p = 0.041), R5 (p = 0.018), Fres (p = 0.043) and AX (p = 0.023).Patients showed changes suggestive of increased resistance and reactance in the IOS compared to healthy individuals, and the IOS findings showed a good correlation with spirometry variables.","['Impulse oscillometry', 'Lung function', 'Pulmonary arterial hypertension', 'Pulmonary hypertension', 'Spirometry']"
<i>Limosilactobacillus reuteri</i> DSM 17938-Containing Infant Formulas and the Associations with Gastrointestinal Tolerance: A Cross-Sectional Observational Study.,"<i>Limosilactobacillus</i> (<i>L</i>.; previously <i>Lactobacillus</i>) <i>reuteri</i> has been shown to influence gastrointestinal (GI) tolerance. This study was a secondary analysis of GI tolerance data from a multi-country, cross-sectional, observational study in healthy infants using the validated Infant Gastrointestinal Symptom Questionnaire (IGSQ) and a gut comfort questionnaire. Breastfed infants (BFI; <i>n</i> = 760) were compared to formula-fed infants receiving either <i>L. reuteri</i>-containing formula (FFI + LR; <i>n</i> = 470) or standard formula without any probiotic or prebiotic (FFI-Std; <i>n</i> = 501). The IGSQ composite scores (adjusted mean ± SE) in FFI + LR (22.17 ± 0.39) was significantly lower than in FFI-Std (23.41 ± 0.37) and similar to BFI (22.34 ± 0.30;), indicating better GI tolerance in FFI + LR than in FFI-Std. Compared with FFI-Std, FFI + LR had lower reports of difficulty in passing stools (11% vs. 22%; adjusted-odds ratio (OR) (95%CI) = 0.46 (0.31-0.68)), fewer hard stools (mean difference = -0.12 (-0.21, -0.02)) and less physician-confirmed colic (OR = 0.61 (0.45-0.82)), and similar to BFI. Parent-reported crying time (mean difference = -0.15 (-0.28, -0.01)), frequency of spitting-up/vomiting (mean difference = -0.18 (-0.34, -0.03)), volume of spit-up (mean difference = -0.20 (-0.32, -0.08)) and fussiness due to spitting-up/vomiting (mean difference = -0.17 (-0.29, -0.05)) were lower in FFI + LR versus FFI-Std and similar to BFI. In this study, <i>L. reuteri</i>-containing formula was associated with improved digestive tolerance and behavioral patterns.","['colic', 'gastrointestinal tolerance', 'infant', 'infant formula', 'nutrition', 'probiotics']"
Clinical Utility of 4C Mortality Scores among Japanese COVID-19 Patients: A Multicenter Study.,"We analyzed data from COVID-19 patients in Japan to assess the utility of the 4C mortality score as compared with conventional scorings.In this multicenter study, COVID-19 patients hospitalized between March 2020 and June 2021, over 16 years old, were recruited. The superiority for correctly predicting mortality and severity by applying the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was compared. A Cox regression model was used to compare the length of hospitalization for each risk group of 4C mortality score.Among 206 patients, 21 patients died. The area under the curve (AUC) (95% confidential interval (CI)) of the ROC curve for mortality and severity, respectively, of 4C mortality scores (0.84 (95% CI 0.76-0.92) and 0.85 (95% CI 0.80-0.91)) were higher than those of qSOFA (0.66 (95% CI 0.53-0.78) and 0.67 (95% CI 0.59-0.75)), SOFA (0.70 (95% CI 0.55-0.84) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.74-0.89)), A-DROP (0.78 (95% CI 0.69-0.88) and 0.81 (95% CI 0.74-0.88)), and CURB-65 (0.82 (95% CI 0.74-0.90) and 0.82 (95% CI 0.76-0.88)). For length of hospitalization among survivors, the intermediate- and high- or very high-risk groups had significantly lower hazard ratios, i.e., 0.48 (95% CI 0.30-0.76)) and 0.23 (95% CI 0.13-0.43) for discharge.The 4C mortality score is better for estimating mortality and severity in COVID-19 Japanese patients than other scoring systems.","['4C mortality score', 'COVID19', 'clinical score', 'length of hospitalization', 'mortality', 'severity']"
The mediating role of attention deficit in relationship between insomnia and social cognition tasks among nurses in Saudi Arabia: A cross-sectional study.,"Insomnia-related affective functional disorder may negatively affect social cognition such as empathy, altruism, and attitude toward providing care. No previous studies have ever investigated the mediating role of attention deficit in the relationship between insomnia and social cognition.A cross-sectional survey was carried out among 664 nurses (M<sub>age</sub> = 33.03 years; SD ± 6.93 years) from December 2020 to September 2021. They completed the Scale of Attitude towards the Patient (SAtP), the Athens Insomnia Scale (AIS), a single-item numeric rating scale assessing the increasing severity of attention complaints, and questions relating to socio-demographic information. The analysis was carried out by examining the mediating role of attention deficit in the relationship between insomnia and social cognition.The prevalence of insomnia symptoms was high (52% insomnia using the AIS). Insomnia was significantly correlated with attention problems (<i>b</i> = 0.18, standard error (<i>SE</i>) = 0.02, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Attention problems were significantly negatively correlated with nurses' attitudes towards patients (b = -0.56, SE = 0.08, <i>p</i> < 0.001), respect for autonomy (b = -0.18, SE = 0.03, <i>p</i> < 0.001), holism (b = -0.14, SE = 0.03, <i>p</i> < 0.001), empathy (b = -0.15, SE = 0.03, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and altruism (b = -0.10, SE = 0.02, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Attention problems indirectly mediated the effect of insomnia on attitudes toward patients (99% CI = -0.10 [-0.16 to -0.05]), respect for autonomy (99% CI = -0.03 [-0.05 to -0.02]), holism (99% CI = -0.02 [-0.04 to -0.01]) empathy (99% CI = -0.03 [-0.04 to -0.01]), and altruism (99% CI = -0.02 [-0.03 to -0.01]).Nurses with insomnia-related attention problems are likely to have poor explicit social cognition such as attitude toward patients, altruism, empathy, respect for autonomy, and holism.","['Affective disorder', 'Altruism', 'Attention disorder', 'Empathy', 'Executive functions', 'Explicit cognition', 'Insomnia', 'Patient care', 'Sleep', 'Social cognition']"
Potential Biomarkers for Fat from Dairy and Fish and Their Association with Cardiovascular Risk Factors: Cross-sectional Data from the LifeLines Biobank and Cohort Study.,"Dairy fat intake, reflected by the biomarkers C14:0, C15:0, C17:0, trans-C16:1 (<i>n</i>-7), trans-C18:1 (<i>n</i>-7) and CLA, may have beneficial effects on cardiovascular health. It has, however, been questioned whether this association is genuine, since C15:0 and C17:0 are also biomarkers from fish. We investigated whether the above biomarkers are reliable markers for dairy fat intake in 864 healthy subjects. Subsequently, we explored the association between these biomarkers and cardiovascular risk factors. Intakes of dairy and fish were determined by Food Frequency Questionnaires FFQs. Fatty acids were analyzed in plasma triglycerides (TG) and phospholipids (PL). Median intakes of dairy and fish fat were 12.3 (8.4-17.4) g/day and 1.14 (0.53-1.75) g/day. All fatty acids, except TG C17:0, were associated with dairy fat (std.β range TG: 0.12 for C14:0 till 0.25 for C15:0 and Trans-C18:1 (<i>n</i>-7); and std.β range PL: 0.12 for C17:0 and Trans-C16:1 (<i>n</i>-7) till 0.24 for Trans-C18:1 (<i>n</i>-7) and CLA; <i>p</i> < 0.001). TG C17:0 was associated with fish fat (std.<i>β</i> = 0.08; <i>p</i> = 0.03), whereas PL C17:0 was not. Associations remained after adjustment for fish/dairy fat intake. Strongest inverse associations with biological variables were found with PL C17:0 and Trans-C18:1 (<i>n</i>-7) (Std.βs: waist circumference: -0.18, <i>p</i> < 0.001 and -0.10, <i>p</i> < 0.05; BMI: -0.17, <i>p</i> < 0.001, -0.11, <i>p</i> < 0.01; glucose: -0.10, <i>p</i> <0.01 and -0.08, <i>p</i> <0.05; high sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP): -0.22, <i>p</i> < 0.001 and -0.16, <i>p</i> < 0.01; uric acid: -0.27, <i>p</i> < 0.001 and -0.24, <i>p</i> < 0.001). In conclusion, fatty acid biomarkers, except plasma TG C17:0, were associated with dairy fat intake, independent of fish fat intake. PL C17:0 and trans-C18:1 (<i>n</i>-7) were inversely associated with adiposity, diabetes, inflammation and uric acid.","['biomarkers', 'cardiovascular diseases', 'cardiovascular risk Factors', 'crosssectional', 'dairy', 'fatty acids', 'fish']"
"Predictive value of perioperative procalcitonin, C reactive protein and high-sensitivity C reactive protein for the risk of postoperative complications after non-cardiac surgery in elderly patients: a nested case-control study.","Little is known about the correlation between perioperative concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers and postoperative complications. This study explored whether the plasma concentrations and perioperative changes of procalcitonin (PCT), C reactive protein (CRP) and high-sensitivity CRP (hsCRP) could predict the risk of postoperative morbidity in elderly patients undergoing elective non-cardiac surgery.A nested case-control study.A tertiary hospital in China.A total of 498 patients aged ≥65 years from a prospective cohort who underwent elective non-cardiac surgery between June 2020 and April 2021.The primary outcomes were the efficacy of plasma concentrations of PCT, CRP and hsCRP in predicting the risk of Clavien-Dindo Classification (CDC) ≥grade 3 and major complications. The major complications included mortality, an intensive care unit stay length >24 hour, cardiovascular events, acute kidney injury, postoperative cognitive dysfunction and infections.For major complications, the area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI) of PCT-24 hours, PCT change and PCT change rate were 0.750 (0.698 to 0.803), 0.740 (0.686 to 0.795) and 0.711 (0.651 to 0.771), respectively.

"Genetic and phenotypic correlations among feed efficiency, immune and production traits in indigenous chicken of Kenya.","This study aimed at estimating genetic and phenotypic relationships among feed efficiency, immune and production traits measured pre- (9-20 weeks of age) and post- (12 weeks from on-set of lay) maturity. Production traits were average daily gain (ADG) and average daily feed-intake (ADFI<sub>1</sub>) in the pre-maturity period and age at first egg (AFE), average daily feed-intake (ADFI<sub>2</sub>) and average daily egg mass (EM) in the post-maturity period. Feed efficiency comprised of residual feed intake (RFI) estimated in both periods. Natural antibodies binding to keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH-IgM) and specific antibodies binding to Newcastle disease virus (NDV-IgG) measured at 16 and 28 weeks of age represented immune traits pre- and post-maturity, respectively. In the growing period, 1,820 records on ADG, KLH-IgM and NDV-IgG, and 1,559 records on ADFI<sub>1</sub> and RFI were available for analyses. In the laying period, 1,340 records on AFE, EM, KLH-IgM and NDV-IgG, and 1,288 records on ADFI<sub>2</sub> and RFI were used in the analyses. Bi-variate animal mixed model was fitted to estimate (co)variance components, heritability and correlations among the traits. The model constituted sex, population, generation, line and genotype as fixed effects, and animal and residual effects as random variables. During the growing period, moderate to high heritability (0.36-0.68) was estimated for the production traits and RFI while the antibody traits had low (0.10-0.22) heritability estimates. Post-maturity, the production traits and RFI were moderately (0.30-0.37) heritable while moderate to high (0.25-0.41) heritability was estimated for the antibody traits. Genetic correlations between feed efficiency and production traits in both periods showed that RFI had negative genetic correlations with ADG (-0.47) and EM (-0.56) but was positively correlated with ADFI<sub>1</sub> (0.60), ADFI<sub>2</sub> (0.74) and AFE (0.35). Among immune and production traits, KLH-IgM and NDV-IgG had negative genetic correlations with ADG (-0.22; -0.56), AFE (-0.39; -0.42) and EM (-0.35; -0.16) but were positively correlated with ADFI<sub>1</sub> (0.41; 0.34) and ADFI<sub>2</sub> (0.47; 0.52). Genetic correlations between RFI with KLH-IgM (0.62; 0.33) and NDV-IgG (0.58; 0.50) were positive in both production periods. Feed intake, RFI and antibody traits measured in both production periods were positively correlated with estimates ranging from 0.48 to 0.82. Results from this study indicate selection possibilities to improve production, feed efficiency and immune-competence in indigenous chicken. The genetic correlations suggest that improved feed efficiency would be associated with high growth rates, early maturing chicken, high egg mass and reduced feed intake. In contrast, improved general (KLH-IgM) and specific (NDV-IgG) immunity would result in lower growth rates and egg mass but associated with early sexual maturation and high feed intake. Unfavorable genetic correlations between feed efficiency and immune traits imply that chicken of higher productivity and antibody levels will consume more feed to support both functions. These associations indicate that selective breeding for feed efficiency and immune-competence may have genetic consequences on production traits and should therefore be accounted for in indigenous chicken improvement programs.","['feed efficiency', 'genetic parameters', 'immunity', 'indigenous chicken', 'production']"
Evaluation of Pulmonary Nodules by Radiologists vs. Radiomics in Stand-Alone and Complementary CT and MRI.,"Increased attention has been given to MRI in radiation-free screening for malignant nodules in recent years. Our objective was to compare the performance of human readers and radiomic feature analysis based on stand-alone and complementary CT and MRI imaging in classifying pulmonary nodules. This single-center study comprises patients with CT findings of pulmonary nodules who underwent additional lung MRI and whose nodules were classified as benign/malignant by resection. For radiomic features analysis, 2D segmentation was performed for each lung nodule on axial CT, T2-weighted (T2w), and diffusion (DWI) images. The 105 extracted features were reduced by iterative backward selection. The performance of radiomics and human readers was compared by calculating accuracy with Clopper-Pearson confidence intervals. Fifty patients (mean age 63 +/- 10 years) with 66 pulmonary nodules (40 malignant) were evaluated. ACC values for radiomic features analysis vs. radiologists based on CT alone (0.68; 95%CI: 0.56, 0.79 vs. 0.59; 95%CI: 0.46, 0.71), T2w alone (0.65; 95%CI: 0.52, 0.77 vs. 0.68; 95%CI: 0.54, 0.78), DWI alone (0.61; 95%CI:0.48, 0.72 vs. 0.73; 95%CI: 0.60, 0.83), combined T2w/DWI (0.73; 95%CI: 0.60, 0.83 vs. 0.70; 95%CI: 0.57, 0.80), and combined CT/T2w/DWI (0.83; 95%CI: 0.72, 0.91 vs. 0.64; 95%CI: 0.51, 0.75) were calculated. This study is the first to show that by combining quantitative image information from CT, T2w, and DWI datasets, pulmonary nodule assessment through radiomics analysis is superior to using one modality alone, even exceeding human readers' performance.","['CT', 'MRI', 'artificial intelligence', 'pulmonary nodule', 'radiomics']"
Biologic Disease-Modifying Antirheumatic Drugs for Preventing Radiographic Progression in Psoriatic Arthritis: A Systematic Review and Network Meta-Analysis.,"The prevention of joint deformity is among the most important treatment goals of psoriatic arthritis. Some biologics disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (bDMARDs) have been demonstrated to be effective for both the skin and joints, as well as for slowing radiographic progression. However, there has been a lack of direct comparisons of bDMARDs. To evaluate the comparative effects of bDMARDs in preventing radiographic progression in psoriatic arthritis, we conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis. On March 7 2022, a search for relevant randomized trials was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Our outcomes included radiographic non-progression, a mean change in the total radiographic score, and adverse events leading to discontinuation (DAE) at week 24. We included 11 trials on 10 bDMARDs, involving 4010 participants. Most bDMARDs were more effective than placebos in achieving radiographic non-progression, including adalimumab (odds ratio (OR) 4.7, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.66-8.29), etanercept (OR 4.19, 95% CI 1.65-10.61), certolizumab pegol (OR 2.83, 95% CI 1.55-5.2), secukinumab 300 mg (OR 2.63, CI 1.62-4.27), infliximab (OR 2.54, CI 1.13-5.69), ixekizumab (OR 2.22, 95% CI 1.06-4.65), golimumab (OR 2.21, 95% CI 1.24-3.93), and abatacept (OR 1.54, 95% CI 1.03-2.28). A significant reduction in the total radiographic score was found in infliximab (standardized mean difference (SMD) -0.59, 95% CI -0.87, -0.3), etanercept (SMD -0.51, 95% CI -0.78, -0.23), adalimumab (SMD -0.45, 95% CI -0.64, -0.26), ixekizumab (SMD -0.37, 95% CI -0.62, -0.12), secukinumab 300 mg (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.50, -0.15), golimumab (SMD -0.33, 95% CI -0.58, -0.09), secukinumab 150 mg (SMD -0.25, 95% CI -0.43, -0.07), certolizumab pegol (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.44, -0.03), and ustekinumab (SMD -0.19, 95% CI -0.35, -0.33). No significant differences in DAE were detected between bDMARDs. In conclusion, anti-tumor necrosis factor agents (adalimumab, infliximab, and etanercept) may be preferred for treating psoriatic arthritis for their superiority in preventing radiographic progression.","['biologic', 'biologic diseasemodifying antirheumatic drugs bDMARDs', 'psoriatic arthritis', 'radiographic progression']"
"Quality of advertisements for prescription drugs in family practice medical journals published in Australia, Canada and the USA with different regulatory controls: a cross-sectional study.","To assess if different forms of regulation lead to differences in the quality of journal advertisements.Cross-sectional study.Thirty advertisements from family practice journals published from 2013 to 2015 were extracted for three countries with distinct regulatory pharmaceutical promotion systems: Australia, Canada and the USA.Advertisements under each regulatory system were compared concerning three domains: information included in the advertisement, references to scientific evidence and pictorial appeals and portrayals. An overall ranking for advertisement quality among countries was determined using the first two domains as the information assessed has been associated with more appropriate prescribing.Advertisements varied significantly for number of claims with quantitative benefit (Australia: 0.0 (0.0-3.0); Canada: 0.0 (0.0-5.0); USA: 1.0 (0.0-6.0); p=0.01); statistical method used in reporting benefit (relative risk reduction, absolute risk reduction and number needed to treat; Australia: 6.7%, n=2; Canada: 10.0%, n=3; USA: 36.6%, n=11; p=0.02); mention of adverse effects, warnings or contraindications (Australia: 13.3%, n=4; Canada: 23.3%, n=7; USA: 53.3%, n=16; p=0.002); equal prominence between safety and benefit information (Australia: 25.0%, n=1; Canada: 28.6%, n=2; USA: 75.0%, n=12; p=0.04); and methodological quality of references score (Australia: 0.4150 (0.25-0.70); Canada: 0.25 (0.00-0.63); USA: 0.25 (0.00-0.75); p<0.001). The USA ranked first, Canada second and Australia third for overall quality of journal advertisements. Significant differences for humour appeals (Australia: 3.3%, n=1; Canada: 13.3%, n=4; USA: 26.7%, n=8; p=0.04), positive emotional appeals (Australia: 26.7%, n=8; Canada: 60.0%, n=18; USA: 50.0%, n=15; p=0.03), social approval portrayals (Australia: 0.0%, n=0; Canada: 0.0%, n=0; USA: 10.0%, n=3; p=0.04) and lifestyle or work portrayals (Australia: 43.3%, n=13; Canada: 50.0%, n=15; USA: 76.7%, n=23; p=0.02) were found among countries.Different regulatory systems influence journal advertisement quality concerning all measured domains. However, differences may also be attributed to other regulatory, legal, cultural or health system factors unique to each country.","['health policy', 'primary care', 'quality in health care']"
Efficacy of transversus abdominis plane block on postoperative nausea and vomiting: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial.,"Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a common postoperative complication, and Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block can provide effective analgesia for surgical operation. However, but there is not enough evidence to prove its advantage for nausea and vomiting. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of TAP block on PONV.Two independent researchers conducted searches for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. We used Review Manager software for meta-analysis.In this meta-analysis, twenty-six trials with 1981 patients were examined. The results showed that TAP block reduced postoperative nausea (Risk Difference (RD) = -0.10, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.15 to -0.05) compared with no TAP block. TAP block reduced the dose of fentanyl (Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) = -1.17, 95% CI: -2.07 to -0.26) and morphine (SMD = -1.12, 95% CI: -2.10 to -0.13) compared with no TAP block, when the timing of administration was before surgery (RD = -0.13, 95% CI: -0.19 to -0.07). TAP block reduced postoperative nausea when the ropivacaine dosage is ≤ 100 mg (RD = -0.13, 95% CI: -0.21 to -0.06), bupivacaine dosage ≥ 100 mg ( RD = -0.08, 95% CI: -0.13 to -0.03), and when the ropivacaine concentration was ≤ 0.375% (RD = -0.11, 95% CI: -0.18 to -0.04). TAP block significantly reduced the incidence of nausea when the types of opioid drugs in PCA is tramadol (RD = -0.13, 95% CI: -0.24 to -0.03). TAP block could reduce the VAS (SMD= -0.99, 95% CI: -1.29 to -0.70) and reduce the time of extubation (SMD = -0.71, 95% CI: -1.34 to -0.08).The meta-analysis conducted in this study revealed that TAP block could reduce the incidence of PONV, and the efficacy of TAP block may be influenced by factors such as administration time, local anesthetic dosage and concentration, types of opioid drugs in PCA.","['Metaanalysis', 'Nausea', 'Transversus abdominis plane', 'Vomiting']"
COVID-19 Impact on Australian Patients with Substance Use Disorders: Emergency Department Admissions in Western Sydney before Vaccine Roll Out.,"Background: In this study, we determined the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Western Sydney patients with substance use disorders (SUD) by comparing emergency department (ED) admission rates before and after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and before the rollout of COVID-19 vaccination. Methods: ED admission data for patients with SUD were retrieved from the local electronic medical record (eMR) on the hospital central database. ED data collected from 25 January to 25 July 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) were compared with data from 25 January to 25 July 2020 (early pandemic). ED admission reasons were categorised based on the presenting complaints and ED diagnoses. Results: Despite an overall reduction in ED admissions during the early pandemic, compared to the pre-pandemic period, admissions for patients with SUD increased significantly (1.7% to 3.4%, p < 0.01). ED admission rates related to infection (0.05% to 0.12%, p < 0.01), local infection (0.02% to 0.05%, p < 0.01), trauma (0.06% to 0.12%, p < 0.01), alcohol (0.01% to 0.03%, p < 0.05), and other issues (0.06% to 0.10%, p < 0.05) increased significantly among Indigenous patients with SUD. ED admission rates related to drugs (0.12% to 0.39%, p < 0.01), infection (0.21% to 0.34%, p < 0.01), local infection (0.07% to 0.18%, p < 0.01), gastrointestinal (0.15% to 0.23%, p < 0.05), trauma (0.14% to 0.25%, p < 0.01), alcohol (0.36% to 0.74%, p < 0.01), and ‘other’ issues (0.47% to 0.91%, p < 0.01) increased significantly among non-Indigenous patients with SUD. Four cases of COVID-19 were reported among these patients. Conclusions: There was an increase in ED admissions for patients with SUD in the initial six months of the COVID-19 pandemic (before vaccine rollout), mainly for drugs, systemic infection, local infection, trauma, and alcohol-related reasons. Now that most people in New South Wales have been vaccinated against COVID-19, a further study is needed to quantify the effect of the pandemic on patients with SUD in the post-vaccine era.","['COVID19 impact', 'addiction', 'alcohol dependence', 'drug health patient', 'substance use disorder']"
Diagnostic accuracy of anthropometric indices for discriminating elevated blood pressure in pediatric population: a systematic review and a meta-analysis.,"Childhood obesity is more likely to increase the chance of many adult health problems. Numerous studies have shown obese children to be more prone to elevated blood pressure (BP) and hypertension. It is important to identify an obesity anthropometric index with good discriminatory power for them in pediatric population.MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases were retrieved comprehensively for eligible studies on childhood obesity and hypertension/elevated BP through June 2021. The systematic review and meta-analysis of studies used receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves for evaluating the discriminatory power of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) in distinguishing children with elevated BP and hypertension.21 cross-sectional studies involving 177,943 children and 3-19 years of age were included in our study. Meta-analysis showed that the pooled area under the reporting receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for BMI, WC, and WHtR to detect hypertension of boys were 0.68 (0.64, 0.72), 0.69 (0.64, 0.74), 0.67 (0.63, 0.71), for elevated BP, the pooled AUCs and 95% CIs were 0.67 (0.61, 0.73), 0.65 (0.58, 0.73), 0.65 (0.61, 0.71). The pooled AUCs and 95% CIs for BMI, WC and WHtR of predicting hypertension were 0.70 (0.66, 0.75), 0.69 (0.64, 0.75), 0.67 (0.63, 0.72) in girls, the pooled AUCs and 95% CIs of predicting elevated BP were 0.63 (0.61, 0.65), 0.62 (0.60, 0.65), 0.62 (0.60, 0.64) respectively. There was no anthropometric index was statistically superior in identifying hypertension and elevated BP, however, the accuracy of BMI predicting hypertension was significantly higher than elevated BP in girls (P < 0.05). The subgroup analysis for the comparison of BMI, WC and WHtR was performed, no significant difference in predicting hypertension and elevated BP in pediatric population.This systematic review showed that no anthropometric index was superior in identifying hypertension and elevated BP in pediatric population. While compared with predicting elevated BP, all the indicators showed superiority in predicting hypertension in children, the difference was especially obvious in girls. A better anthropometric index should be explored to predict children's early blood pressure abnormalities.","['Body mass index', 'Children and adolescents', 'Elevated blood pressure', 'Waist circumference', 'Waisttoheight ratio']"
Health-related quality of life in asthma patients - A comparison of two cohorts from 2005 and 2015.,"The aim was to investigate temporal variation in Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQL) and factors influencing low HRQL, in patients with asthma.Questionnaire data on patient characteristics and the mini-Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (mini-AQLQ) scores from two separate cohorts of randomly selected Swedish primary and secondary care asthma patients, in 2005 (n = 1034) and 2015 (n = 1126). Student's t-test and analysis of covariance with adjustment for confounders compared mini-AQLQ total and domain scores in 2005 and 2015. Multivariable linear regression analyzed associations with mini-AQLQ scores.The mean Mini-AQLQ scores were unchanged between 2005 and 2015 (adjusted means (95% CI) 2005: 5.39 (5.27-5.33) and in 2015: 5.44 (95% CI 5.32 to 5.38), p = 0.26). Overweight (regression coefficient 95% CI) (0.21 (-0.36 to -0.07)), obesity (-0.34 (-0,50 to -0.18)), one or more exacerbations during the previous six months (-0.64 (-0.79 to -0.50)), self-rated moderate/severe disease (-1.02 (-1.15 to -0.89)), heart disease (-0.42 (-0.68 to -0.16)), anxiety/depression (-0.31 (-0.48 to -0.13)) and rhinitis (-0.25 (-0.42 to -0.08)) were associated with lower HRQL. Higher educational level (0.32 (0.19-0.46)) and self-reported knowledge of self-management of exacerbations (0.35 (0.19-0.51)) were associated with higher HRQL.HRQL in Swedish patients with asthma is generally good and unchanged during the last decade. Overweight, obesity, exacerbations, self-rated moderate/severe disease, heart disease, depression/anxiety and rhinitis were associated with lower HRQL, and high educational level and knowledge on self-management with higher HRQL.","['Asthma', 'Healthrelated quality of life', 'MiniAQLQ', 'Risk factors']"
Processing characteristics of dairy cow milk are moderately heritable.,"Milk processing attributes represent a group of milk quality traits that are important to the dairy industry to inform product portfolio. However, because of the resources required to routinely measure such quality traits, precise genetic parameter estimates from a large population of animals are lacking for these traits. Milk processing characteristics considered in the present study-rennet coagulation time, curd-firming time, curd firmness at 30 and 60 min after rennet addition, heat coagulation time, casein micelle size, and milk pH-were all estimated using mid-infrared spectroscopy prediction equations. Variance components for these traits were estimated using 136,807 test-day records from 5 to 305 d in milk (DIM) from 9,824 cows using random regressions to model the additive genetic and within-lactation permanent environmental variances. Heritability estimates ranged from 0.18 ± 0.01 (26 DIM) to 0.38 ± 0.02 (180 DIM) for rennet coagulation time; from 0.26 ± 0.02 (5 DIM) to 0.57 ± 0.02 (174 DIM) for curd-firming time; from 0.16 ± 0.01 (30 DIM) to 0.56 ± 0.02 (271 DIM) for curd firmness at 30 min; from 0.13 ± 0.01 (30 DIM) to 0.48 ± 0.02 (271 DIM) for curd firmness at 60 min; from 0.08 ± 0.01 (17 DIM) to 0.24 ± 0.01 (180 DIM) for heat coagulation time; from 0.23 ± 0.02 (30 DIM) to 0.43 ± 0.02 (261 DIM) for casein micelle size; and from 0.20 ± 0.01 (30 DIM) to 0.36 ± 0.02 (151 DIM) for milk pH. Within-trait genetic correlations across DIM weakened as the number of days between compared intervals increased but were mostly >0.4 except between the peripheries of the lactation. Eigenvalues and associated eigenfunctions of the additive genetic covariance matrix for all traits revealed that at least the 80% of the genetic variation among animals in lactation profiles was associated with the height of the lactation profile. Curd-firming time and curd firmness at 30 min were weakly to moderately genetically correlated with milk yield (from 0.33 ± 0.05 to 0.59 ± 0.05 for curd-firming time, and from -0.62 ± 0.03 to -0.21 ± 0.06 for curd firmness at 30 min). Milk protein concentration was strongly genetically correlated with curd firmness at 30 min (0.84 ± 0.02 to 0.94 ± 0.01) but only weakly genetically correlated with milk heat coagulation time (-0.27 ± 0.07 to 0.19 ± 0.06). Results from the present study indicate the existence of exploitable genetic variation for milk processing characteristics. Because of possible indirect deterioration in milk processing characteristics due to selection for greater milk yield, emphasis on milk processing characteristics is advised.","['milk coagulation', 'milk quality', 'milk technological', 'random regression', 'spectrometry']"
Soy Protein Supplementation Reduces Clinical Indices in Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome.,"Clinical trials have studied the use of soy protein for treating type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic syndrome (MS). The purpose of this study was to outline evidence on the effects of soy protein supplementation on clinical indices in T2D and MS subjects by performing a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs).We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases up to March 2015 for RCTs. Pooled estimates and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by the fixed-and-random-effects model. A total of eleven studies with eleven clinical variables met the inclusion criteria.The meta-analysis showed that fasting plasma glucose (FPG) [weighted mean difference (WMD), -0.207; 95% CI, -0.374 to -0.040; p=0.015], fasting serum insulin (FSI) (WMD, -0.292; 95% CI, -0.496 to -0.088; p=0.005), homeostasis model of assessment for insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR) (WMD, -0.346; 95% CI, -0.570 to -0.123; p=0.002), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (WMD, -0.230; 95% CI, -0.441 to -0.019; p=0.033), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (WMD, -0.304; 95% CI, -0.461 to -0.148; p=0.000), total cholesterol (TC) (WMD, -0.386; 95% CI, -0.548 to -0.225; p=0.000), and C-reactive protein (CRP) (WMD, -0.510; 95% CI, -0.722 to -0.299; p=0.000) are significant reduced with soy protein supplementation, compared with a placebo control group, in T2D and MS patients. Furthermore, soy protein supplementation for longer duration (≥6 mo) significantly reduced FPG, LDL-C, and CRP, while that for a shorter duration (<6 mo) significantly reduced FSI and HOMA-IR.Soy protein supplementation could be beneficial for FPG, FSI, HOMA-IR, DBP, LDL-C, TC, and CRP control in plasma.","['Soy', 'blood glucose', 'body weight', 'diabetes', 'lipid']"
[Histopathological characteristics of peri-implant soft tissue in reconstructed jaws with vascularized bone flaps].,"To analyze the histopathological characteristics of peri-implant soft tissue in reconstructed jaws and the changes after keratinized mucosa augmentation (KMA) with free gingival graft (FGG).Twenty patients were enrolled in this study. Five patients of them, who were periodontal and systemic healthy and referred for crown lengthening before restoration with healthy keratinized gingiva collected were enrolled as healthy controls. 15 patients of them were with fibula or iliac bone flaps jaw reconstruction (10 with fibula flap and 5 with iliac flap), who were referred to FGG and implant exposures before restoration. Soft tissue was collected before FGG in reconstructed jaws, and in 5 patients (3 with fibula flap and 2 with iliac flap) 8 weeks after FGG if a second surgery was conducted. Histological analysis with hematoxylin-eosin stain and immunological analysis to interlukin-1 (IL-1), interlukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) were performed.Thickness from the bottom of stratum basale to the top of stratum granulosum and thickness of keratinized layer in reconstructed jaws were significantly lower compared with that of natural healthy keratinized gingiva [0.27 (0.20, 0.30) mm <i>vs</i>. 0.36 (0.35, 0.47) mm, <i>P</i><0.05; 16.49 (14.90, 23.37) μm <i>vs</i>. 26.37 (24.12, 31.53) μm, <i>P</i><0.05]. In the reconstructed area, thickness from the bottom of stratum basale to the top of stratum granulosum increased after KMA with FGG [0.19 (0.16, 0.25) mm <i>vs</i>. 0.38 (0.25, 0.39) mm, <i>P</i>=0.059] and the thickness of keratinized layer significantly increased after KMA with FGG [16.42 (14.16, 22.35) μm <i>vs</i>. 28.57 (27.16, 29.14) μm, <i>P</i><0.05], which was similar to that in the control group. Furthermore, the number of positive cells of IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-α significantly increased after KMA [0.67 (0.17, 8.93) <i>vs</i>. 11.00 (9.16, 18.00); 13.00 (8.50, 14.14) <i>vs</i>. 21.89 (15.00, 28.12); 0.22 (0.04, 0.63) <i>vs</i>. 2.83 (1.68, 5.00), respectively, <i>P</i><0.05] as well as the average optical density value [0.15 (0.14, 0.17) <i>vs</i>. 0.18 (0.17, 0.21); 0.28 (0.26, 0.33) <i>vs</i>. 0.36 (0.33, 0.37); 0.23 (0.22, 0.29) <i>vs</i>. 0.30 (0.28, 0.42), respectively, <i>P</i><0.05], which was similar to that in the healthy keratinized gingiva.The lack of rete pegs and inflammatory factors were common in soft tissue with jaw reconstruction. FGG can improve the quality of the epithelium and may improve the stability of the mucosa around implants.","['Free gingival graft', 'Jaw reconstruction', 'Soft tissue', 'Vascularized bone flap']"
Association of electrocardiographic spatial heterogeneity of repolarization and spatial heterogeneity of atrial depolarization with left ventricular fibrosis.,"To evaluate the relationship between spatial heterogeneity of electrocardiographic repolarization and spatial heterogeneity of atrial depolarization with arrhythmic substrate represented by left ventricular fibrosis.We assessed the associations of T- and P-wave morphology parameters analysed from the standard 12-lead electrocardiograms with left ventricular fibrosis in 378 victims of unexpected sudden cardiac death (SCD) who underwent medico-legal autopsy. Based on autopsy findings, the SCD victims were categorized into four different groups according to different stages of severity of left ventricular fibrosis (substantial fibrosis, moderate patchy fibrosis, scattered mild fibrosis, no fibrosis). T-wave and P-wave area dispersion (TWAd: 0.0841 ± 0.496, 0.170 ± 0.492, 0.302 ± 404, 0.296 ± 0.476, P = 0.008; PWAd: 0.574 ± 0.384, 0.561 ± 0.367, 0.654 ± 0.281, 0.717 ± 0.257, P = 0.011, respectively; low values abnormal), non-dipolar components of T-wave and P-wave morphology (T_NonDipolarABS: 0.0496 ± 0.0377, 0.0571 ± 0.0487, 0.0432 ± 0.0476, 0.0380 ± 0.0377, P = 0.027; P_NonDipolarABS: 0.0132 ± 0.0164, 0.0130 ± 0.0135, 0.0092 ± 0.0117, 0.0069 ± 0.00472, P = 0.005, respectively, high values abnormal), T-wave morphology dispersion (TMD: 45.9 ± 28.3, 40.5 ± 25.8, 35.5 ± 24.9, 33.0 ± 24.6, P = 0.030, respectively, high values abnormal), and P-wave heterogeneity (PWH: 20.0 ± 9.44, 19.7 ± 8.87, 17.9 ± 9.78, 15.4 ± 4.60, P = 0.019, respectively, high values abnormal) differed significantly between the groups with different stages of left ventricular fibrosis. After adjustment with heart weight, T_NonDipolarABS [standardized β (sβ) = 0.131, P = 0.014], PWAd (sβ = -0.161, P = 0.003), P_NonDipolarABS (sβ = 0.174, P = 0.001), and PWH (sβ = 0.128, P = 0.015) retained independent association, and TWAd (sβ = -0.091, P = 0.074) and TMD (sβ = 0.097, P = 0.063) tended to retain their association with the degree of myocardial fibrosis.Our findings suggest that abnormal values of T- and P-wave morphology are associated with arrhythmic substrate represented by ventricular fibrosis partly explaining the mechanism behind their prognostic significance.","['Atrial depolarization', 'Electrocardiography', 'Myocardial fibrosis', 'Pwave', 'Pwave morphology', 'Sudden cardiac death', 'Twave', 'Twave morphology', 'Ventricular repolarization']"
Safety and efficacy of insulin glargine 300 u/mL compared with other basal insulin therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a network meta-analysis.,"To compare the efficacy and safety of a concentrated formulation of insulin glargine (Gla-300) with other basal insulin therapies in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).This was a network meta-analysis (NMA) of randomised clinical trials of basal insulin therapy in T2DM identified via a systematic literature review of Cochrane library databases, MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process, EMBASE and PsycINFO.Changes in HbA1c (%) and body weight, and rates of nocturnal and documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia were assessed.41 studies were included; 25 studies comprised the main analysis population: patients on basal insulin-supported oral therapy (BOT). Change in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was comparable between Gla-300 and detemir (difference: -0.08; 95% credible interval (CrI): -0.40 to 0.24), neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH; 0.01; -0.28 to 0.32), degludec (-0.12; -0.42 to 0.20) and premixed insulin (0.26; -0.04 to 0.58). Change in body weight was comparable between Gla-300 and detemir (0.69; -0.31 to 1.71), NPH (-0.76; -1.75 to 0.21) and degludec (-0.63; -1.63 to 0.35), but significantly lower compared with premixed insulin (-1.83; -2.85 to -0.75). Gla-300 was associated with a significantly lower nocturnal hypoglycaemia rate versus NPH (risk ratio: 0.18; 95% CrI: 0.05 to 0.55) and premixed insulin (0.36; 0.14 to 0.94); no significant differences were noted in Gla-300 versus detemir (0.52; 0.19 to 1.36) and degludec (0.66; 0.28 to 1.50). Differences in documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia rates of Gla-300 versus detemir (0.63; 0.19 to 2.00), NPH (0.66; 0.27 to 1.49) and degludec (0.55; 0.23 to 1.34) were not significant. Extensive sensitivity analyses supported the robustness of these findings.NMA comparisons are useful in the absence of direct randomised controlled data. This NMA suggests that Gla-300 is also associated with a significantly lower risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia compared with NPH and premixed insulin, with glycaemic control comparable to available basal insulin comparators.",['DIABETES  ENDOCRINOLOGY']
Effects of vitamin D supplementation on ovulation and pregnancy in women with polycystic ovary syndrome: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To evaluate the effect of vitamin D supplementation on pregnancy and ovulation in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome.We searched Pubmed, Medline (via Ovid, 1974 to 2020), EMBASE (via Ovid, 1974 to 2020), Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (via Ovid), Web of Science, CNKI, WangFang and the Vip database from inception until April 2021. Two researchers independently screened articles, collected data and evaluated the quality, with Review manager 5.3 for meta-analysis.Totally 20 randomized controlled studies with 1961 subjects were included. Meta analysis showed that pregnancy rate [RR=1.44 (1.28, 1.62), p<0.00,001], ovulation rate [RR=1.42 (1.14, 1.78), p=0.002] and matured oocytes rate [RR=1.08 (1.03, 1.13), p=0.002] of vitamin D supplementation group were significantly higher than those of control group. Meanwhile, early miscarriage rate [RR=0.44 (0.30, 0.66), p<0.00,001], androgen level [MD=-2.31 (-3.51, -1.11), p=0.0002], luteinizing hormone [MD=-1.47 (-2.57, -0.36), p=0.009], follicle stimulating hormone [MD=-0.15 (-0.24, -0.05), p=0.002], and premature delivery rate [RR=0.38, 95% CI (0.21, 0.70), p=0.002] were declined significantly than the controls. However, only one article suggested that the progesterone [MD=6.52 (4.52, 8.52), p<0.05] in the vitamin D intervention group was increased. There was no notable difference in the biochemical pregnancy rate [RR=0.95 (0.55, 1.63), p=0.84], gestational hypertension rate [RR=0.40, 95% CI (0.15, 1.11), p=0.08], gestational diabetes mellitus rate [RR=0.27, 95% CI (0.05, 1.39), p=0.11], fertilization rate [RR=1.05 (1.00, 1.10), p=0.04], cleavage rate [RR=1.03 (0.99, 1.06), p=0.17], high-quality embryo rate [RR=1.08 (0.98, 1.20), p=0.10], endometrial thickness [MD=0.10], 77 (-0.23, 1.77), p=0.13], estrogen level [MD=-0.34 (-1.55, 0.87), p=0.59], LH/FSH [MD=-0.14, 95% CI (-0.48, 0.20), p=1.00] and anti-Mullerian hormone [MD=-0.22 (-0.65, 0.21), p=0.32].Vitamin D supplementation contribute to the higher pregnancy and ovulation rates, and lower androgen, LH, FSH and early miscarriage rates in women with PCOS, regardless of the use of ovulation induction drugs or assisted reproductive technologies. However, no significant improvement was observed in fertilization rate or cleavage rate. Due to the limitation in quality of involved studies, more high-quality RCTs are needed for further validation.https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO, identifier CRD42021250284.","['metaanalysis', 'ovulation', 'polycystic ovary syndrome', 'pregnancy', 'vitamin D']"
Association of meteorological factors with paediatric intussusception in Hangzhou: an 8-year retrospective cohort study.,"This study aimed to investigate the seasonality of paediatric intussusception and the associations between meteorological factors and paediatric intussusception in Hangzhou, as well as aimed to compare the variance in sex and disease type.An 8-year retrospective study was conducted from January 2014 to December 2021 in the Children's Hospital of Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China.This was a single-centre retrospective study review of intussusception cases in a large Children's Hospital in Hangzhou.There were 17 674 patients with intussusception in this study.A Spearman correlation analysis and Poisson regression analysis were used to determine the association between weekly intussusception cases and meteorological factors. The seasonality of paediatric intussusception was demonstrated via the t-test and visualised.In January, May and December, there were relatively more intussusception patients. In February, there was a trough in the number of intussusception patients. Both the Spearman correlation analysis and Poisson regression analysis proved that weekly intussusception cases had significant associations with temperature (λ=-0.205, p<0.01; β=-0.080, p<0.01), feels-like temperature (λ=-0.214, p<0.01; β=-0.012, p<0.01), dew (λ=-0.249, p<0.01; β=0.095, p<0.01), humidity (λ=-0.230, p<0.01; β=-0.037, p<0.01), precipitation (λ=-0.148, p<0.01; β=-0.001, p<0.01), windspeed (λ=-0.135, p<0.01; β=0.005, p<0.01), visibility (λ=-0.206, p<0.01; β=-0.066, p<0.01), sea level pressure (λ=0.171, p<0.01; β=-0.004, p<0.01) and a total of 20 of 25 dynamic meteorological factors (p<0.05). These associations reflected gender differences but showed stronger associations in groups that were prone to recurrence.Paediatric intussusception in Hangzhou showed a seasonal tendency. Additionally, intussusception was significantly associated with certain meteorological factors in all of the cases. These findings suggest that parents and paediatricians should be more vigilant about the occurrence of intussusception in children regarding seasonal change times and climate change times.","['epidemiology', 'paediatric AE and ambulatory care', 'paediatric gastroenterology']"
Sex Difference in the Associations among Obesity-Related Indices with Hyperuricemia in a Large Taiwanese Population Study.,"Hyperuricemia has been linked with the development of diabetes, gout, kidney, and cardiovascular diseases. Although obesity is associated with hyperuricemia, data on sex differences in this association are scarce. Therefore, this study was conducted to explore sex differences in the correlations among various indices of obesity with hyperuricemia in Taiwan. Data were obtained from the Taiwan Biobank and included 122,067 participants. After excluding 179 participants with missing data, the remaining 121,888 participants (men: 43,790; women: 78,098) were enrolled. The prevalence rates of hyperuricemia (defined as serum uric acid >7.0/6.0 mg/dL in men/women) were 29.8% and 13.6%, respectively (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Multivariable analysis revealed high values of body shape index (ABSI), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), waist-hip ratio (WHR), lipid accumulation product (LAP), conicity index (CI), visceral adiposity index (VAI), body adiposity index (BAI), abdominal volume index (AVI), body mass index (BMI), and body roundness index (BRI) were significantly associated with hyperuricemia in both the male and female participants (all <i>p</i> < 0.001). The interactions between sex and all 10 of these indices were significant (all <i>p</i> < 0.001) for hyperuricemia. In men, LAP had the highest area under the curve (0.669), followed by BMI (0.655), VAI (0.645), AVI (0.642), BRI (0.640), WHtR (0.633), BAI (0.605), WHR (0.599), CI (0.574), and ABSI (0.510). In women, LAP also had the highest area under the curve (0.754), followed by BMI (0.728), VAI (0.724), WHtR (0.721), BRI (0.720), AVI (0.713), WHR (0.676), BAI (0.673), CI (0.626), and ABSI (0.544). In conclusion, obesity-related indices were associated with hyperuricemia in this large Taiwanese study, and sex differences were found in these associations, with stronger associations in women than in men.","['Taiwan Biobank', 'hyperuricemia', 'lipid accumulation product', 'obesityrelated indices', 'waisttoheight ratio', 'waist–hip ratio']"
Clinicopathological Significance of MTA 1 Expression in Patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A Meta-Analysis.,"Background: Metastasis associated gene 1(MTA1) is one of the most deregulated molecules in human cancer and leads to cancer progression and metastasis. We performed a meta-analysis to determine the correlations between MTA1 expression and the clinicopathological characteristics of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Methods: We searched PubMed, Springer, Science Direct, Google Scholar and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) for relevant articles. For statistical analyses, we used R3.1.1 software. The fixed or random effects model was employed based on the results of the statistical test for homogeneity. Results: Seven studies involving 660 NSCLC patients were included. The proportion of MTA1 overexpression with 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was 0.53(95%CI: 0.43-0.62) in NSCLC patients; 0.47(95%CI: 0.40-0.55) in age <60 years and 0.52(95%CI: 0.34-0.70) in age ≥60 years; 0.5(95%CI: 0.41- 0.62) in males and 0.51(95%CI: 0.39-0.62) in females; 0.59(95%CI: 0.48-0.69) in squamous cell carcinoma (SC) and 0.57(95%CI: 0.46-0.67) in adenocarcinoma (AC); 0.39(95%CI: 0.23-0.56) in well-differentiated tumors, 0.44(95%CI: 0.37-0.51) in moderately differentiated tumors and 0.55(95%CI: 0.37-0.51) in poorly differentiated tumors; 0.48(95%CI: 0.36-0.60) in clinical grade (III-IV) NSCLC and 0.75 (95%CI: 0.69-0.81) in clinical grade (I-II) NSCLC; 0.58(95%CI: 0.45-0.71) in T Stage (T1/T2) NSCLC; 0.68(95%CI: 0.49-0.82) in NSCLC patients with lymph node positivity and 0.51(95%CI: 0.43-0.58) in NSCLC patients with lymph node negativity. Conclusions: These results indicated that MTA1 might be a valuable biomarker in the diagnosis of NSCLC. MTA1 overexpression was significantly associated with age ≥60 years, gender, histopathological type, clinical grade (I-II), T stage (T1/T2) and lymph node positivity in NSCLC patients.","['MTA1', 'NSCLC', 'metaanalysis']"
Differences in Health-Related Quality of Life and Its Associated Factors Among Older Adults in Urban and Rural Areas.,"Urban-rural health disparity is one of the most prominent challenges in China today. The goal of this study is to find differences in health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and its associated factors among older people in urban and rural areas.A multi-stage stratified sampling method was conducted in Shanxi Province, with a total of 3250 older adults participated in this cross-sectional survey. HRQoL was assessed using the Chinese version of the EQ-5D-5L. Tobit regression models were employed to identify associated factors for HRQoL.The mean EQ-5D utility score of the total sample was 0.87± 0.23, with a statistically significant difference observed between urban (0.89 ± 0.22) and rural areas (0.86 ± 0.23). Obesity (<i>Coe</i>=-0.10, <i>p</i>=0.021) and nutrition awareness (<i>Coe</i>=-0.14, <i>p</i>=0.009) were two unique associated factors to rural older adults' HRQoL. While, age (Urban: <i>Coe</i>=0.13, <i>p</i>=0.001; Rural: <i>Coe</i>=-0.019, <i>p</i><0.001), socioeconomic status (Urban: <i>Coe</i>=0.13, <i>p</i><0.001; Rural: <i>Coe</i>=0.14, <i>p</i><0.001), number of chronic non-communicable diseases (Urban: <i>Coe</i>=-0.20, <i>p</i><0.001; Rural: <i>Coe</i>=-0.15, <i>p</i><0.001), sleep quality (Urban: <i>Coe</i>=-0.22, <i>p</i><0.001; Rural: <i>Coe</i>=0.15, <i>p</i><0.001) and daytime sleepiness (Urban: <i>Coe</i>=-0.13, <i>p</i><0.001; Rural: <i>Coe</i>=-0.13, <i>p</i><0.001) were found to be associated with HRQoL regardless of the residential area.This study suggested that rural older adults are facing HRQoL disadvantages compared to those in urban area. Accordingly, more attention should be devoted to rural older adults' HRQoL, particularly to the unique factors like body weight and nutrition awareness. Targeted policies and interventions should be implemented to improve HRQoL and bridge the urban-rural HRQoL gap.","['HRQoL', 'health management', 'healthrelated quality of life', 'older adults', 'urban and rural']"
The Relationship Between Bronchial Patency and Parameters of ECG Supraventricular Component in Children With Bronchial Asthma.,"<b>Background:</b> Uncontrolled asthma (BA) can be complicated by cardiac conduction disturbances and arrhythmias. It is typical mainly for adult asthmatics patients. In asthmatics children the effect of bronchoconstriction on cardiac conduction, including the supraventricular component of the ECG, is currently under discussion. The objective of the research is to analyze ECG parameters of the atrial complex and atrioventricular conduction and to assess their relationship with spirometric indicators in children with BA. <b>Methods:</b> Hundred three patients with BA from the age of 6-17 years were examined. The spirometric parameters were evaluated, including the Tiffeneau index (TI): FEV1/FVC (%), according to the level of which the patient groups were distinguished. Group 1 (G1): with TI more than 85%, (<i>n</i> = 15); Group 2 (G2): with TI from 85 to 75%, (<i>n</i> = 40); Group 3 (G3): with TI <75%, (<i>n</i> = 48). The ECG parameters that characterize supraventricular conduction, including the PQ interval (sec) and the sPQ segment (sec), were analyzed. We had calculated relative PQ (rPQ) by the formula rPQ=PQ/PQmed, where PQ is the patient's PQ, PQmed are the median PQ values of healthy children of age selected. <b>Results:</b> The duration of the PQ in groups G1 and G2 was 0.13 (0.11; 0.14) s; and 0.13 (0.12; 0.14) s, respectively, which is statistically significantly less than in patients of groups G3-0.14 (0.13; 0.15] s, <i>p</i> = 0.01. The duration of the sPQ segment in children of groups G1 and G2 was also generally shorter than in patients of groups G3, and amounted, respectively, to 0.05 (0.04; 0.06) s, 0.04 (0.04; 0.05) s, and 0.06 (0.04; 0.07) s, <i>p</i> = 0.02. The rPQ increased progressively as TI decreased and amounted in G1 to 92.9 (85.7; 106.3) %, in G2 100.0 (92.9; 103.0) %, and in G3 104 (100.0; 107.7) %, <i>p</i> = 0.009. A statistically significant negative correlation between IT and PQ-<i>r</i> = -0.23, <i>p</i> = 0.02; with sPQ-r = -0.20, <i>p</i> = 0.045; and with rPQ-<i>r</i> = -0.25, <i>p</i> = 0.01 was revealed. <b>Conclusion:</b> A decrease in TI in asthmatics children is associated with a prolongation of the PQ. This may indicate a slowdown in supraventricular conduction in patients with uncontrolled asthma and, thus, be considered as a risk for the formation of subsequent supraventricular arrhythmias.","['ECG', 'bronchial asthma', 'bronchial patency', 'children', 'supraventricular component']"
Genetic analysis of disease resilience in wean-to-finish pigs from a natural disease challenge model.,"The objective was to estimate the genetic parameters of performance and resilience of growing pigs under disease. Data were from 3,139 Yorkshire × Landrace wean-to-finish pigs that were exposed to a natural polymicrobial disease challenge that was established by entering naturally infected animals into a nursery barn, targeting various viral and bacterial diseases. The challenge was maintained by entering batches of 60 or 75 healthy nursery pigs every 3 wk in a continuous flow system. Traits analyzed included average daily gain (ADG), feed intake (ADFI) and duration (ADFD); feed conversion ratio (FCR); residual feed intake (RFI); mortality (MOR); number of health treatments (TRT); health scores (HScore); carcass weight (CWT), back fat (CBF) and loin depth (CLD); dressing percentage (DRS); lean yield (LYLD); day-to-day variation in feed intake and duration (VARFI and VARDUR); and the proportion of off-feed days (OFFFI and OFFDUR). Analyses were performed by mixed linear models with genomic relationships. The resilience traits, such as TRT, MOR, and HScore, were lowly heritable (up to 0.15) but had high genetic correlations with each other. Performance traits, such as ADG, ADFI, ADFD, FCR, RFI, and carcass traits, were moderate to highly heritable (0.17 to 0.49). Heritabilities of resilience indicator traits such as OFF and VAR had low to moderate heritabilities (0.08 to 0.23) but were higher when based on duration vs. amount. ADFI had a low genetic correlation with ADFD (0.13). ADG in the challenge nursery had stronger negative genetic correlations with both TRT and MOR than ADG in the finisher (-0.37 to -0.74 vs. -0.15 to -0.56). ADFI and FCR had moderate negative (-0.21 to -0.39) and positive (0.34 to 0.49) genetic correlations, respectively, with TRT and MOR. ADFD and RFI had very low genetic correlations with TRT and MOR. CWT and DRS were moderately negatively correlated with TRT and MOR (-0.33 to -0.59). Resilience indicator traits based on feed intake or duration had moderate to high positive genetic correlations with TRT (0.18 to 0.81) and MOR (0.33 to 0.87). In conclusion, performance and resilience traits under a polymicrobial disease challenge are heritable and can be changed by selection. Phenotypes extracted from feed intake patterns can be used as genetic indicator traits for disease resilience. Most promising is day-to-day variation in intake duration, which had a sizeable heritability (0.23) and favorable genetic correlations with MOR (0.79) and treatment rate (0.20).","['disease resilience', 'genetic parameters', 'natural disease challenge', 'pigs']"
Sense of Coherence and Stress-Related Resilience: Investigating the Mediating and Moderating Mechanisms in the Development of Resilience Following Stress or Adversity.,"<b>Background:</b> Trauma, stress, and adversity are well-known for having lasting negative effects on health. Yet, not all individuals go on to develop psychopathology or impaired health. However, little is known about the underlying mechanisms which influence the development of stress-related resilience. Sense of coherence-revised (SOC-R) may play a role in this process, as it is formed through overcoming stress or adversity. It may also influence the steeling effect, which suggests that previous exposure to moderate adversity increases resilience to later adversities. <b>Objectives:</b> This study aimed to examine the mediating and moderating roles of SOC-R in the relationship between stress or adversity, and psychological health and well-being. It further aimed to investigate the role of SOC-R in steeling processes. <b>Methods:</b> The study used a longitudinal design, with data collection at baseline and one-year follow-up. Participants included (<i>N</i> = 238) Swiss older adults (<i>M</i><sub>age</sub> = 68.3 years). Standardized questionnaires assessed early-life adversity, recent chronic stress, SOC-R, and current health and well-being. Mediation and moderation analyses examined the mechanisms underpinning stress-related resilience and curvilinear associations assessed steeling. <b>Results:</b> Results showed that the Manageability subscale of SOC-R significantly moderated the relationship between chronic stress and general mental health (<i>b</i> = 0.04, 95% CI [0.007, 0.082], <i>t</i> = 2.32, <i>p</i> < 0.05). Furthermore, SOC-R significantly mediated the relationship for general mental health (GMH) and satisfaction with life (SWL) with childhood emotional neglect (GMH: <i>b</i> = -0.056, 95% BCa CI [-0.126, -0.002]; SWL: <i>b</i> = -0.043, 95% BCa CI [-0.088, -0.004]), childhood physical neglect (GMH: <i>b</i> = -0.100, 95% BCa CI [-0.232, -0.002]; SWL: <i>b</i> = -0.081, 95% BCa CI [-0.181, -0.002]), and chronic stress (GMH: <i>b</i> = -0.052, 95% BCa CI [-0.100, -0.001]; SWL: <i>b</i> = -0.055, 95% BCa CI [-0.097, -0.020]). No curvilinear associations were observed between stress or adversity and SOC-R. <b>Conclusions:</b> This study expands on the limited research on stress-related resilience by examining the role of SOC-R in the interactions between adversity, stress, and health. Future research should examine SOC-R in samples with a greater range and different types of adversity. Overall, findings suggest that SOC-R is an important mechanism underpinning the development of stress-related resilience.","['mediating factor', 'psychological health', 'resilience mechanisms', 'sense of coherencerevised', 'stressrelated resilience']"
Correlation of Serum Lipid P rofile with Histological and Seminal Parameters of Testis in The Goat.,"The lipid composition of a mammal's spermatozoa and seminal plasma vary in both structure and function. Evidence exists to suggest that dietary supplementation with the appropriate polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) affects spermatogenesis, semen quality and sperm motility. Therefore, this study has been conducted to evaluate the correlations between serum lipid profile and histological, anatomical and seminal parameters of testes in clinically healthy goats.In this analytic, cross-sectional study, we chose a total of ten mature Iranian male goats that comprised a homogenous group through simple random sampling. Blood samples were taken from the jugular vein; the sera were separated and subsequently used for measurement of serum lipids, lipoproteins and testosterone levels. In addition, we collected semen from the animals and evaluated the seminal characteristics. We also performed histological and anatomical assessments of the testes.The findings demonstrated that serum levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL-c) had a significant positive correlation with interstitial testicular tissue area (r=0.73; p<0.001), seminiferous tubule area (r=0.61; p<0.01), the number of Leydig cells (r=0.53; p<0.05), the diameter of the Leydig cell nuclei (r=0.54; p<0.05), scrotal circumference (r=0.83; p<0.001), testis weight (r=0.72; p<0.001), the number of live, normal sperm (r=0.94 ; p<0.001) and serum testosterone levels (r=0.88; p<0.001). Significant but negative correlations were found between serum triglyceride concentration and seminiferous tubule area (r=-0.53; p<0.05), the diameter of the Leydig cell nuclei (r=-0.55; p<0.05), testis weight (r =-0.64; p<0.01), total sperm number (r=-0.82; p<0.001), number of live, normal sperm (r=-0.55; p<0.05) and serum testosterone levels (r=-0.79; p<0.001). In addition, a significant negative correlation was observed between serum very low density lipoprotein (VLDL-c) concentration and the percent of live sperm (r=-0.67; p<0.01), and serum testosterone levels (r=-0.65; p<0.01).The present results indicated that among serum lipids only the levels of HDL-c positively correlated with testicular parameters. High serum triglyceride levels exerted direct adverse effects at the testicular level, which was mainly observed in the seminiferous tubules (STs), characterization of Leydig cells and semen quality.","['Goat', 'Histology', 'Lipid', 'Testis']"
Effects of three modes of physical activity on physical fitness and hematological parameters in older people with sarcopenic obesity: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"<b>Objective:</b> This systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the effects of three modes of physical activity (PA) (aerobic training [AT], resistance training [RT], and aerobic combined with resistance training [MT]) on body composition (body weight [BW], body mass index [BMI] and percentage of body fat [BF%]), muscle mass (skeletal muscle mass [SM], appendicular skeletal muscle mass [ASM] and appendicular skeletal muscle mass index [ASMI]), muscle strength (handgrip strength [HG] and knee extension strength [KES]), physical performance (gait speed [GS]) and hematological parameters (inflammatory markers, insulin-like growth factor 1 [IGF-1] and lipid profiles) in older people with sarcopenic obesity (SO). <b>Methods:</b> We searched all studies for PA effects in older people with SO from six databases published from January 2010 to November 2021. Two researchers independently screened studies, extracted data according to inclusion and exclusion criteria, and assessed the quality of included studies. Pooled analyses for pre-and post- outcome measures were performed by Review Manager 5.4. We calculated a meta-analysis with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) and the standardized mean differences (SMD). <b>Results:</b> 12 studies were analyzed. There were 614 older people (84.9% female) with SO, aged 58.4 to 88.4 years. Compared with a no-PA control group, AT decreased BW (SMD = -0.64, 95% CI: -1.13 to -0.16, <i>p</i> = 0.009, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 0%) and BMI (SMD = -0.69, 95% CI: -1.18 to -0.21, <i>p</i> = 0.005, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 0%); RT improved BF% (SMD = -0.43, 95% CI: -0.63 to -0.22, <i>p</i> < 0.0001, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 38%), ASMI (SMD = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.24 to 1.21, <i>p</i> = 0.004, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 0%), ASM (SMD = -0.94, 95% CI: -1.46 to -0.42, <i>p</i> = 0.0004), HG (SMD = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.22 to 1.91, <i>p</i> = 0.01, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 90%) and KES (SMD = 1.06, 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.39, <i>p</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 14%); MT improved BMI (SMD = -0.77, 95% CI: -1.26 to -0.28, <i>p</i> = 0.002, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 0%), BF% (SMD = -0.54, 95% CI: -0.83 to -0.25, <i>p</i> = 0.0003, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 0%), ASMI (SMD = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.22 to 1.19, <i>p</i> = 0.005, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 0%) and GS (SMD = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.23 to 1.18, <i>p</i> = 0.004, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 37%). PA increased IGF-1 (SMD = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.11 to 0.66, <i>p</i> = 0.006, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 0%), but had no effect on inflammatory markers and lipid profiles. <b>Conclusion:</b> PA is an effective treatment to improve body composition, muscle mass, muscle strength, physical performance, and IGF-1 in older people with SO.","['body composition', 'exercise', 'inflammation', 'insulinlike growth factor 1', 'lipids profiles', 'muscle mass', 'muscle strength', 'physical performance']"
Ultrasonography Combined With Contrast-enhanced Ultrasonography Can Predict Lymphocyte-predominant Breast Cancer.,"We investigated whether contrast-enhanced ultrasonography (CEUS) scores can predict lymphocyte-predominant breast cancer (LPBC).We evaluated 75 patients who underwent US and CEUS. LPBC was defined as tissues with ≥50% stromal tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) preoperatively. Characteristic US images predicting LPBC were evaluated using TIL-US scores via three ultrasonic tissue characteristics: Shape, internal echo level, and posterior echoes. TIL-CEUS was evaluated based on TIL-US plus CEUS.TIL-US and TIL-CEUS cut-offs for predicting LPBC were 4 and 6 (area under the curve=0.93 and 0.96, respectively) points based on receiver operating characteristics curves. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy values (95% confidence intervaI) were 0.94 (0.77-0.99), 0.75 (0.70-0.77), and 0.80 (0.72-0.82); and 0.94 (0.78-0.99), 0.86 (0.81-0.87), and 0.88 (0.80-0.90) for TIL-US and TIL-CEUS, respectively. TIL-CEUS score was a significant single predictor for LPBC in multivariate logistic regression (p=0.001).TIL-CEUS can be used for preoperative LPBC prediction and detection.","['Breast cancer', 'ascending slope', 'contrastenhanced ultrasound', 'lymphocytepredominant breast cancer', 'tumourinfiltrating lymphocytes', 'ultrasonography']"
Prevalence of insomnia and its relationship to the health habits or status of women living along a city road part 1. epidemiologie study.,"The prevalence rate of insomnia among 424 married women and its associated factors were surveyed. Insomnia is defined as having one of the following symptoms one or more times per week: difficulty inducing sleep (Fl), difficulty maintaining sleep (F2), early morning awakening (F3), light sleep (F4), or worry about poor sleep quality (F5). Poor sleep as a whole in the past one month (F6) was also inquired about. Percentages of Fl, F2, F3 and F5 among the subjects in their sixties were 21.3%, 13.3%, 6.7% and 10.7%, respectively, relatively higher than those of subjects in their thirties or forties. There was a significant difference in the percentage of F6 among four age categories (p < 0.05), and the percentage of F6 was highest (23.3%) in those in their thirties. Depressive state correlated with six insomnia items, Fl to F6 (rs.=-0.195, -0.161, -0.117,-0.221, -0.176, 0.284, respectively). Perceived health status correlated with Fl (-0.237), F4 (-0.213), F5 (-0.259), and F6 (0.373). Present medical condition correlated with Fl (-0.195), F3 (-0.146), and F5 (-0.220). The prevalence rates of insomnia for subjects in their thirties, forties, fifties and sixties were 16.7%, 17.7%, 25.7%, and 24.0%, respectively. Increases in the percentages of difficulty in inducting and maintaining sleep, early morning awakening and worry about poor sleep quality in the subjects in their sixties, and sleep dissatisfaction of those in their thirties were recognized.","['Aging', 'Depressive state', 'Field survey', 'Insomnia', 'Subjective sleep inventory']"
Advances in Transepithelial Photorefractive Keratectomy versus Laser-Assisted In Situ Keratomileusis.,"(1) Background: Laser-assisted refractive surgery is a safe and effective surgical correction of refractive error. For most patients, both the newer Trans-PRK and the established LASIK technique can produce the required surgical correction, sparking the question of which technique should be opted for. (2) Methods: The study prospectively evaluated 121 patients (230 eyes) for at least one month postoperatively; 66 patients (126 eyes) and 45 patients (85 eyes) returned for 6 months and 1 year follow-up. (3) Results: No statistical difference was recorded at 1 week or 1 month post-operation. At 6 months, a difference was found for spherical diopters (Trans-PRK -0.0476 ± 0.7012 versus FS-LASIK +0.425 ± 0.874, <i>p</i> = 0.004) and spherical equivalent (Trans-PRK -0.1994 ± 0.0294 versus FS-LASIK +0.225 ± 0.646, <i>p</i> = 0.025) but not for CYL D (Trans-PRK -0.3036 ± 0.5251 versus FS-LASIK -0.4 ± 0.820, <i>p</i> = 0.499). Uncorrected visual acuity was better for Trans-PRK 6 months post-operation (UCVA logMAR 0.02523 versus 0.0768 logMAR; <i>p</i> = 0.015 logMAR). At 1-year, Trans-PRK was favored for spherical diopters (Trans-PRK -0.0294 ± 0.6493 versus FS-LASIK +0.646 ± 0.909, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and spherical equivalent (Trans-PRK -0.218 ± 0.784 versus FS-LASIK 0.372 ± 1.08, <i>p</i> = 0.007). Overall speed in visual recovery, variance of results and surgically induced astigmatism were in favor of Trans-PRK. (4) Conclusions: The study reported improvements for Trans-PRK patients, with both techniques found to be safe and effective.","['LASIK', 'TransPRK', 'transepithelial photorefractive keratomileusis', 'versus']"
The short-term physiological impact of switching reusable silicone hydrogel wearers into a hydrogel daily disposable multifocal.,"<b>Purpose:</b> To evaluate ocular physiological responses to etafilcon A multifocal (etMF) daily disposable (DD) lenses after 4 weeks of wear, when switching from habitual silicone hydrogel (SiHy) daily wear. <b>Method:</b> A single-arm, open-label, bilateral dispensing study was conducted in 39 habitual spherical SiHy wearers (14 hyperopes; 25 myopes). Clinical visits occurred with habitual SiHy (control) at baseline and after 4 weeks of etMF DD open-eye lens wear at exit. Objective limbal/bulbar hyperemia using the Oculus K5M (0-4) and subjective grading of lid wiper epitheliopathy (LWE) (0-4) were tested for non-inferiority (NI), using a margin of 1 grade. Corneal thickness along a 10 mm cord was measured using the Visante OCT and tested for NI using a 30 μm margin. Corneal staining area was graded (0-100%). <b>Results:</b> The least-square mean differences (LSMD) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) between etMF DD and habitual SiHy in central and peripheral corneal thickness (μm) were 3.64 (-2.0, 9.29) and 3.0 (-7.72, 13.72) in hyperopic, and 3.56 (-0.66, 7.78) and 6.40 (-1.62, 14.42) in myopic subjects. The LSMD (95% CI) for bulbar and limbal hyperemia were -0.08 (-0.19, 0.02) and -0.01 (-0.12, 0.09) in hyperopes, and 0.04 (-0.03, 0.12) and 0.04 (-0.04, 0.11) in myopes. The LSMD (95% CI) for LWE were 0.11 (-0.39, 0.60) and 0.30 (-0.07, 0.67) for hyperopes and myopes, respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> No clinically significant differences in a variety of physiological responses were found when habitual reusable SiHy daily wear subjects were refitted into hydrogel etMF, when the subjects were followed for 4 weeks.","['OCT', 'corneal swelling', 'corneal thickness', 'limbal hyperemia', 'oxygen transmissibility', 'presbyopia']"
The Association of Each Disability Based on the Three Sub-Categories of the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire during Hospitalization with Itself at 1 Year Postoperatively in Patients with Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Stenosis.,"A prospective study in a hospital.To investigate whether each disability based on the three sub-categories of the Roland-Morris disability questionnaire (RDQ) during hospitalization is associated with itself at 1 year postoperatively in patients with degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (LSS).Although the total score of the RDQ represents whole pain-related disabilities or health-related quality of life, it is a shortcoming that multi-dimensional changes in disabilities are difficult to understand when only using the RDQ.Fifty-seven patients with LSS (men, 28; women, 29; 63.0±12.1 years) were included. Disabilities, pain intensity and depressive feelings were assessed at preoperation, discharge and 1 year postoperatively.The range of ""mental and physical activities (MPA),"" ""functional movements on/around a bed (FM)"" and ""walking function (WF)"" scores were 0 to 13 (median, 8), 0 to 6 (median, 6) and 0 to 4 (median, 3) at preoperation; 0 to 12 (median, 0), 0 to 6 (median, 0), and 0 to 4 (median, 0) at discharge; and 0 to 8 (median, 0), 0 to 5 (median, 0), and 0 to 4 (median, 0) at 1 year postoperatively, respectively. The following significant multiple regression equations were obtained: MPA at 1 year postoperatively=0.56 (MPA at discharge)-0.10 (depression at discharge)+0.90 (adjusted r (2)=0.41), FM at 1 year postoperatively=0.35 (MPA at discharge)-0.06 (depression at discharge)+0.40 (adjusted r (2)=0.45) and WF at 1 year postoperatively=0.59 (WF at discharge)-0.08 (depression at discharge)+0.63 (adjusted r (2)=0.29).In our LSS population, each disability based on MPA and WF at discharge is associated with itself in the future. Therefore, disabilities excluding functional movements are longitudinally independent.","['Activities of daily living', 'Lumbar vertebrae', 'RolandMorris disability questionnaire', 'Spinal stenosis']"
"Effect of EPA on Neonatal Pig Sertoli Cells ""<i>In Vitro</i>"": A Possible Treatment to Help Maintain Fertility in Pre-Pubertal Boys Undergoing Treatment With Gonado-Toxic Therapies.","The incidence of cancer in pre-pubertal boys has significantly increased and, it has been recognized that the gonado-toxic effect of the cancer treatments may lead to infertility. Here, we have evaluated the effects on porcine neonatal Sertoli cells (SCs) of three commonly used chemotherapy drugs; cisplatin, 4-Hydroperoxycyclophosphamide and doxorubicin. All three drugs induced a statistical reduction of 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in comparison with the control group, performed by Immunofluorescence Analysis. The gene and protein expression levels of GDNF, were significantly down-regulated after treatment to all three chemotherapy drugs comparison with the control group. Specifically, differences in the mRNA levels of GDNF were: 0,8200 ± 0,0440, 0,6400 ± 0,0140, 0,4400 ± 0,0130 fold change at 0.33, 1.66, and 3.33μM cisplatin concentrations, respectively (**p < 0.01 at 0.33 and 1.66 μM <i>vs</i> SCs and ***p < 0.001 at 3.33μM <i>vs</i> SCs); 0,6000 ± 0,0340, 0,4200 ± 0,0130 fold change at 50 and 100 μM of 4-Hydroperoxycyclophosphamide concentrations, respectively (**p < 0.01 at both these concentrations <i>vs</i> SCs); 0,7000 ± 0,0340, 0,6200 ± 0,0240, 0,4000 ± 0,0230 fold change at 0.1, 0.2 and 1 µM doxorubicin concentrations, respectively (**p < 0.01 at 0.1 and 0.2 μM <i>vs</i> SCs and ***p < 0.001 at 1 μM <i>vs</i> SCs). Differences in the protein expression levels of GDNF were: 0,7400 ± 0,0340, 0,2000 ± 0,0240, 0,0400 ± 0,0230 A.U. at 0.33, 1.66, and 3.33μM cisplatin concentrations, respectively (**p < 0.01 at both these concentrations <i>vs</i> SCs); 0,7300 ± 0,0340, 0,4000 ± 0,0130 A.U. at 50 and 100 μM of 4- Hydroperoxycyclophosphamide concentrations, respectively (**p < 0.01 at both these concentrations <i>vs</i> SCs); 0,6200 ± 0,0340, 0,4000 ± 0,0240, 0,3800 ± 0,0230 A.U. at 0.l, 0.2 and 1 µM doxorubicin concentrations, respectively (**p < 0.01 at 0.1 and 0.2 μM <i>vs</i> SCs and ***p < 0.001 at 1 μM <i>vs</i> SCs). Furthermore, we have demonstrated the protective effect of eicosapentaenoic acid on SCs only at the highest concentration of cisplatin, resulting in an increase in both gene and protein expression levels of GDNF (1,3400 ± 0,0280 fold change; **p < 0.01 <i>vs</i> SCs); and of AMH and inhibin B that were significantly recovered with values comparable to the control group.

Effects of travoprost in the treatment of open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"A 2005 meta-analysis suggests that lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with ocular hypertension (OHT) or open-angle glaucoma (OAG) is beneficial in reducing the risk for visual field loss in the long term.The aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the efficacy and toler-ability of travoprost and latanoprost in patients with OAG or OHT.Pertinent studies published from 1996 to 2008 were identified using systematic searches of major literature databases, including the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Chinese Biomedicine Database. Internet searches of major search engines, professional associations' Web sites, and manufacturers' databases were also performed. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the effects of travoprost 0.004% and latanoprost 0.005% in patients with OAG or OHT were selected. The primary efficacy measure was the weighted mean difference (WMD) in the IOP reduction (IOPR). The primary tolerability measure was the relative risk (RR) for adverse events. The pooled effects were calculated using the random-effects model.Seventeen studies (1491 patients) were included in the meta-analysis, 4 of which were of poor quality based on Jadad scoring. Travoprost was associated with significantly greater diurnal mean IOPRs compared with latanoprost at 2 weeks and 2 months (WMDs [95% CI] mm Hg: 2 weeks, 1.47 [0.33 to 2.62]; 2 months, 0.71 [0.04 to 1.38]); these values were not significant at 1 (0.81 [-0.78 to 2.40]), 3 (0.01 [-0.50 to 0.52]), and 6 months (0.27 [-0.40 to 0.95]). When the 4 studies of low quality were excluded, no significant treatment differences in diurnal IOPR were found. IOPR measured at 5 pm was significantly greater with travoprost compared with latanoprost at 2 weeks (WMD [95% CI], 0.87 mm Hg [0.40 to 1.33]); these values were not significant at 1 (WMD [95% CI], 0.60 mm Hg [0.00 to 1.20], 2 (0.65 [-0.69 to 1.99]), 3 (0.04 [-0.51 to 0.59]), 6 (0.00 [-0.68 to 0.68]), and 12 months (0.30 [-0.36 to 0.96]). Travoprost was associated with a significantly greater frequency of hyperemia than was latanoprost (RR = 1.72 [95% CI, 1.33 to 2.23]). Rates of serious ocular adverse events did not differ significantly between travoprost and latanoprost (cystoid macular edema: RR = 0.22 [95% CI, 0.03 to 1.76]; cataract: RR = 2.29 [95% CI, 0.90 to 5.83]).The findings from the present meta-analysis of these 17 RCTs suggest that there were no significant differences between travoprost and latanoprost in IOPR in these patients with OHT or OAG. Both agents were generally well tolerated.","['intraocular pressure', 'latanoprost', 'metaanalysis', 'travoprost']"
Effects of anesthesia on long-term survival in cancer surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The association between anesthesia and long-term oncological outcome after cancer surgery remains controversial. This study aimed to investigate the effect of propofol-based anesthesia and inhalation anesthesia on long-term survival in cancer surgery.A comprehensive literature search was performed in PubMed, Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library until November 15, 2023. The outcomes included overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). The hazard ratio (HR) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated with a random-effects model.We included forty-two retrospective cohort studies and two randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 686,923 patients. Propofol-based anesthesia was associated with improved OS (HR = 0.82, 95 % CI:0.76-0.88, P < 0.00001) and RFS (HR = 0.80, 95 % CI:0.73-0.88, P < 0.00001) than inhalation anesthesia after cancer surgery. However, these positive results were only observed in single-center studies (OS: HR = 0.76, 95 % CI:0.68-0.84, P < 0.00001; RFS: HR = 0.76, 95 % CI:0.66-0.87, P < 0.0001), but not in multicenter studies (OS: HR = 0.98, 95 % CI:0.94-1.03, P = 0.51; RFS: HR = 0.95, 95 % CI:0.87-1.04, P = 0.26). The subgroup analysis revealed that propofol-based anesthesia provided OS and RFS advantages in hepatobiliary cancer (OS: HR = 0.58, 95 % CI:0.40-0.86, P = 0.005; RFS: HR = 0.62, 95 % CI:0.44-0.86, P = 0.005), gynecological cancer (OS: HR = 0.52, 95 % CI:0.33-0.81, P = 0.004; RFS: HR = 0.51, 95 % CI:0.36-0.72, P = 0.0001), and osteosarcoma (OS: HR = 0.30, 95 % CI:0.11-0.81, P = 0.02; RFS: HR = 0.32, 95 % CI:0.14-0.75, P = 0.008) surgeries.Propofol-based anesthesia may be associated with improved OS and RFS than inhalation anesthesia in some cancer surgeries. Considering the inherent weaknesses of retrospective designs and the strong publication bias, our findings should be interpreted with caution. Well-designed multicenter RCTs are still urgent to further confirm these findings.","['Cancer surgery', 'Inhalation anesthesia', 'Intravenous anesthesia', 'Longterm survival', 'Metaanalysis']"
Leveraging Deep Learning Decision-Support System in Specialized Oncology Center: A Multi-Reader Retrospective Study on Detection of Pulmonary Lesions in Chest X-ray Images.,"Chest X-ray (CXR) is considered to be the most widely used modality for detecting and monitoring various thoracic findings, including lung carcinoma and other pulmonary lesions. However, X-ray imaging shows particular limitations when detecting primary and secondary tumors and is prone to reading errors due to limited resolution and disagreement between radiologists. To address these issues, we developed a deep-learning-based automatic detection algorithm (DLAD) to automatically detect and localize suspicious lesions on CXRs. Five radiologists were invited to retrospectively evaluate 300 CXR images from a specialized oncology center, and the performance of individual radiologists was subsequently compared with that of DLAD. The proposed DLAD achieved significantly higher sensitivity (0.910 (0.854-0.966)) than that of all assessed radiologists (RAD 10.290 (0.201-0.379), <i>p</i> < 0.001, RAD 20.450 (0.352-0.548), <i>p</i> < 0.001, RAD 30.670 (0.578-0.762), <i>p</i> < 0.001, RAD 40.810 (0.733-0.887), <i>p</i> = 0.025, RAD 50.700 (0.610-0.790), <i>p</i> < 0.001). The DLAD specificity (0.775 (0.717-0.833)) was significantly lower than for all assessed radiologists (RAD 11.000 (0.984-1.000), <i>p</i> < 0.001, RAD 20.970 (0.946-1.000), <i>p</i> < 0.001, RAD 30.980 (0.961-1.000), <i>p</i> < 0.001, RAD 40.975 (0.953-0.997), <i>p</i> < 0.001, RAD 50.995 (0.985-1.000), <i>p</i> < 0.001). The study results demonstrate that the proposed DLAD could be utilized as a decision-support system to reduce radiologists' false negative rate.","['YOLO', 'computeraided diagnosis', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'lung cancer', 'object detection', 'pulmonary lesion']"
"The L-enantiomer of β- aminobutyric acid (L-BAIBA) as a potential marker of bone mineral density, body mass index, while D-BAIBA of physical performance and age.","As both L- and D-BAIBA are increased with exercise, we sought to determine if circulating levels would be associated with physical performance.Serum levels of L- and D-BAIBA were quantified in 120 individuals (50% female) aged 20-85 years and categorized as either a ""low"" (LP), ""average""(AP) or ""high"" performer (HP).Association analysis was performed using Spearman (S) and Pearson (P) rank correlation.Using the Spearman (S) rank correlation, L-BAIBA positively associated with BMI (0.23) and total fat mass (0.19) in the 120 participants, with total fat mass in the 60 males (0.26) but with both BMI (0.26) and BMD (0.28) in the 60 females. In the HP females, L-BAIBA positively associated with BMD (0.50) and lean mass (0.47).Using the Pearson (P) rank correlation D-BAIBA was positively associated with age (0.20) in the 120 participants and in the LP females (0.49). D-BAIBA associated with gait speed (S 0.20) in the 120 participants. In HP males, this enantiomer had a negative association with appendicular lean/height (S -0.52) and in the AP males with BMD (S -0.47). No associations were observed in HP or AP females, whereas, in LP females, in addition to a positive association with age, a positive association was observed with grip strength (S 0.45), but a negative with BMD (P -0.52, S -0.63) and chair stands (P -0.47, S -0.51).L-BAIBA may play a role in BMI and BMD in females, not males, whereas D-BAIBA may be a marker for aging.","['biomarkers', 'muscle', 'physical performance']"
The association between meaning in life and harmful drinking is mediated by individual differences in self-control and alcohol value.,"The adoption of adult roles that provide meaning in life is associated with reduced harmful drinking. The current study examined whether this relationship is mediated by increased self-control and reduced value of alcohol.Cross-sectional design. 1043 adults (786 females) ≥18 years old completed an online survey. The outcome variable was scores on the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), predictor variables were presence of and search for meaning in life (Meaning in Life Questionnaire), and mediating variables were trait self-control (Brief Self-Control Scale) and the value of alcohol (Brief Assessment of Alcohol Demand).Presence of meaning in life had a significant negative association (<i>B</i> = -0.01, SE = 0.00, 95% CI -0.02 to -0.00, <i>p</i> = .015), whilst search for meaning in life had a significant positive association (<i>B</i> = 0.01, SE = 0.00, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.02, <i>p</i> = .001) with AUDIT scores. The negative association was mediated by increased self-control (<i>B</i> = -0.09, SE = 0.01, 95% CI -0.12 to -0.06) and decreased value of alcohol (<i>B</i> = -0.02, SE = 0.01, 95% CI -0.04 to 0.00), whilst the positive association was mediated by decreased self-control (<i>B</i> = 0.05, SE = 0.01, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.07) and increased value of alcohol (<i>B</i> = 0.02, SE = 0.01, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.04), thereby supporting our hypotheses.The relationships between presence and search for meaning in life and harmful drinking are mediated by individual differences in both trait self-control and the value of alcohol.","['Alcohol', 'Demand', 'Maturing out', 'Meaning in life', 'Selfcontrol', 'Value']"
"Dose-Response Relationship Between External Load Variables, Body Composition, and Fitness Variables in Professional Soccer Players.","The aim of this study was to test associations between accumulated external load and changes in body composition, isokinetic strength, and aerobic capacity of soccer players. Twenty-three professional soccer players (age: 24.7 ± 2.8 years; height: 179.2 ± 6.3; experience: 9.7 ± 2.1 years) participated in this study. This pre-post study design was performed during 10 weeks from July to August of 2017 (4 weeks of pre-season and 6 weeks during the early season). Players were monitored daily by GPS technology and were assessed before and after a 10-week period in terms of body mass (BM), fat mass, lean mass, isokinetic strength at 60°/s, VO<sub>2max</sub>, and HR<sub>max</sub>. Large-to-very large positive correlations were found between the sum of sprinting distance and % differences of BM [0.70, (-0.09;0.95)], HR<sub>max</sub> [0.51, (-0.37;0.91)], agonist (quadriceps)/antagonist (hamstrings) left ratio [0.84, (0.27;0.97)] and agonist/antagonist right ratio [0.92, (0.58;0.99)]. Large positive correlations were found between the acceleration sum and % differences of VO<sub>2max</sub> [0.58, (-0.29;0.92)], quadriceps left peak torque [0.66, (-0.16;0.94)], hamstrings left peak torque [0.68, (-0.13;0.94)] and hamstrings right peak torque [0.62, (-0.22;0.93)]. Sprinting load was largely and positively associated with changes in knee strength asymmetries. Acceleration sum was largely and positively correlated with variations at VO<sub>2max</sub> and peak torques at hamstrings. In addition, dose-response relationships using external load variables were identified in professional soccer players.","['VO2max', 'association football', 'body fat', 'doseresponse', 'external load', 'isokinetic']"
Impact of HIGH BMI on Pregnancy: Maternal and Foetal Outcome.,"To review the effects of obesity (BMI > 30) on antepartum risk/intrapartum risk. To study neonatal outcome of pregnant women with raised BMI.BMI of 500 pregnant women booked before 12 weeks calculated and categorised as normal, overweight, obese and morbidly obese at GMCH, Aurangabad. Pregnant women with systemic disease and previous LSCS were excluded. Antepartum, intrapartum and neonatal variables were studied, and statistical analysis was carried out.Antepartum variables: prolonged pregnancy (<0.05), severe PIH (<0.05), PPROM (<0.05), gestational DM (<0.05) and anaemia (<0.05) are strongly associated with raised BMI, whereas abortion (>0.05), oligohydramnios (>0.05), UTI (>0.05) and abruption (>0.05) are not associated with raised BMI. Postpartum variables: PPH (<0.05), pyrexia (<0.05), prolonged hospital stay (<0.05) and lactational dysfunction (<0.05) are strongly associated with raised BMI, whereas UTI (>0.05), thrombophlebitis (>0.05) and endometritis (>0.05) are not associated with raised BMI. BMI Neonatal outcome: IUGR (<0.05), preterm (<0.05), postterm (<0.05), LBW (<0.05) and macrosomia (>0.05) are strongly associated with raised BMI, whereas stillbirth (>0.05), intubation (>0.05), RDS (>0.05) and baby died within 24 (>0.05) are not associated with raised BMI.Overweight and obesity are risk factors for AP/IP/PP complication.","['Antepartum complications', 'BMI', 'Morbidity', 'Obesity', 'Perinatal']"
The effect of Tabata-style functional high-intensity interval training on cardiometabolic health and physical activity in female university students.,"<b>Introduction:</b> The increasing prevalence of metabolic syndrome and physical inactivity enhances exposure to cardiometabolic risk factors in university students. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) improved cardiometabolic health in clinical adults but the evidence in the university setting is limited. Furthermore, few studies examined the effect of low-volume HIIT on habitual physical activity (PA). Therefore, the primary aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of 12-week Tabata-style functional HIIT for improving multiple cardiometabolic health outcomes and habitual PA. We also investigated whether changes in habitual PA over the intervention period had an impact on exercise-induced health outcomes. <b>Methods:</b> 122 female freshmen were randomized into the Tabata group (n = 60) and the control (n = 62). The Tabata training protocol involved 8 × 20 s maximal repeated functional exercises followed by 10 s rest with a frequency of 3 times per week for 12 weeks. Body composition, maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>), blood pressure (BP), blood lipids, fasting glucose and insulin, C-reactive protein and PA were objectively measured using standardized methods. Dietary intake was measured using a valid food frequency questionnaire. All variables were measured pre- and post-intervention. <b>Results:</b> Mixed linear modelling results showed that there were large intervention effects on VO<sub>2max</sub> (<i>p</i> < 0.001, d = 2.53, 95% CI: 2.03 to 3.00 for relative VO<sub>2max</sub>; <i>p</i> < 0.001, d = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.76 to 2.68 for absolute VO<sub>2max</sub>), resting heart rate (<i>p</i> < 0.001, d = -1.82, 95% CI: -2.23 to -1.37), systolic BP (<i>p</i> < 0.001, d = -1.24, 95% CI: -1.63 to -0.84), moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) (<i>p</i> < 0.001, d = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.83 to 2.77), total PA (<i>p</i> < 0.001, d = 1.98, 95% CI: 1.53 to 2.41); moderate effects on %BF (<i>p</i> < 0.001, d = -1.15, 95% CI: -1.53 to -0.75), FM (<i>p</i> < 0.001, d = -1.08, 95% CI: -1.46 to -0.69), high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (<i>p</i> < 0.001, d = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.65 to 1.42), total cholesterol (<i>p</i> = 0.001, d = -0.64, 95% CI: -1.00 to -0.26); small effects on BMI (<i>p</i> = 0.011, d = -0.48, 95% CI: -0.84 to 0.11), WC (<i>p</i> = 0.043, d = -0.37, 95% CI: -0.74 to -0.01), low-density lipoprotein (<i>p</i> = 0.003, d = -0.57, 95% CI: -0.93 to -0.19), HOMA-IR (<i>p</i> = 0.026, d = -0.42, 95% CI: -0.78 to -0.05) and fasting insulin (<i>p</i> = 0.035, d = -0.40, 95% CI: -0.76 to -0.03). Regression analysis showed that only the percentage change of HDL was associated with the change of MVPA (b = 0.326, <i>p</i> = 0.015) and TPA (b = 0.480, <i>p</i> = 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> From the findings of the study we can conclude that 12-week low-volume Tabata-style functional HIIT was highly effective for university female students to improve cardiorespiratory fitness, body fat, some cardiometabolic health outcomes and habitual PA.","['Tabata', 'cardiometabolic health', 'functional training', 'physical activity', 'young females']"
Patients with melanoma treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors who had non-thyroid endocrine and skin immune-related adverse events have better prognosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Several studies have reported an association between the occurrence of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and prognosis in patients with melanoma treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), but the results remain controversial. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the association between irAEs and survival in patients with melanoma treated with ICIs.We searched the PubMed, Web of Science, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases through May 5, 2022 for clinical studies evaluating the association between irAEs and in melanoma patients treated with ICIs. Combined hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were calculated using fixed- or random-effects models based on heterogeneity.A total of 60 articles were included, with 16,520 patients. In patients with melanoma treated with ICIs, the occurrence of irAEs was significantly associated with better OS (HR, 0.58; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.51-0.66; <i>P</i><0.00001) and PFS (HR, 0.61; 95%CI, 0.51-0.72; <i>P</i><0.00001). Endocrine irAEs (OS, HR, 0.81; 95%CI, 0.72-0.92; <i>P</i>=0.001; PFS: HR, 0.84; 95%CI, 0.73-0.96, <i>P</i>=0.009), skin irAEs (OS, HR, 0.59; 95%CI, 0.41-0.85; <i>P</i>=0.004; PFS: HR, 0.43; 95%CI, 0.36-0.52; <i>P</i><0.00001), vitiligo (OS, HR, 0.22; 95%CI, 0.15-0.31; <i>P</i><0.00001; PFS, HR, 0.33; 95%CI, 0.25-0.44; <i>P</i><0.00001), and grade 1-2 irAEs (OS, HR, 0.67; 95%CI, 0.58-0.78; <i>P</i><0.00001; PFS, HR, 0.62; 95%CI, 0.51-0.76; <i>P</i><0.00001) showed similar results. However, thyroid, lung, gastrointestinal, liver, and grade 3-4 irAEs were not significantly associated with OS and PFS. The occurrence of non-thyroid endocrine irAEs was significantly associated with better OS (HR, 0.22; 95%CI, 0.15-0.31; <i>P</i><0.00001). In patients with melanoma treated with anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (OS, HR, 0.61; 95%CI, 0.51-0.72; <i>P</i><0.00001; PFS, HR, 0.59; 95%CI, 0.47-0.74; <i>P</i><0.00001), the association between irAEs and clinical benefit was clearer than in patients treated with anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (OS, HR, 0.68; 95%CI, 0.52-0.89; <i>P</i>=0.005; PFS, HR, 0.93; 95%CI, 0.49-1.78; <i>P</i>=0.83).Among patients with melanoma treated with ICIs, those who developed non-thyroid endocrine irAEs and cutaneous irAEs have better prognosis. This suggests that non-thyroid endocrine irAEs and cutaneous irAEs may be a prognostic biomarker for patients with melanoma treated with ICIs.https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier CRD42022338308.","['immune checkpoint inhibitors', 'immunerelated adverse events', 'melanoma', 'metaanalysis', 'prognosis', 'survival']"
Enteric dysfunction and other factors associated with attained size at 5 years: MAL-ED birth cohort study findings.,"Poor growth in early childhood has been associated with increased risk of mortality and morbidity, as well as long-term deficits in cognitive development and economic productivity.Data from the MAL-ED cohort study were used to identify factors in the first 2 y of life that are associated with height-for-age, weight-for-age, and body mass index z-scores (HAZ, WAZ, BMIZ) at 5 y of age.A total of 1017 children were followed from near birth until 5 y of age at sites in Bangladesh, Brazil, India, Nepal, Peru, South Africa, and Tanzania. Data were collected on their growth, environmental enteric dysfunction (EED), micronutrient status, enteric pathogen burden, illness prevalence, dietary intake, and various other socio-economic and environmental factors.EED biomarkers were related to size at 5 y. Mean lactulose:mannitol z-scores during the first 2 y of life were negatively associated with all of the growth measures (HAZ: -0.11 [95% CI: -0.19, -0.03]; WAZ: -0.16 [95% CI: -0.26, -0.06]; BMIZ: -0.11 [95% CI: -0.23, 0.0]). Myeloperoxidase was negatively associated with weight (WAZ: -0.52 [95% CI: -0.78, -0.26] and BMIZ: -0.56 [95% CI: -0.86, -0.26]); whereas α-1-antitrypsin had a negative association with HAZ (-0.28 [95% CI: -0.52, -0.04]). Transferrin receptor was positively related to HAZ (0.18 [95% CI: 0.06, 0.30]) and WAZ (0.21 [95% CI: 0.07, 0.35]). Hemoglobin was positively related to HAZ (0.06 [95% CI: 0.00, 0.12]), and ferritin was negatively related to HAZ (-0.08 [95% CI: -0.12, -0.04]). Bacterial density in stool was negatively associated with HAZ (-0.04 [95% CI: -0.08, 0.00]), but illness symptoms did not have any effect on size at 5 y.EED markers, bacterial density, and iron markers are associated with growth at 5 y of age. Interventions to reduce bacterial burden and EED may improve long-term growth in low-income settings.","['enteric dysfunction', 'growth', 'inflammation', 'iron', 'permeability']"
Agreement in the scoring of respiratory events and sleep among international sleep centers.,"The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) guidelines for polysomnography (PSG) scoring are increasingly being adopted worldwide, but the agreement among international centers in scoring respiratory events and sleep stages using these guidelines is unknown. We sought to determine the interrater agreement of PSG scoring among international sleep centers.Prospective study of interrater agreement of PSG scoring.Nine center-members of the Sleep Apnea Genetics International Consortium (SAGIC).Fifteen previously recorded deidentified PSGs, in European Data Format, were scored by an experienced technologist at each site after they were imported into the locally used analysis software. Each 30-sec epoch was manually scored for sleep stage, arousals, apneas, and hypopneas using the AASM recommended criteria. The computer-derived oxygen desaturation index (ODI) was also recorded. The primary outcome for analysis was the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI). The ICCs of the respiratory variables were: AHI = 0.95 (95% confidence interval: 0.91-0.98), total apneas = 0.77 (0.56-0.87), total hypopneas = 0.80 (0.66-0.91), and ODI = 0.97 (0.93-0.99). The kappa statistics for sleep stages were: wake = 0.78 (0.77-0.79), nonrapid eye movement = 0.77 (0.76-0.78), N1 = 0.31 (0.30-0.32), N2 = 0.60 (0.59-0.61), N3 = 0.67 (0.65-0.69), and rapid eye movement = 0.78 (0.77-0.79). The ICC of the arousal index was 0.68 (0.50-0.85).There is strong agreement in the scoring of respiratory events among the SAGIC centers. There is also substantial epoch-by-epoch agreement in scoring sleep variables. Our results suggest that centralized scoring of PSGs may not be necessary in future research collaboration among international sites where experienced, well-trained scorers are involved.","['General', 'polysomnography', 'scoring']"
Assessing causal associations of hyperparathyroidism with blood counts and biochemical indicators: a Mendelian randomization study.,"The existing literature on the relationship of hyperparathyroidism with both blood counts and biochemical indicators primarily comprises observational studies, which have produced inconsistent findings. This study aimed to evaluate the causal relationship between hyperparathyroidism and blood counts and biochemical indicators.Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were conducted to investigate the associations between hyperparathyroidism and the identified 55 blood counts and biochemical indicators. The genome-wide association study (GWAS) for hyperparathyroidism data was obtained from FinnGen, while the GWASs for the blood counts and biochemical indicators were sourced from the UK Biobank (UKBB).The MR analysis using the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method revealed potential causality between genetically predicted hyperparathyroidism and seven out of 55 blood counts and biochemical indicators. These markers include ""Platelet count"" (Beta = -0.041; 95% CI: -0.066, -0.016; <i>p</i> = 0.001), ""Platelet distribution width (PDW)"" (Beta = 0.031; 95% CI: 0.006, 0.056; <i>p</i> = 0.016), ""Mean platelet volume (MPV)"" (Beta = 0.043; 95% CI: 0.010, 0.076; <i>p</i> = 0.011), ""Vitamin D"" (Beta = -0.038; 95% CI: -0.063, -0.013; <i>p</i> = 0.003), ""Calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>)"" (Beta = 0.266; 95% CI: 0.022, 0.509; <i>p</i> = 0.033), ""Phosphate"" (Beta = -0.114; 95% CI: -0.214, -0.014; <i>p</i> = 0.025), and ""Alkaline phosphatase (ALP)"" (Beta = 0.030; 95% CI: 0.010, 0.049; <i>p</i> = 0.003).The findings of our study revealed a suggestive causal relationship between hyperparathyroidism and blood cell count as well as biochemical markers. This presents a novel perspective for further investigating the etiology and pathological mechanisms underlying hyperparathyroidism.","['Mendelian randomization', 'biochemical indicators', 'blood counts', 'causal association', 'hyperparathyroidism']"
"Relationship between dietary variety, adequacy, moderation, and balanced diet and cardiovascular risk factors.","The relationship between dietary variety, adequacy, moderation, and balanced diet as diet quality indices and cardiovascular risk factors has not been yet evaluated amongst patients with Mmyocardial Iinfarction (MI).This cross-sectional study was conducted on 225 males and 93 females with MI who were admitted in two heart hospitals, Shiraz, Iran from November 2019 to April 2020. Dietary intake was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire and the Diet Quality Index-International (DQI-I). DQI-I included four subscales, namely variety (20 scores), adequacy (40 scores), moderation (30 scores), and balanced diet (10 scores).The mean age of the participants was 54 ± 8 years. The mean scores of total DQI-I and variety, adequacy, moderation, and balanced diet subscales were 58 ± 12.2, 12.7 ± 3.8, 28.5 ± 7.0, 9.88 ± 5.6, and 7.8 ± 1.1, respectively. The results showed that waist circumference (WC) was influenced by adequacy (-0.26 ± 0.04) and moderation (-0.28 ± 0.03) subscales, while body mass index (BMI)was only related to the moderation subscale (0.15 ± 0.07). Additionally, low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol was influenced by variety (-0.18 ± 0.01), adequacy (-0.14 ± 0.02), moderation (-0.2 ± 0.02), and balanced diet (-0.2 ± 0.003) subscales, while total cholesterol was associated with the adequacy subscale (-0.18 ± 0.01). In addition, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol was related to variety (0.16 ± 0.03), moderation (0.14 ± 0.04), and balanced diet (0.13 ± 0.01) subscales,while triglyceride was only influenced by the variety subscale (-0.15 ± 0.004).Dietary advice based on variety, adequacy, moderation, and balanced diet could be useful in practice to provide personalized messages to improve the risk factors amongst patients with MI.","['Diet Therapy', 'Heart Disease Risk Factors', 'Myocardial Infarction']"
Transversus Abdominis Plane Block With Liposomal Bupivacaine vs. Regular Anesthetics for Pain Control After Surgery: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"<b>Background:</b> Transverse abdominal plane (TAP) blocks are used to provide pain relief after abdominopelvic surgeries. The role of liposomal bupivacaine (LB) for TAP blocks is unclear. Therefore, this study aimed to synthesize evidence on the efficacy of LB vs. regular anesthetics in improving outcomes of TAP block. <b>Methods:</b> PubMed, Science Direct, Embase, Springer, and CENTRAL databases were searched up to July 24, 2020. Studies comparing LB with any regular anesthetic for TAP block for any surgical procedure and reporting total analgesic consumption (TAC) or pain scores were included. <b>Results:</b> Seven studies including five randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were reviewed. LB was compared with regular bupivacaine (RB) in all studies. A descriptive analysis was conducted for TAC due to heterogeneity in data presentation. There were variations in the outcomes of studies reporting TAC. Meta-analysis of pain scores indicated statistically significant reduction of pain with the use of LB at 12 h (MD: -0.89 95% CI: -1.44, -0.34 I<sup>2</sup> = 0% <i>p</i> = 0.01), 24 h (MD: -0.64 95% CI: -1.21, -0.06 I<sup>2</sup> = 0% <i>p</i> = 0.03), 48 h (MD: -0.40 95% CI: -0.77, 0.04 I<sup>2</sup> = 0% <i>p</i> = 0.03) but not at 72 h (MD: -0.37 95% CI: -1.31, 0.56 I<sup>2</sup> = 57% <i>p</i> = 0.43). Pooled analysis indicated no difference in the duration of hospital stay between LB and RB (MD: -0.18 95% CI: -0.49, 0.14 I<sup>2</sup> = 61% <i>p</i> = 0.27). LB significantly reduced the number of days to first ambulation postsurgery (MD: -0.28 95% CI: -0.50, -0.06 I<sup>2</sup> = 0% <i>p</i> = 0.01). <b>Conclusions:</b> Current evidence on the role of LB for providing prolonged analgesia with TAP blocks is unclear. Conflicting results have been reported for TAC. LB may result in a small reduction in pain scores up to 48 h but not at 72 h. Further, high-quality homogenous RCTs are needed to establish high-quality evidence.","['extended analgesia', 'local anesthetic', 'opioids', 'pain', 'surgery']"
Inflammatory Long Pentraxin 3 is Associated with Leukocyte Telomere Length in Night-Shift Workers.,"Aging is an emerging worldwide threat to public health, even in the workplace, as it links with risk of illness and death. Bewildered inflammatory responses and stressful conditions associate with age-related disorders. Additionally, circadian rhythm disruption, a critical health issue in night-shift workers, correlates with premature aging. We investigated the hypothesis of a link between altered inflammatory response, detected by plasmatic long pentraxin 3 (PTX3), and biological aging, measured by leukocyte telomere length (LTL), attrition, and possibly induced by night-shift work. Within the framework of a cross-sectional study, such possible relationships were appraised by simultaneous equation model (SEM) technique among day and night-shift hospital workers. PTX3 levels, modulated by several aging conditions [i.e., body mass index (BMI) (beta = -0.22; <i>p</i> = 0.022), C-reactive protein (CRP) (beta = -0.07; <i>p</i> = 0.000), and cardiovascular diseases with hypertension included (CVD) (beta = -0.12; <i>p</i> = 0.000)], positively associate with LTL (coefficient = 0.15; <i>p</i> = 0.033). LTL, in turn is reduced by CVD (beta = -0.15; <i>p</i> = 0.000), binge drinking (beta = -0.10; <i>p</i> = 0.004), and CRP (beta = -0.05; <i>p</i> = 0.026). On the other hand, night-shift work, found to be remarkably free from aging risk factors [i.e., age (beta = -0.13; <i>p</i> = 0.017), BMI (beta = -0.17; <i>p</i> = 0.030), CVD (beta = -0.14; <i>p</i> = 0.000), and binge drinking (beta = -0.13; <i>p</i> = 0.000)], does associate almost significantly with reversed PTX3 (coefficient = -0.09; <i>p</i> = 0.089) and even with CRP (beta = 0.17; <i>p</i> = 0.000). In conclusion, the SEM analysis indicates that PTX3 is positively linked to LTL. The finding suggests a possible new role of this long pentraxin that, by orchestrating an efficient governance of inflammatory processes, may protect telomere from attrition, ensuring therefore the genetic stability of cells. The higher CRP levels among night-shift workers suggest that night-shift work is associated with increased systemic inflammation. This would make nocturnal workers more susceptible to premature aging.","['aging', 'circadian rhythm', 'genetic instability', 'inflammation', 'nightshift work', 'pentraxin 3', 'premature', 'telomere']"
Sensitivity and specificity of the Distress Thermometer in screening for distress in long-term nasopharyngeal cancer survivors.,"The Distress Thermometer (dt) is a screening tool recommended to quickly identify cancer patients with distress. Our study aimed to examine the sensitivity and specificity of the dt in detecting psychological distress in long-term Chinese nasopharyngeal cancer (npc) survivors.Data for the 442 participating npc survivors were collected through a self-administered questionnaire based on the dt and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (hads). The hads was used to define cases of psychological distress. Positive and negative groups were defined based on 4 hads criteria (Anxiety, Depression, Anxiety or Depression, and overall score). Receiver operating characteristic (roc) curves were used to examine the ability of all possible cut-off values of the dt to detect positive and negative cases. For each roc curve, the area under the curve (auc) was used as an indicator of the overall accuracy of the dt to identify positive cases of distress.The positive auc values [with 95% confidence intervals (ci)] for the 4 hads criteria were 0.715 (95% ci: 0.667 to 0.764), 0.714 (95% ci: 0.661 to 0.768), 0.724 (95% ci: 0.677 to 0.771), and 0.724 (95% ci: 0.664 to 0.775) respectively. At a cut-off score of 4, the sensitivity of the dt to the four hads criteria was, respectively, 0.366 (95% ci: 0.296 to 0.436), 0.448 (95% ci: 0.364 to 0.532), 0.362 (95% ci: 0.299 to 0.425), and 0.421 (95% ci: 0.339 to 0.502), and the specificity of the dt to the 4 hads criteria was, respectively, 0.860 (95% ci: 0.818 to 0.902), 0.860 (95% ci: 0.821 to 0.899), 0.854 (95% ci: 0.814 to 0.894), and 0.854 (95% ci: 0.814 to 0.894). At a cut-off score of 5, the corresponding sensitivities were lower than those at the cut-off score of 4. All potential cut-off scores showed poor sensitivity (<0.90).The roc analysis showed poor discrimination. No potential dt cut-off score had an acceptable sensitivity. The dt showed poor sensitivity in npc survivors. Thus, the dt might not be a valid scale for psychological distress screening in long-term Chinese npc survivors.","['Distress', 'Distress Thermometer', 'nasopharyngeal cancer survivors', 'validity']"
Prevalence of Achilles tendinopathy in physical exercise: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis assessed the prevalence of Achilles tendinopathy (AT) in physical exercise (PE).

Random-effects, subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis and meta-regressions were conducted, involving 16 publications. This meta-analysis found that the overall prevalence of AT was 0.06 (95%<i>CI</i>, 0.04-0.07). The prevalence of Achilles tendon rupture was 0.03 (95%<i>CI</i>, 0.02-0.05). Subgroup analysis showed that the prevalence of AT increased with age, the highest among the group aged over 45 (0.08; 95%<i>CI</i>, 0.04-0.11), and the lowest among the group under 18 years old (0.02; 95%<i>CI</i>, 0.01-0.03). The gymnastics and ball games had the highest prevalence of AT, at (0.17; 95%<i>CI</i>, 0.14-0.20) and (0.06; 95%<i>CI</i>, 0.02-0.11), respectively. The prevalence of AT in athletes (0.06; 95%<i>CI</i>, 0.04-0.08) was higher than that of amateur exercisers (0.04; 95%<i>CI</i>, 0.02-0.06) and there was no difference in the prevalence of AT between males and females. There are differences in the prevalence of AT in different ages, sport events and characteristics of participants. This systematic review and meta-analysis suggested that it was necessary to pay more attention to AT in people who were older or engaged in gymnastics.","['Achilles tendinopathy', 'Physical exercise', 'Prevalence', 'metaAnalysis']"
Feasibility of predicting live birth by combining conventional embryo evaluation with artificial intelligence applied to a blastocyst image in patients classified by age.,"To identify the multivariate logistic regression in a combination (combination method) involving artificial intelligence (AI) classifiers in images of blastocysts along with a conventional embryo evaluation (CEE) to predict the probability of accomplishing a live birth in patients classified by maternal age.Retrospectively, a total of 5691 blastocysts were enrolled. Images captured 115 hours or 139 hours if not yet sufficiently large after insemination were classified according to age as follows: <35, 35-37, 38-39, 40-41, and ≥42 years old. The classifiers for each category were created by using convolutional neural networks associated with deep learning. Next, the feasibility of a method combining AI with multivariate logistic model functions by CEE was investigated.The values of the area under the curve (AUC) and the accuracies to predict live birth achieved by the CEE/AI/combination methods were 0.651/0.634/0.655, 0.697/0.688/0.723, 0.771/0.728/0.791, 0.788/0.743/0.806 and 0.820/0.837/0.888, and 0.631/0.647/0.616, 0.687/0.675/0.671, 0.725/0.697/0.732, 0.714/0.776/0.801, and 0.910/0.866/0.784 for age categories of <35, 35-37, 38-39, 40-41, and ≥42 years old, respectively.Though there were mostly no significant differences regarding the AUC and the sensitivity plus specificity in all age categories, the combination method seemed to be the best.","['artificial intelligence', 'blastocyst', 'deep learning', 'live birth', 'neural network']"
Determinants of Spontaneous Preterm Labor and Birth Including Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease and Periodontitis.,"Periodontitis is reported to be associated with preterm birth (spontaneous preterm labor and birth). Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is common during pregnancy and is expected to be related to periodontitis. However, little research has been done on the association among preterm birth, GERD and periodontitis. This study uses popular machine learning methods for analyzing preterm birth, GERD and periodontitis.Data came from Anam Hospital in Seoul, Korea, with 731 obstetric patients during January 5, 1995 - August 28, 2018. Six machine learning methods were applied and compared for the prediction of preterm birth. Variable importance, the effect of a variable on model performance, was used for identifying major determinants of preterm birth.In terms of accuracy, the random forest (0.8681) was similar with logistic regression (0.8736). Based on variable importance from the random forest, major determinants of preterm birth are delivery and pregestational body mass indexes (BMI) (0.1426 and 0.1215), age (0.1211), parity (0.0868), predelivery systolic and diastolic blood pressure (0.0809 and 0.0763), twin (0.0476), education (0.0332) as well as infant sex (0.0331), prior preterm birth (0.0290), progesterone medication history (0.0279), upper gastrointestinal tract symptom (0.0274), GERD (0.0242), <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (0.0151), region (0.0139), calcium-channel-blocker medication history (0.0135) and gestational diabetes mellitus (0.0130). Periodontitis ranked 22nd (0.0084).GERD is more important than periodontitis for predicting and preventing preterm birth. For preventing preterm birth, preventive measures for hypertension, GERD and diabetes mellitus would be needed alongside the promotion of effective BMI management and appropriate progesterone and calcium-channel-blocker medications.","['Gastroesophageal Reflux', 'Periodontitis', 'Premature Birth']"
"An in-depth discussion of cholesteatoma, middle ear Inflammation, and langerhans cell histiocytosis of the temporal bone, based on diagnostic results.","This study aimed to conduct an in-depth investigation of the learning framework used for deriving diagnostic results of temporal bone diseases, including cholesteatoma and Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). In addition, middle ear inflammation (MEI) was diagnosed by CT scanning of the temporal bone in pediatric patients.A total of 119 patients were included in this retrospective study; among them, 40 patients had MEI, 38 patients had histology-proven cholesteatoma, and 41 patients had histology-proven LCH of the temporal bone. Each of the 119 patients was matched with one-third of the disease labels. The study included otologists and radiologists, and the reference criteria were histopathology results (70% of cases for training and 30% of cases for validation). A multilayer perceptron artificial neural network (VGG16_BN) was employed and classified, based on radiometrics. This framework structure was compared and analyzed by clinical experts according to CT images and performance.The deep learning framework results vs. a physician's diagnosis, respectively, in multiclassification tasks, were as follows. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) (cholesteatoma): (0.98 vs. 0.91), LCH (0.99 vs. 0.98), and MEI (0.99 vs. 0.85). Accuracy (cholesteatoma): (0.99 vs. 0.89), LCH (0.99 vs. 0.97), and MEI (0.99 vs. 0.89). Sensitivity (cholesteatoma): (0.96 vs. 0.97), LCH (0.99 vs. 0.98), and MEI (1 vs. 0.69). Specificity (cholesteatoma): (1 vs. 0.89), LCH (0.99 vs. 0.97), and MEI (0.99 vs. 0.89).This article presents a research and learning framework for the diagnosis of cholesteatoma, MEI, and temporal bone LCH in children, based on CT scans. The research framework performed better than the clinical experts.","['PyTorch', 'cholesteatoma', 'computed tomography CT scan', 'deep learning', 'langerhans cell histiocytosis']"
Distribution of IOP and its relationship with refractive error and other factors: the Anyang University Students Eye Study.,"To investigate the distribution of intraocular pressure (IOP) and its relationship with refractive error and other factors in university students from Anyang, China.A university-based study was conducted. Subjects were invited to complete ophthalmic examinations, including visual acuity, noncontact tonometry (NCT), cycloplegic autorefraction, and ocular biometry. Univariable and multivariable analyses were used to evaluate the associations between IOP and other factors. Only data from right eyes were used in analysis.A total of 7720 subjects aged 16 to 26 years old were included, and 2834 (36.4%) of the participants were male. The mean IOP of the right eye for all subjects was 15.52±3.20 mm Hg (95%CI: 15.45, 15.59). Using multivariate linear regression analysis, IOP was found to correlate significantly with younger age (<i>P</i><0.001; standardized regression coefficient <i>β</i>, -0.061; regression coefficient <i>β</i>, -0.139; 95%CI: -0.18, -0.09), higher myopic refractive error (<i>P</i>=0.044; standardized <i>β</i>, -0.060; regression coefficient <i>β</i>, -0.770; 95%CI: -0.15, -0.002), higher central corneal thickness (<i>P</i><0.001; standardized <i>β</i>, 0.450; regression coefficient <i>β</i>, 0.044; 95%CI: 0.04, 0.05), and shorter axial length (AL; <i>P</i><0.001; standardized <i>β</i>, -0.061; regression coefficient <i>β</i>, -0.163; 95%CI: -0.25, -0.07).This study described the normal distribution of IOP. In Chinese university students aged 16-26y, higher IOP is associated with younger age, higher myopic refractive error, higher thickness of the central cornea, and shorter AL.","['epidemiology', 'intraocular pressure', 'refractive errors', 'university students']"
Burden of Hypertension and Abnormal Glomerular Permeability in Hypertensive School Children.,"Childhood hypertension has been associated with target-organ damage in young adults. It is often asymptomatic in both children and adolescents; when persistent, and long-standing, it could be a significant risk factor for kidney damage and increased glomerular permeability.Burden of hypertension and its impact on glomerular permeability were prospectively determined in randomly recruited primary school children.Blood pressure (BP) measurement was performed by the auscultation method, and abnormal glomerular permeability was assessed by dipstick testing of urine for persistent proteinuria and/or hematuria for ≥ three months in hypertensive children.Of 1,335 pupils aged 10.0 ± 2.4 (6.0 - 14.0) years, 33 (2.5%) were hypertensive. Overall mean systolic/diastolic BP was 125.6 ± 6.5/81.7 ± 3.3 (range: 114.0 - 140.0/80.0 - 90.0) mmHg. Nine (27.3%) had combined systolic and diastolic hypertension, 126.7 ± 5.7/80.0 - 80.0 ± 0.0 (120.0 - 130.0/80.0 - 80.0) mmHg. Isolated systolic hypertension, 125.4 ± 6.7 (114.0 - 140.0) mmHg, was present in 14 (42.4%), whereas 10 (30.3%) had isolated diastolic hypertension, 82.0 ± 3.5 (80.0 - 90.0) mmHg. Mean systolic and diastolic BP were 131.0 ± 3.3 (130.0 - 140.0) mmHg and 86.5 ± 4.43 (80.0 - 90.0) mmHg, respectively. According to the dipstick test, none of the hypertensive pupils showed urinalysis evidence of proteinuria and/or hematuria after three months of testing.Although the burden of hypertension was 2.5%, the dipstick method did not detect any hypertension-related abnormal glomerular permeability in the school children.","['Glomerular Permeability', 'Hypertension', 'Proteinuria', 'School Children']"
Placido disk-based topography versus high-resolution rotating Scheimpflug camera for corneal power measurements in keratoconic and post-LASIK eyes: reliability and agreement.,"To compare the repeatability/reproducibility of measurement by high-resolution Placido disk-based topography with that of a high-resolution rotating Scheimpflug camera and assess the agreement between the two instruments in measuring corneal power in eyes with keratoconus and post-laser <i>in situ</i> keratomileusis (LASIK).One eye each of 36 keratoconic patients and 20 subjects who had undergone LASIK was included in this prospective observational study. Two independent examiners worked in a random order to take three measurements of each eye with both instruments. Four parameters were measured on the anterior cornea: steep keratometry (Ks), flat keratometry (Kf), mean keratometry (Km), and astigmatism (Ks-Kf). Intra-examiner repeatability and inter-examiner reproducibility were evaluated by calculating the within-subject standard deviation (Sw) the coefficient of repeatability (R), the coefficient of variation (CoV), and the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Agreement between instruments was tested with the Bland-Altman method by calculating the 95% limits of agreement (95% LoA).In keratoconic eyes, the intra-examiner and inter-examiner ICC were >0.95. As compared with measurement by high-resolution Placido disk-based topography, the intra-examiner R of the high-resolution rotating Scheimpflug camera was lower for Kf (0.32 <i>vs</i> 0.88), Ks (0.61 <i>vs</i> 0.88), and Km (0.32 <i>vs</i> 0.84) but higher for Ks-Kf (0.70 <i>vs</i> 0.57). Inter-examiner R values were lower for all parameters measured using the high-resolution rotating Scheimpflug camera. The 95% LoA were -1.28 to +0.55 for Kf, -1.36 to +0.99 for Ks, -1.08 to +0.50 for Km, and -1.11 to +1.48 for Ks-Kf. In the post-LASIK eyes, the intra-examiner and inter-examiner ICC were >0.87 for all parameters. The intra-examiner and inter-examiner R were lower for all parameters measured using the high-resolution rotating Scheimpflug camera. The intra-examiner R was 0.17 <i>vs</i> 0.88 for Kf, 0.21 <i>vs</i> 0.88 for Ks, 0.17 <i>vs</i> 0.86 for Km, and 0.28 <i>vs</i> 0.33 for Ks-Kf. The inter-examiner R was 0.09 <i>vs</i> 0.64 for Kf, 0.15 <i>vs</i> 0.56 for Ks, 0.09 <i>vs</i> 0.59 for Km, and 0.18 <i>vs</i> 0.23 for Ks-Kf. The 95% LoA were -0.54 to +0.58 for Kf, -0.51 to +0.53 for Ks and Km, and -0.28 to +0.27 for Ks-Kf.As compared with Placido disk-based topography, the high-resolution rotating Scheimpflug camera provides more repeatable and reproducible measurements of Ks, Kf and Ks in keratoconic and post-LASIK eyes. Agreement between instruments is fair in keratoconus and very good in post-LASIK eyes.","['Placido diskbased topography', 'Scheimpflug camera', 'corneal power measurement', 'keratoconus', 'postLASIK']"
Evaluation of the efficiency and safety of TransPRK and FS-LASIK refractive procedures on patients with astigmatism and amblyopia.,"<b>Purpose:</b> To compare the outcomes of transepithelial photorefractive keratectomy (transPRK) with femtosecond laser assisted in situ keratomileusis (FS-LASIK) for the correction of astigmatism on amblyopic eyes. <b>Methods:</b> The design was a retrospective interventional study on 37 eyes with hyperopic or mixed astigmatism and refractive amblyopia, which underwent transPRK or FS-LASIK. The patients were distributed into 2 groups according to the technique used. Data was collected from patient files and comparison between groups was performed. The main outcomes measured were corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), sphere, cylinder, spherical equivalent (SEQ), efficiency and safety indexes. <b>Results:</b> In the transPRK group, SEQ improved significantly after 1 month, from 2.08 ± 2.02D (p<0.01) to 0.125 ± 0.86D and at the 12 month visit to -0.04 ± 0.62D (p>0.05), sphere improved from 4.03 ± 1.44D preoperatively to 0.67 ± 0.9D at 1 month (p<0.05) and further to 0.44 ± 0.71 at 12 months (p<0.05). CDVA improved from 0.194 ± 0.11 logMAR to 0.115 ± 0.1 logMAR at the 1-year visit. Safety index after 1 month was 1.09 ± 0.2 and 1.12 ± 0.35 at the 1-year visit. Efficiency index was 0.95 ± 0.22 at 1 month and 1.03 ± 0.34 after 1 year. In FS-LASIK group, SEQ improved after 1 month, from 2.28 ± 3.04 to -0.79 ± 0.73D (p<0.01), and further to -0.49 ± 0.79 (p>0.05) at the 12 month visit, sphere improved from 4.11 ± 2.35D preoperatively to -0.42 ± 0.66D at 1 month (p<0.05) and further to -0.08 ± 0.75D at 12 months (p<0.05). CDVA also improved from 0.191 ± 0.1 logMAR to 0.140 ± 0.1 logMAR at 1 year. Safety index after 1 month was 1.1 ± 0.2 and 1.16 ± 0.21 at the 1-year visit.

Insulin resistance since early adulthood and appendicular lean mass in middle-aged adults without diabetes: 20 years of the CARDIA study.,"To determine the association between 20-year trajectories in insulin resistance (IR) since young adulthood and appendicular lean mass (ALM) at middle-age in adults without diabetes.A prospective cohort study was designed among young and middle-aged US men (n = 925) and women (n = 1193). Fasting serum glucose and insulin were measured five times in 1985-2005. IR was determined using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA). ALM was measured in 2005 and ALM adjusted for BMI (ALM/BMI) was the outcome. Sex-specific analyses were performed.Three HOMA-IR trajectories were identified. Compared to the low-stable group, the adjusted ALM/BMI difference was -0.041 (95% CI: -0.060 to -0.022) and -0.114 (-0.141 to -0.086) in men, and -0.052 (-0.065 to -0.039) and -0.043 (-0.063 to -0.023) in women, respectively, for the medium-increase and high-increase groups. Further adjusting for the treadmill test duration attenuated these estimates to -0.022 (-0.040 to -0.004) and -0.061 (-0.089 to -0.034) in men and -0.026 (-0.038 to -0.014) and -0.007 (-0.026 to 0.012) in women.Compared to the low-stable insulin resistance trajectory between early and middle adulthood, the high-increase trajectory was associated with lower ALM/BMI in middle-aged men, but not women, without diabetes, after adjusting for cardiorespiratory fitness.","['Appendicular lean mass', 'Diabetes', 'Early prevention', 'Insulin resistance', 'Sarcopenia']"
"Greenhouse gas emission, GDP, tertiary education, and rule of law: A comparative study between high-income and lower-middle income countries.","Global climate change is a pressing concern, particularly in underdeveloped countries. Because greenhouse gases are a key cause of climate change and economic growth is tied to emissions. The study aimed to determine how the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), Tertiary Education, and Rule of Law could be utilized more effectively to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The study used data from 30 Lower-Middle Income Countries (LMICs) and 10 High-Income Countries (HICs), as grouped by the World Bank, for the period between 2000 and 2014. In this study, sum of greenhouse gas emission is the response variable and GDP value, Gross enrollment in tertiary education, Rule of law index are the key explanatory variables. Independent sample <i>t</i>-test and multiple linear regression models were applied to analyze the data. The study found a significant impact of GDP on greenhouse gas emissions [0.722, (0.653, 0.790), p < 0.01] for LMICs and [-0.605, (-0.728, -0.482), p < 0.01] for HICs. For Tertiary Education, the regression model coefficient is [-0.187, (-0.274, -0.100), p < 0.01], and [0.480, (0.356, 0.603), p < 0.01], respectively for the LMICs and HICs. And the Rule of Law index [-0.046, (-0.112, 0.020), p = 0.170], and [0.099, (-0.028, -0.227), p = 0.125] for LMICs and HICs respectively came out as statistically not significant although from the mean test, the difference between the mean of the variable Rule of Law of LMCs and HICs is statistically significant [p < 0.01] thus, it has some impact on the efficient use of economic growth. This study concludes that in the LMICs, greenhouse gas emissions are highly positively associated with GDP and the negative coefficient for tertiary education indicates it holds down the emissions. For the HICs, it is evident that GDP is not a major driver and positive significance for tertiary education indicates that the greenhouse gas emissions may result from extravagant operations that might be linked with higher tertiary education, which requires further analysis.","['CO2 emission', 'Developed vs developing country carbon emission', 'Economic growth and greenhouse gas', 'Greenhouse gas emission', 'Rich vs poor country carbon emission']"
[Correlation between metabolic syndrome and prognosis of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma].,"To investigate the effects of MetS on the prognosis of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC).Clinical and pathological data and the laboratory test of ccRCC 342 patients with diverticular stones who underwent ccRCC who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy were retrospectively collected and analyzed.The patients were divided into MetS group and non-MetS group, and the subgroups were defined according to the tumor size. The overall survival (OS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and progression-free survival (PFS) of the two groups were analyzed by univariate Cox analysis, and the subgroup analyses were also performed. Kaplan-Meier survival curve and survival analysis for OS, CSS, and PFS of the two groups and the subgroups were conducted.Univariate Cox analysis showed that MetS was a protective factor of postoperative OS [hazard ratio (<i>HR</i>)=0.551, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.321-0.949, <i>P</i>=0.031], CSS (<i>HR</i>=0.460, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.234-0.905, <i>P</i>=0.025), and PFS (HR 0.585, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.343-0.998, <i>P</i>=0.049) in the patients with ccRCC. In the subgroup with tumor size≤4 cm, MetS was not associated with postoperative OS (<i>HR</i>=0.857, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.389-1.890, <i>P</i>=0.702), CSS (<i>HR</i>=1.129, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.364-3.502, <i>P</i>=0.833), and PFS (<i>HR</i>=1.554, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.625-3.864, <i>P</i>=0.343). In the subgroup with tumor size>4 cm, Mets was a protective factor of postoperative OS (HR=0.377, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.175-0.812, <i>P=</i>0.013), CSS (<i>HR</i>=0.280, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.113-0.690, <i>P</i>=0.006), and PFS (<i>HR</i>=0.332, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.157-0.659, <i>P</i>=0.002); Obesity was a protective factor of postoperative CSS (<i>HR</i>=0.464, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.219-0.981, <i>P</i>=0.044), and PFS (<i>HR</i>=0.445, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.238-0.833, <i>P</i>=0.011). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the long-term survival of patients with MetS was better than those without MetS in OS (<i>P</i>=0.029), CSS (<i>P</i>=0.021), and PFS (<i>P=</i>0.046); for the subgroup with tumor size≤4 cm, there was no significant difference in postoperative OS (<i>P</i>=0.702), CSS (<i>P</i>=0.833), and PFS (<i>P</i>=0.339) between patients with and without MetS; For the subgroup with tumor size>4 cm, the OS (<i>P</i>=0.010), CSS (<i>P=</i>0.003), and PFS (<i>P</i>=0.001) of patients with MetS were better than those without MetS.MetS was a protective factor of postoperative OS, CSS, and PFS in the patients with ccRCC, which was more obvious in subgroup with tumor size>4 cm. And obesity, the component of MetS, was correlated with postoperative OS and CSS.","['Cancerspecific survival', 'Clear cell renal cell carcinoma', 'Metabolic syndrome', 'Overall survival', 'Progressionfree survival']"
The Association of Dietary Vitamin Intake Time Across a Day With Cardiovascular Disease and All-Cause Mortality.,"Chrono-nutrition emphasized the importance of the intake time; however, less is known about the impact of dietary vitamin intake time on health. This study aimed to examine our hypothesis about which vitamin intake time could influence the natural course of cardiovascular disease (CVD).A total of 27,455 adults enrolled in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) during 2003-2014 were recruited. The 12 dietary vitamin intakes in the morning, afternoon, and evening were categorized into tertiles or quartiles. Cox-proportional hazard regression models were developed to evaluate the association of vitamin intake time with CVD and all-cause mortalities.Compared with participants in the lowest quartile, participants in the highest quartile of dietary VB2 intake in the morning had significantly lowest mortality risk of CVD [hazard ratio (HR)<sub>VB2</sub> = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.60-0.94, <i>p</i> = 0.017]; whereas, participants in the highest quartile of dietary-vitamin B6 (VB6), vitamin C (VC), vitamin E (VE), and folate-equivalent consumed in the evening showed the lowest risks of CVD (HR<sub>VB6</sub> = 0.77, 95% CI: 0.60-0.99, <i>p</i> = 0.103; HR<sub>VC</sub> = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.65-0.98, <i>p</i> = 0.050; HR<sub>VE</sub> = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.56-0.99, <i>p</i> = 0.032; HR<sub>folate-equivalent</sub> = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.63-0.97, <i>p</i> = 0.116) and all-cause mortalities (HR<sub>VB6</sub> = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.71-0.93, <i>p</i> = 0.006; HR<sub>VC</sub> = 0.85, 95% CI: 0.76-0.95, <i>p</i> = 0.004; HR<sub>VE</sub> = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.72-0.97, <i>p</i> = 0.011; HR<sub>folate-equivalent</sub> = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.71-0.90, <i>p</i> = 0.001). Moreover, equivalently replacing 10% intake of dietary VB6, VC, VE, and folate-equivalent in the morning with evening were associated with 4% (HR<sub>VB6</sub> = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.92-0.99), 5% (HR<sub>VC</sub> = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.99), 4% (HR<sub>VE</sub> = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.91-0.99), and 5% (HR<sub>folate-equivalent</sub> = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92-0.99) lower risk of CVD mortality.This study found that the optimal intake time of dietary VB2 was in the morning, and the optimal intake times of dietary VB6, VC, VE, and folate-equivalent were in the evening.","['allcause mortality', 'cardiovascular disease mortality', 'chrononutrition', 'dietary vitamins', 'intake time']"
Optimisation of airway management strategies: a prospective before-and-after study on events related to airway management.,"Poor medical outcomes often result from series of minor events. The present study assessed events related to airway management to determine whether targeted changes to departmental strategies for airway management can reduce the incidence.This prospective before-and-after study was performed with ethics committee approval and written informed consent from patients. Major and minor events related to airway management were prospectively recorded for 9 weeks. After implementation of changes to departmental strategies for airway management, events were again prospectively recorded over 9 weeks. Primary outcome was number of cases with events. Secondary outcomes were various predefined events.At study baseline, 3668 cases and at follow-up 3786 cases were assessed. Cases with events decreased from 566 (15.4%) to 433 (11.4%) (risk ratio [RR]=0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.66-0.83; P<0.01). As secondary outcomes, the following events decreased: Cormack-Lehane grade 3 or 4 (4.3-2.9%; RR=0.67; 95% CI, 0.52-0.85; P<0.01); difficult bag-mask ventilation (3.8-2.7%; RR=0.69; 95% CI, 0.54-0.89; P<0.01); hypoxaemia (3.8-2.9%; RR=0.75; 95% CI, 0.59-0.96; P=0.03); unplanned use of special equipment (3.2-2.0%; RR=0.62; (95% CI, 0.47-0.83; P<0.01); oesophageal intubation (1.3-0.8%; RR=0.61; 95% CI, 0.39-0.96; P=0.03); bleeding (0.8-0.2%; RR=0.30; 95% CI, 0.14-0.63; P<0.01); insufficient spontaneous breathing (0.3-0.0%; RR=0.09; 95% CI, 0.01-0.68; P<0.01); communication errors (0.1-0.0%; RR=0; 95% CI, 0-NA; P=0.03).Implementation of changes to departmental strategies for airway management significantly reduced cases with events related to airway management. Analysis of events and implementation of strategies that specifically target identified issues might be key to improving airway management.NCT02743767.","['airway complications', 'airway management', 'major airway events', 'minor airway events', 'patient safety']"
A Limited Survey of Metal Content in Blue Jack Mackerel ( Trachurus picturatus) Obtained from Markets in the Canary Islands.,"The levels of 20 metals (aluminum, boron, barium, calcium, cadmium, cobalt, chromium, copper, iron, potassium, lithium, magnesium, manganese, molybdenum, sodium, nickel, lead, strontium, vanadium, and zinc) were analyzed in muscle and liver tissue of Trachurus picturatus marketed in the Canary Islands (Spain) by using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. In the liver samples, the mean concentrations in milligrams per kilogram wet weight (wt) of Al (14.7), B (0.99), Ba (1.64), Ca (314), Cd (2.52), Co (0.15), Cu (4.07), Fe (106), Li (3.89), Mn (0.85), Mo (0.16), Na (1510), Ni (0.51), Pb (0.36), Sr (3.54), V (0.78), and Zn (23.13) were higher than those detected in the muscle samples in milligrams per killogram wet wt, which were as follows: Al (8.76), B (0.07), Ba (0.30), Ca (210), Cd (0.01), Co (0.01), Cu (1.51 ), Fe (7.33), Li (1.08), Mn (0.12), Mo (0.01), Na (697), Ni (0.11), Pb (0.04), Sr (1.45), V (0.01), and Zn (4.69). The mean concentrations of Cr, K, and Mg (0.14, 1,904, and 243 mg/kg wet wt, respectively) were higher in muscle than in liver (0.05, 1,333 and 236 mg/kg wet wt, respectively). The mean concentrations of Cd and Pb (0.01 and 0.04 mg/kg wet wt) in muscle did not exceed the maximum limits established by a European Commission regulation (0.1 mg of Cd/kg and 0.3 mg of Pb/kg, respectively). Considering a mean daily consumption of fish muscle for the adult population of 31.9 g/day published in the report on food consumption by the Spanish Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Food and Environment, Mg made the highest contributions to the intake (2.58% for adult women of 60 kg and 2.22% for men of 70 kg), and the estimated intakes of Al (0.35 to 0.46 mg/day), Cd (0.55 to 0.74 mg/day) and Pb (1.66 to 5.53 mg/day) were below the respective established tolerable intakes. In conclusion, the results of this study show that the consumption of muscle from this benthopelagic species can be considered safe in terms of maximum legal limits, while consumption of liver is discouraged as a major source of exposure to toxic metals, such as Al, Cd, and Pb.","['Dietary intake', 'Inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry', 'Liver', 'Metals', 'Muscle', 'Trachurus picturatus']"
Comparison of hypertension healthcare outcomes among older people in the USA and England.,"The USA and England have very different health systems. Comparing hypertension care outcomes in each country enables an evaluation of the effectiveness of each system.The English Longitudinal Study of Ageing and the Health and Retirement Survey are used to compare the prevalence of controlled, uncontrolled and undiagnosed hypertension within the hypertensive population (diagnosed or measured within the survey data used) aged 50 years and above in the USA and in England.Controlled hypertension is more prevalent within the hypertensive population in the USA (age 50-64: 0.53 (0.50 to 0.57) and age 65+: 0.51 (0.49 to 0.53)) than in England (age 50-64: 0.45 (0.42 to 0.48) and age 65+: 0.42 (0.40 to 0.45)). This difference is driven by lower undiagnosed hypertension in the USA (age 50-64: 0.18 (0.15-0.21) and age 65+: 0.13 (0.12 to 0.14)) relative to England (age 50-64: 0.26 (0.24 to 0.29) and age 65+: 0.22 (0.20 to 0.24)). The prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension within the hypertensive population is very similar in the USA (age 50-64: 0.29 (0.26 to 0.32) and age 65+: 0.36 (0.34 to 0.38)) and England (age 50-64: 0.29 (0.26 to 0.32) and age 65+: 0.36 (0.34 to 0.39)). Hypertension care outcomes are comparable across US insurance categories. In both countries, undiagnosed hypertension is positively correlated with wealth (ages 50-64). Uncontrolled hypertension declines with rising wealth in the USA.Different diagnostic practices are likely to drive the cross-country differences in undiagnosed hypertension. US government health systems perform at least as well as private healthcare and are more equitable in the distribution of care outcomes. Higher undiagnosed hypertension among the affluent may reflect less frequent medical contact.","['ACCESS TO HLTH CARE', 'Health inequalities', 'PUBLIC HEALTH']"
System-dependent image distortion related to gantry positions of a 0.35 T MRgRT: Characterization and the corresponding correction.,"MR-guided radiotherapy with high accuracy treatment planning requires addressing MR imaging artifacts that originate from system imperfections. This work presents the characterization and corresponding correction of gantry-related imaging distortions including geometric distortion and isocenter shift in a 0.35 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided radiotherapy (MRgRT) system using distortion vector fields (DVFs).Two phantoms, the magnetic resonance imaging distortion in 3D (MRID<sup>3D</sup> ) phantom and the Fluke phantom, along with a human volunteer were imaged at different gantry angles on a 0.35 T MR-Linac. The geometric distortion and isocenter shift were characterized for both phantom images. DVFs with a field of view extended beyond the physical boundary of the MRID<sup>3D</sup> phantom were extracted from images taken at 30° gantry angle increments, with vendor-provided distortion correction turned on and off (DstOff). These extended DVFs were then applied to the relevant phantom images to correct their geometric distortions and isocenter shift at the respective gantry angles. The extended DVFs produced from the MRID<sup>3D</sup> phantom were also applied to Fluke phantom and human MR images at their respective gantry angles. The resampled images were evaluated using structural similarity index measure (SSIM) comparison with the vendor corrected images from the MRgRT system.Geometric distortion with ""mean (± SD) distortion"" of 3.2 ± 0.02, 2.9 ± 0.02, and 1.8 ± 0.01 mm and isocenter shift (±SD) of 0.49 ± 0.3, 0.05 ± 0.2, and 0.01 ± 0.03 mm were present in the DstOff MRID<sup>3D</sup> phantom images in right-left (RL), anterior-posterior (AP), and superior-inferior (SI) directions, respectively. After resampling the originally acquired images by applying extended DVFs, the distortion was corrected to 0.18 ± 0.02, 0.09 ± 0.01, 0.15 ± 0.01 mm, and isocenter shift was corrected to 0.14 ± 0.05, -0.02 ± 0.04, and -0.07 ± 0.05 mm in RL, AP, and SI directions, respectively. The Fluke phantom average geometric distortion with ""mean (± SD) distortion"" of 2.7 ± 0.1 mm was corrected to 0.2 ± 0. 1 mm and the average isocenter shift (± SD) of 0.51 ± 0.2 mm, and 0.05 ± 0.03 was corrected to -0.08 ± 0.03 mm, and -0.05 ± 0.01 in RL and AP directions, respectively. SSIM (mean ± SD) of the original images to resampled images was increased from 0.49 ± 0.02 to 0.78 ± 0.01, 0.45 ± 0.02 to 0.75 ± 0.01, and 0.86 ± 0.25 to 0.98 ± 0.08 for MRID<sup>3D</sup> phantom, Fluke phantom, and human MR images, respectively, for all the gantry angles compared to the vendor corrected images.The gantry-related MR imaging distortion including geometric distortion and isocenter shift was characterized and a corresponding correction was demonstrated using extended DVFs on 0.35 T MRgRT system. The characterized gantry-related isocenter shift can be combined with geometric distortion correction to provide a technique for the correction of the full system-dependent distortion in an MRgRT system.","['MRguided radiotherapy', 'distortion correction', 'geometric image distortion']"
Inverse Association between Metformin and Amiodarone-Associated Extracardiac Adverse Events.,"<b>Background:</b> The association between metformin and amiodarone-induced adverse events was examined using spontaneous adverse event database. Additionally, the association between other antidiabetic drugs and amiodarone-induced adverse events were also examined. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 6,153,696 reports from the first quarter of 2004 through the fourth quarter of 2015 were downloaded from the US Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting system. Reporting odds ratio (ROR) and information component (IC) were used to detect associations between antidiabetic drugs and amiodarone-associated adverse events. Additionally, subset data analysis was performed to investigate whether the use of antidiabetic drugs further increased or decreased the risk of adverse events in patients receiving amiodarone therapy. Next, the RORs were adjusted for coadministered antidiabetic drugs using logistic regression analysis. <b>Results:</b> By whole dataset analysis, significant inverse associations were found between metformin and interstitial lung disease (ROR 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.79-0.90; IC -0.24, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.15). In the subset data analysis, metformin (ROR 0.62, 95%CI 0.43-0.89; IC -0.63, 95%CI -1.14 to -0.11), sulfonylureas (ROR 0.53, 95%CI 0.32-0.85; IC -0.85, 95%CI -1.53 to -0.17), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (ROR 0.25, 95%CI 0.08-0.78; IC -1.66, 95%CI -3.08 to -0.23) were inversely associated with hyperthyroidism. Additionally, metformin (ROR 0.43, 95%CI 0.33-0.57; IC -1.09, 95%CI -1.49 to -0.69), sulfonylureas (ROR 0.64, 95%CI 0.48-0.86; IC -0.59, 95%CI -1.00 to -0.17), and DPP-4 inhibitors (ROR 0.47, 95%CI 0.27-0.81; IC -0.99, 95%CI -1.76 to -0.22) were inversely associated with interstitial lung disease. In the logistic regression analyses, DPP-4 inhibitors (adjusted ROR 0.32, 95% CI 0.10-1.00) and metformin (adjusted ROR 0.46, 95% CI 0.34-0.62) were inversely associated with amiodarone-associated hyperthyroidism and interstitial lung disease, respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> Metformin is a candidate drug to reduce the risk of amiodarone-induced hyperthyroidism and interstitial lung disease.","['Food and Drug Administration adverse event reporting system', 'adverse event', 'amiodarone', 'antidiabetic drug', 'metformin']"
Genetic correlations between meat quality traits and growth and carcass traits in Merino sheep1.,"Genetic correlations between 16 meat quality and nutritional value traits and live weight at various ages, live ultrasound fat and muscle depth, carcass measures, and carcass dissection traits were estimated for Merino sheep in the Information Nucleus (IN). Genetic correlations between live weight at various ages and the carcass traits are also reported. The IN comprised 8 genetically linked flocks managed across a range of Australian sheep environments. Meat quality traits included between 1,200 and 1,300 records for progeny from over 170 sires for intramuscular fat (IMF), lean meat yield (LMY), shear force (SF5), pH, meat color, and meat nutritional value traits including iron and zinc levels and long-chain omega-3 and omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid levels. The genetic correlations indicated that selection of Merino sheep to either reduce fat or increase muscle using ultrasound assessments will result in little change in IMF and SF5. Myoglobin levels would tend to be reduced following selection for reduced ultrasound fat depth (0.35 ± 0.21, 0.43 ± 0.14), whereas increases in myoglobin levels would occur due to selection for increased ultrasound muscle depth (0.25 ± 0.24, 0.38 ± 0.15). Selection for increased live weight will result in favorable correlated responses in hot carcass weight (0.76 to 0.97), dressing percentage (0.13 to 0.47), and carcass muscle (0.37 to 0.95), but unfavorable responses of increases in carcass fatness (0.13 to 0.65) and possible small reductions in muscle oxidative activity (-0.13 ± 0.14 to -0.73 ± 0.33) and iron content (-0.14 ± 0.15 to -0.38 ± 0.16), and a possible deterioration of shear force from selection at later ages (0.15 ± 0.26, 0.27 ± 0.24). Negligible changes are generally expected for LMY and meat color traits following selection for increased live weight (most genetic correlations less than 0.20 in size). Selection for increased LMY would tend to result in unfavorable changes in several aspects of meat quality, including reduced IMF (-0.27 ± 0.18), meat tenderness (0.53 ± 0.26), and meat redness (-0.69 ± 0.40), as well as reduced iron levels (-0.25 ± 0.22). These genetic correlations are a first step in assisting the development of breeding values for new traits to be incorporated into genetic evaluation programs to improve meat production from Merino sheep and other dual-purpose sheep breeds.","['Merino sheep', 'carcass', 'genetic correlations', 'growth', 'meat quality', 'nutritional value']"
Understanding Cognitive Deficits in People with High Blood Pressure.,"High blood pressure is associated with an elevated risk of dementia. However, much less is known about how high blood pressure is related to cognitive deficits in domains including episodic memory, semantic verbal fluency, fluid reasoning, and numerical ability. By analyzing data from 337 participants (57.39% female) with a history of clinical high blood pressure diagnosis with a mean age of 48.78 ± 17.06 years and 26,707 healthy controls (58.75% female) with a mean age of 45.30 ± 15.92 years using a predictive normative modeling approach and one-sample t-tests, the current study found that people with high blood pressure have impaired immediate (t(259) = -4.71, <i>p</i> < 0.01, Cohen's d = -0.08, 95% C.I. [-0.11, -0.05]) and delayed word recall (t(259) = -7.21, <i>p</i> < 0.01, Cohen's d = -0.11, 95% C.I. [-0.15, -0.08]) performance. Moreover, people with high blood pressure also exhibited impaired performance in the animal naming task (t(259) = -6.61, <i>p</i> < 0.0001, Cohen's d = -0.11, 95% C.I. [-0.15, -0.08]), and number series (t(259) = -4.76, <i>p</i> < 0.01, Cohen's d = -0.08, 95% C.I. [-0.11, -0.05]) and numeracy tasks (t(259) = -4.16, <i>p</i> < 0.01, Cohen's d = -0.06, 95% C.I. [-0.09, -0.03]) after controlling for demographic characteristics. Clinicians and health professionals should consider including these tasks as part of the neuropsychological assessment for people with high blood pressure, to detect their cognitive deficits. Moreover, they should also come up with ways to improve cognitive performance in people with high blood pressure.","['cognitive deficits', 'cognitive performance', 'dementia', 'high blood pressures']"
Gels as adjuvant to non-surgical periodontal therapy: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effect of the use of available drugs loaded gels used as adjunct to non-surgical periodontal therapy.Systematic research on PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Central register of Controlled Trials, and Embase databases up to December 2021 was performed. Randomized clinical trials (RCT) which compared the outcomes of scaling and root planing (SRP) + local adjuvant administration (gel) versus SRP + placebo or SRP alone in Humans were included. The primary outcome measures were PPD and CAL changes at 3 months.After articles screening, 77 articles were included and assessed for quality. Then, a meta-analysis was conducted in studies with at least 3 months of follow-up. Clinical improvements were found to be significant for tetracyclines (-0.51 [-0.71;-0.31] <i>p</i> < 0.001), macrolides (-0.71 [-1.04;-0.38] p < 0.001), statins (-0.84 [-0.98;-0.70] <i>p</i> < 0.001), metformin (-1.47 [-1.66;-1.29] <i>p</i> < 0.001) and hyaluronan (-1.61 [-2.28;-0.94] <i>p</i> < 0.001) loaded gels, but non-significant for chlorhexidine (-0.48 [-1.10; 0.14] <i>p</i> = 0.13), metronidazole (-0.50 [-1.20; 0.20] <i>p</i> = 0.16) and bisphosphonates (-0.42 [-1.39; 0.54] <i>p</i> = 0.539) gels.Adjunctive use of drugs loaded gels to non-surgical periodondal treatment could improve PPD reduction at 3 months. However, huge disparities remain when comparing the outcomes of the differents drugs used. Future comparative studies should be considered to determine precisely short and long term benefits of such treatments.","['Hydrogels', 'Local delivery', 'Nonsurgical treatment', 'Periodontitis', 'Root planing', 'Scaling']"
Differences in tumour characteristics of Hepatocellular Carcinoma between patients with and without Cirrhosis: A population-based study.,"<b>Background:</b> Liver cirrhosis is a major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, 10%-20% of patients with HCC do not have cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to explore the potential differences in tumour characteristics of HCC between patients with and without cirrhosis. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, we identified total 10,849 patients with HCC diagnosed between 2010 and 2016, from the SEER database. The degree of fibrosis was categorized as ""no cirrhosis"" (Ishak score 0-4) or ""cirrhosis"" (Ishak score 5-6). Among all patients with HCC, patients with no cirrhosis and with cirrhosis accounted for 1800 (16.6%) and 9049 (83.4%), respectively. <b>Results:</b> Significant negative correlations were observed between no cirrhosis/cirrhosis and pathological grade (r =-0.074, P <0.001), tumour size (r =-0.186, P <0.001), N stage (r =-0.024, P =0.025), M stage (r =-0.036, P <0.001), liver metastasis (r =-0.024, P =0.014), and lung metastasis (r =-0.027, P =0.006). Logistic multivariate regression analysis showed that, compared with cirrhosis, no cirrhosis is an independent risk predictor of pathological grade [odds ratio (OR), 0.685; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.571-0.822; P < 0.001], tumour size (OR, 0.392; 95% CI, 0.351-0.437; P < 0.001), N stage (OR, 0.704; 95% CI, 0.561-0.883; P < 0.001), and M stage (OR, 0.671; 95% CI, 0.561-0.804; P < 0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> Compared with cirrhosis, no cirrhosis is significantly associated with worse pathological grade, larger tumour size, and more lymph node and distant metastases. Patients without cirrhosis that are otherwise neglected in HCC clinical practice require intensive focus in future studies.","['Cirrhosis', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'metastasis', 'pathological grade', 'tumour size']"
Determinants of Home Discharge Among Survivors of Necrotizing Fasciitis: A Population-Level Analysis.,"The majority of patients with necrotizing fasciitis (NF) in the United Sates survive their illness, and there is increasing interest in addressing the ability of survivors to return to their community following hospitalization. However, there are no data on the factors affecting home discharge among survivors of NF.We used the Texas Inpatient Public Use Data File to conduct a retrospective population-based examination of hospitalizations with NF aged 15 years or older between 2001 and 2010. Multivariate logistic regression modeling was used to explore predictors of home discharge among hospital survivors.There were 10,724 NF hospitalizations surviving to discharge during study period, of which 62.5% were discharged home. The following key predictors have adversely affected odds of home discharge (odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals): age ≥ 75 years (0.349 (0.292 - 0.417)), Medicare insurance (0.582 (0.510 - 0.663)), congestive heart failure (0.836 (0.719 - 0.972)), chronic liver disease (0.684 (0.522 - 0.895)), respiratory failure (0.464 (0.386 - 0.558)), neurological failure (0.573 (0.418 - 0.787)), and need for mechanical ventilation (0.339 (0.199 - 0.578)). Increased odds of home discharge were found among males (1.116 (1.058 - 1.285)), Hispanics (1.193 (1.056 - 1.349)), those lacking health insurance (2.161 (1.183 - 2.521)) or managed at a teaching hospital (1.264 (1.127 - 1.418)).In this first population-level examination of the determinants of home discharge among survivors of NF, older age, Medicare insurance, selected comorbidities, and development of organ failure decreased patients' odds of home discharge. Unexpectedly, male gender, Hispanic ethnicity, lack of health insurance, and being managed at a teaching hospital were associated with favorable impact on patients' discharge disposition. Further studies are warranted in other populations and healthcare environments to corroborate the present findings and to refine our understanding of the factors affecting short-term outcomes among NF survivors.","['Health insurance', 'Hospital disposition', 'Necrotizing fasciitis', 'Organ failure', 'Outcomes']"
"The impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on pediatric hospitalization in Kitami, Japan.","Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has drastically changed the recommended activities and environment for patients worldwide. Our aim was to assess the impact of COVID-19 on pediatric hospitalizations in Kitami, Japan.A retrospective, single-center study was conducted on hospitalized patients aged 0-14 years at the Japanese Red Cross Kitami Hospital. We compared the incidence of pediatric patients hospitalized in 2020 with those in 2017-2019.The number of pediatric hospitalized patients dropped significantly in 2020 compared to that in 2017-2019 (median 43.0 vs 78.5 per month, P < 0.001). The patients were significantly older in 2020 (4.3 vs 3.4 years, P < 0.001). Hospitalization from respiratory (8.5 vs 30.5, P < 0.001) and gastrointestinal infections (3.0 vs 6.0, P = 0.004) significantly decreased. Admission due to respiratory syncytial virus (0.0 vs 4.0, P < 0.001), human metapneumovirus (0.0 vs 1.0, P = 0.005), influenza (0.0 vs 0.0, P = 0.009), adenovirus (0.0 vs 1.0, P = 0.003), and rotavirus infection (0.0 vs 0.0, P = 0.025) also decreased significantly. The <1-5 age groups significantly decreased (<1 year old, 6.5 vs 12.5, P < 0.001; 1-3 years old, 13.0 vs 29.5, P < 0.001; 4-5 years old, 5.5 vs 11.5, P < 0.001). Hospitalization due to foreign body ingestions increased significantly in 2020 (1.0 vs 0.0, P = 0.010).The COVID-19 control measures inadvertently reduced the number of hospitalized pediatric patients, especially younger children with respiratory and gastrointestinal infections.","['coronavirus', 'epidemiology', 'foreign body ingestion', 'gastrointestinal infection', 'respiratory infection']"
Contributions of social determinants of health to systolic blood pressure in United States adult immigrants: Use of path analysis to validate a conceptual framework.,"Validate a conceptual framework and identify pathways between antecedent (life-course socioeconomic status (L-SES)), predisposing (age, sex, married, homeless as a child), enabling (health literacy, acculturation), and need (disability) social determinants of health (SDoH) and systolic blood pressure (SBP) in US immigrants.181 immigrants were enrolled in the study. Path analysis was used to identify paths by which SDoH influence SBP and to determine if antecedents, predisposing, enabling, and need factors have direct and indirect relationships with SBP.The final model(chi<sup>2</sup>(5)=14.88, p = 0.011, RMSEA = 0.070, pclose = 0.17, CFI = 0.96) showed L-SES was directly associated with age (0.12, p = 0.019) and disability(0.17, p = 0.001); and indirectly associated with disability (0.29, p < 0.001) and SBP (0.31, p < 0.001). Age (0.31, p < 0.001) and sex(0.25, p < 0.001) were directly associated with SBP, and age was directly associated with disability (0.29, p < 0.001) and indirectly associated with SBP(0.14, p = 0.018). Other predisposing factors such as being married (-0.32, p < 0.001) and being homeless as a child alone (0.16, p < 0.001) were directly associated with disability and indirectly associated (0.14, p = 0.018) with SBP. Enabling factor of health literacy (0.16, p = 0.001) was directly associated with disability and indirectly associated (0.14, p = 0.018) with SBP. Need factor of disability (0.14, p = 0.018) was directly associated with SBP.This study provides the first validation of a conceptual model for the relationship between SDoH and SBP among immigrants and identifies potential targets for focused interventions.","['Social determinants', 'blood pressure', 'immigrant']"
Effects of Acute and Chronic Exercises on Executive Function in Children and Adolescents: A Systemic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"<b>Background:</b> Physical exercises can affect executive function both acutely and chronically, with different mechanisms for each moment. Currently, only a few reviews have elaborated on the premise that different types of exercises have different mechanisms for improving executive function. Therefore, the primary purpose of our systematic review was to analyze the effects of acute and chronic exercises on executive function in children and adolescents. <b>Objective:</b> We identified acute and chronic exercise studies and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of executive function in children and adolescents that reported overall effect, heterogeneity, and publication bias of acute and chronic exercises on executive function. <b>Methods:</b> We searched for RCTs of exercise interventions in children and adolescents from databases including PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, The Cochrane Library, CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), and Wanfang, from January 1 2009 to December 31 2019. We performed methodological quality evaluations on the included literature using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale (PEDro) and graded evidence with a meta-analysis using Stata 12.0 software. <b>Results:</b> In total, 36 RCTs were included (14 acute exercises, 22 chronic exercises); the overall results of the meta-analysis (4,577 students) indicated that acute exercises significantly improved working memory (standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.72; 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.89 to -0.56; <i>p</i> < 0.001), inhibitory control (SMD = -0.25; 95% CI -0.40 to -0.09; <i>p</i> = 0.002), and cognitive flexibility (SMD = -0.34; 95% CI -0.55 to -0.14; <i>p</i> < 0.005), whereas chronic exercises significantly improved working memory (SMD = -0.54; 95% CI -0.74 to -0.33; <i>p</i> < 0.001), inhibitory control (SMD = -0.30; 95% CI -0.38 to -0.22; <i>p</i> < 0.001), and cognitive flexibility (SMD = -0.34, 95 % CI -0.48 to -0.20, <i>p</i> < 0.001). <b>Conclusion:</b> Acute and chronic exercises can effectively improve the executive function of children and adolescents. The effects on inhibitory control and cognitive flexibility are considered as small effect sizes, while the effects on working memory are considered as moderate effect size. Limited by the quantity and quality of the included studies, the above conclusions need to be verified with more high-quality studies.","['acute exercise', 'adolescents', 'chronic exercise', 'cognitive', 'executive function']"
Articular cartilage surface roughness as an imaging-based morphological indicator of osteoarthritis: A preliminary investigation of osteoarthritis initiative subjects.,"Current imaging-based morphometric indicators of osteoarthritis (OA) using whole-compartment mean cartilage thickness (MCT) and volume changes can be insensitive to mild degenerative changes of articular cartilage (AC) due to areas of adjacent thickening and thinning. The purpose of this preliminary study was to evaluate cartilage thickness-based surface roughness as a morphometric indicator of OA. 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets were collected from osteoarthritis initiative (OAI) subjects with Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) OA grades of 0, 2, and 4 (n = 10/group). Femoral and tibial AC volumes were converted to two-dimensional thickness maps, and MCT, arithmetic surface roughness (S<sub>a</sub> ), and anatomically normalized S<sub>a</sub> (normS<sub>a</sub> ) were calculated. Thickness maps enabled visualization of degenerative changes with increasing KL grade, including adjacent thinning and thickening on the femoral condyles. No significant differences were observed in MCT between KL grades. S<sub>a</sub> was significantly higher in KL4 compared to KL0 and KL2 in the whole femur (KL0: 0.55 ± 0.10 mm, KL2: 0.53 ± 0.09 mm, KL4: 0.79 ± 0.18 mm), medial femoral condyle (KL0: 0.42 ± 0.07 mm, KL2: 0.48 ± 0.07 mm, KL4: 0.76 ± 0.22 mm), and medial tibial plateau (KL0: 0.42 ± 0.07 mm, KL2: 0.43 ± 0.09 mm, KL4: 0.68 ± 0.27 mm). normS<sub>a</sub> was significantly higher in KL4 compared to KL0 and KL2 in the whole femur (KL0: 0.22 ± 0.02, KL2: 0.22 ± 0.02, KL4: 0.30 ± 0.03), medial condyle (KL0: 0.17 ± 0.02, KL2: 0.20 ± 0.03, KL4: 0.29 ± 0.06), whole tibia (KL0: 0.34 ± 0.04, KL2: 0.33 ± 0.05, KL4: 0.48 ± 0.11) and medial plateau (KL0: 0.23 ± 0.03, KL2: 0.24 ± 0.04, KL4: 0.40 ± 0.10), and significantly higher in KL2 compared to KL0 in the medial femoral condyle. Surface roughness metrics were sensitive to degenerative morphologic changes, and may be useful in OA characterization and early diagnosis. © 2017 Orthopaedic Research Society.

Estimation of social genetic effects on feeding behaviour and production traits in pigs.,"Pigs are housed in groups during the test period. Social effects between pen mates may affect average daily gain (ADG), backfat thickness (BF), feed conversion rate (FCR), and the feeding behaviour traits of pigs sharing the same pen. The aim of our study was to estimate the genetic parameters of feeding behaviour and production traits with statistical models that include social genetic effects (SGEs). The data contained 3075 Finnish Yorkshire, 3351 Finnish Landrace, and 968 F1-crossbred pigs. Feeding behaviour traits were measured as the number of visits per day (NVD), time spent in feeding per day (TPD), daily feed intake (DFI), time spent in feeding per visit (TPV), feed intake per visit (FPV), and feed intake rate (FR). The test period was divided into five periods of 20 days. The number of pigs per pen varied from 8 to 12. Two model approaches were tested, i.e. a fixed group size model and a variable group size model. For the fixed group size model, eight random pigs per pen were included in the analysis, while all pigs in a pen were included for the variable group size model. The linear mixed-effects model included sex, breed, and herd*year*season as fixed effects and group (batch*pen), litter, the animal itself (direct genetic effect (DGE)), and pen mates (SGEs) as random effects. For feeding behaviour traits, estimates of the total heritable variation (T<sup>2</sup>± SE) and classical heritability (h<sup>2</sup>± SE, values given in brackets) from the variable group size model (e.g. period 1) were 0.34 ± 0.13 (0.30 ± 0.04) for NVD, 0.41 ± 0.10 (0.37 ± 0.04) for TPD, 0.40 ± 0.15 (0.14 ± 0.03) for DFI, 0.53 ± 0.15 (0.28 ± 0.04) for TPV, 0.66 ± 0.17 (0.28 ± 0.04) for FPV, and 0.29 ± 0.13 (0.22 ± 0.03) for FR. The effect of social interaction was minimal for ADG (T<sup>2</sup> = 0.29 ± 0.11 and h<sup>2</sup> = 0.29 ± 0.04), BF (T<sup>2</sup> = 0.48 ± 0.12 and h<sup>2</sup> = 0.38 ± 0.07), and FCR (T<sup>2</sup> = 0.37 ± 0.12 and h<sup>2</sup> = 0.29 ± 0.04) using the variable group size model. In conclusion, the results indicate that social interactions have a considerable indirect genetic effect on the feeding behaviour and FCR of pigs but not on ADG and BF.","['Feed conversion rate', 'Heritability', 'Indirect genetic effect', 'Social interaction', 'Swine']"
A slice classification model-facilitated 3D encoder-decoder network for segmenting organs at risk in head and neck cancer.,"For deep learning networks used to segment organs at risk (OARs) in head and neck (H&N) cancers, the class-imbalance problem between small volume OARs and whole computed tomography (CT) images results in delineation with serious false-positives on irrelevant slices and unnecessary time-consuming calculations. To alleviate this problem, a slice classification model-facilitated 3D encoder-decoder network was developed and validated. In the developed two-step segmentation model, a slice classification model was firstly utilized to classify CT slices into six categories in the craniocaudal direction. Then the target categories for different OARs were pushed to the different 3D encoder-decoder segmentation networks, respectively. All the patients were divided into training (n = 120), validation (n = 30) and testing (n = 20) datasets. The average accuracy of the slice classification model was 95.99%. The Dice similarity coefficient and 95% Hausdorff distance, respectively, for each OAR were as follows: right eye (0.88 ± 0.03 and 1.57 ± 0.92 mm), left eye (0.89 ± 0.03 and 1.35 ± 0.43 mm), right optic nerve (0.72 ± 0.09 and 1.79 ± 1.01 mm), left optic nerve (0.73 ± 0.09 and 1.60 ± 0.71 mm), brainstem (0.87 ± 0.04 and 2.28 ± 0.99 mm), right temporal lobe (0.81 ± 0.12 and 3.28 ± 2.27 mm), left temporal lobe (0.82 ± 0.09 and 3.73 ± 2.08 mm), right temporomandibular joint (0.70 ± 0.13 and 1.79 ± 0.79 mm), left temporomandibular joint (0.70 ± 0.16 and 1.98 ± 1.48 mm), mandible (0.89 ± 0.02 and 1.66 ± 0.51 mm), right parotid (0.77 ± 0.07 and 7.30 ± 4.19 mm) and left parotid (0.71 ± 0.12 and 8.41 ± 4.84 mm). The total segmentation time was 40.13 s. The 3D encoder-decoder network facilitated by the slice classification model demonstrated superior performance in accuracy and efficiency in segmenting OARs in H&N CT images. This may significantly reduce the workload for radiation oncologists.","['automatic segmentation', 'deep learning', 'head and neck', 'organs at risk', 'radiotherapy']"
Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy in Cirrhotic Patients: A Retrospective Study.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Cirrhosis is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality around the world. Although cirrhotic patients are considered to have a higher risk for surgical procedures than non-cirrhotic ones, there are certain pathologies such as gallstones cholecystitis that cannot be treated otherwise. The focus of this study is to evaluate the main characteristics of the patients with lithiasic cholecystitis and liver cirrhosis and to assess if there is a correlation between them and postoperative morbidity evaluated with Dindo-Clavien classification. Material and <b>Methods:</b> This is a retrospective study. The database from General Surgery Department of Fundeni Clinical Institute was queried between 2014-2018 using as key words ""cirrhosis"" and ""cholecystitis"". The initial interrogation reveled 57 cases out of which 3 were excluded since other resections were associated. <b>Results:</b> This study identified that Dindo-Clavien classification positively correlates with the open approach (0.405, p=0.002), emergency surgery (0.599, p=0.000), acute cholecystitis (0.476, p=0.000), high MELD score (0.291, p=0.008) and Child score (0.346, p=0.007) and furthermore with high levels of total bilirubin (0.220, p=0.047), high INR (0.286, p=0.010), the presence of ascites (0.303, p=0.022) and portal hypertension (0.266, p=0.044). It also correlates negatively with the levels of hemoglobin (-0.295, p=0.044). Conclusion: Adequate estimation of perioperative mortality and morbidity is generally limited by the retrospective nature of most studies and the patient's selection criteria. Emergency surgery, acute cholecystitis and the open approach carry the highest risk for unfavorable results of cholecystectomy in cirrhotic patients.","['ChildPugh', 'MELD', 'cholecystitis', 'cirrhosis', 'laparoscopy']"
Determinants of inspiratory muscle function in healthy children.,"Children are affected by disorders that have an impact on the respiratory muscles. Inspiratory muscle function can be assessed by means of the noninvasive tension-time index of the inspiratory muscles (TTI<sub>mus</sub>). Our objectives were to identify the determinants of TTI<sub>mus</sub> in healthy children and to report normal values of TTI<sub>mus</sub> in this population.We measured weight, height, upper arm muscle area (UAMA), and TTI<sub>mus</sub> in 96 children aged 6-18 years. The level and frequency of aerobic activity was assessed by questionnaire.TTI<sub>mus</sub> was significantly lower in male subjects (0.095 ± 0.038, mean ± SD) compared with female subjects (0.126 ± 0.056) (<i>p</i> = 0.002). TTI<sub>mus</sub> was significantly lower in regularly exercising (0.093 ± 0.040) compared with nonexercising subjects (0.130 ± 0.053) (<i>p</i> < 0.001). TTI<sub>mus</sub> was significantly negatively related to age (<i>r</i> = -0.239, <i>p</i> = 0.019), weight (<i>r</i> = -0.214, <i>p</i> = 0.037), height (<i>r</i> = -0.355, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and UAMA (<i>r</i> = -0.222, <i>p</i> = 0.030). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that height and aerobic exercise were significantly related to TTI<sub>mus</sub> independently of age, weight, and UAMA. The predictive regression equation for TTI<sub>mus</sub> in male subjects was TTI<sub>mus</sub> = 0.228 - 0.001 × height (cm), and in female subjects it was TTI<sub>mus</sub> = 0.320 - 0.001 × height (cm) .Gender, age, anthropometry, skeletal muscularity, and aerobic exercise are significantly associated with indices of inspiratory muscle function in children. Normal values of TTI<sub>mus</sub> in healthy children are reported.","['Aerobic exercise', 'Children', 'Inspiratory muscle function', 'Maximal inspiratory pressure', 'Skeletal muscle function', 'Tension–time index of the inspiratory muscles']"
Axial Length Shortening After Cataract Surgery: New Approach to Solve the Question.,"To check if optical biometry can detect eventual corneal power (Km) and axial length (AL) cataract surgery-related changes that could influence the refractive outcome.Patients scheduled for sequential bilateral cataract surgery between January and September 2017 were included in the present study. One hundred ninety-six eyes of 98 patients (48 males) were selected. Before surgery of the first eye, patients underwent a complete ophthalmic examination, including IOLMaster biometry; the same evaluations were repeated in both eyes the day before the fellow eye cataract surgery, performed at least 2 months after the first one. The differences in Km and AL in the first operated eyes were evaluated, and the fellow eyes were used as controls.Km differences in the operated eyes ranged from -1.97 to +0.98 diopter (D) (mean = -0.02 ± 0.36 D) (<i>P</i> = 0.89); in the nonoperated eyes they ranged from -0.6 to +0.7 D (mean = 0 ± 0.20 D) (<i>P</i> = 0.91). The AL differences (pseudophakic option) in the operated eyes ranged from -0.35 to +0.15 mm (mean = -0.10 ± 0.08 mm) (<i>P</i> < 0.001); with the aphakic option they ranged from -0.24 to + 0.26 mm (mean = 0.01 ± 0.08 mm) (<i>P</i>= 0.38). In the nonoperated eyes, the AL differences ranged from -0.04 to +0.06 mm (mean= 0 ± 0.02 mm) (<i>P</i> = 0.02).The modern phaco-technique seems not to induce changes in Km and AL, supporting the hypothesis that the differences in AL are due to an incorrect estimation in pseudophakic eyes.The results of our study may improve the AL measurements in pseudophakic eyes.","['axial length', 'cataract surgery', 'corneal power', 'partial coherence interferometry']"
"The impact of socioeconomic status, general health and oral health on Health-Related Quality of Life, Oral Health-Related Quality of Life and mental health among Polish older adults.","The study aims to evaluate the impact of socioeconomic status, general health and oral health parameters on Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), Oral Health-Related Quality of Life (OHRQoL) and mental health in elderly urban residents of South-Western Poland.The 500 residents of Wroclaw, aged 65 and older provided demographic and personal information as well as their medical history. A patient's oral condition were determined based on the clinical oral examination.Quality of Life was assessed using Euro-Quality of Life (EQ-5D), Oral Health Impact Profile-14 (OHIP-14) and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).The association between exposure (socioeconomic status, general health and oral health) and outcome (HRQoL, OHRQoL and mental health variables) were analyzed with the use of four models: P - Poisson model, NB-Negative Binomial model, ZIP - Zero Inflated Poisson model, ZINB - Zero Inflated Negative Binomial model.The best model turned out to be the ZINB model, in which a negative binomial distribution in the count equation is assumed. In this model, only 13 independent variables had a significant effect on HRQoL, OHRQoL, and mental health. HRQoL assessed with the EQ-5D is significantly influenced by: living conditions 0.133 (95% CI: 0.001, 0.267, p = 0.049), income -0.348 (95%CI: -0.466, -0.230, p < 0.001), diabetes mellitus 0.437 (95%CI: 0.250, 0.624, p < 0.001), myocardial infarction 0.454 (95% CI: 0.151, 0.757, p = 0.003), stroke 0.543 (95%CI: 0.094, 0.992, p = 0.018) and renal disease 0.466 (95% CI: 0.206, 0.726, p < 0.001). Factors negatively affecting OHRQOL are: the need for oral treatment 0.278 (95%CI: 0.104, 0.452, p = 0.002), the number of missing teeth 0.053 (95%CI: 0.039, 0.067, p < 0.001) and gender 0.271 (95%CI: 0.015, 0.527, p = 0.038) and age -0.025 (95%CI: -0.042, -0.008, p = 0.003). An important factor influencing the level of depression assessed by the PHQ-9 questionnaire may be the material condition -0.225 (95%CI: -0.349, -0.101, p < 0.001). It should be emphasized that living with other people may be a factor that significantly increases the probability of avoiding the occurrence of depression symptoms.The study concerning elderly residents of the macroregion in Poland found the impact of socioeconomic, general health and oral health parameters on Health-Related Quality of Life, Oral Health-Related Quality of Life and mental health. Research on the quality of life of the elderly at the local level allowed to assess the factors linked to quality of life of older adults.","['EQ5D', 'Elderly', 'OHIP14', 'Oral Health Impact Profile 14', 'PHQ9', 'Quality of Life']"
Efficacy and safety evaluation of dexmedetomidine for postoperative patient controlled intravenous analgesia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine (DEX) for postoperative patient controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA). <b>Measurements:</b> Two investigators independently searched Pubmed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane Library and CBM for randomized controlled trials of DEX for PCIA. <b>Main results:</b> Thirty-seven studies with a total of 5,409 patients were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with analgesics alone, DEX for PCIA reduced pain score at 24 h [mean difference (MD) = -0.70; 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.85, -0.54; <i>p</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 90%] and 48 h postoperatively (MD = -0.43; 95% CI: -0.52, -0.34; <i>p</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 96%). Moreover, DEX reduced analgesics consumption during the first 24 h [standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.25; 95% CI: -0.34, -0.16; <i>p</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 91%] and the number of resuscitation analgesics administered [odds ratio (OR) = 0.54; 95% CI: 0.44, 0.66; <i>p</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 72%]. Furthermore, DEX improved patient satisfaction (OR = 3.55; 95% CI: 2.36, 5.35; <i>p</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 60%), and reduced incidence of side effects, such as postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) (OR = 0.47; 95% CI: 0.39, 0.57; <i>p</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 59%) and pruritus after surgery (OR = 0.45; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.68; <i>p</i> = 0.0001, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 0%). Besides, DEX attenuates inflammatory cytokine levels, such as IL-6 (MD = -5.73; 95% CI: -8.34, -3.12; <i>p</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 91%) and TNF-α (MD = -0.63; 95% CI: -0.76, -0.50; <i>p</i> < 0.00001, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 89%). Finally, DEX increased the risk of bradycardia (OR = 1.66; 95% CI: 1.12, 2.45; <i>p</i> = 0.01, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 15%), but the complication of hypotension did not differ between the two groups (OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 0.84, 2.04; <i>p</i> = 0.25, <i>I</i> <sup><i>2</i></sup> = 0%). <b>Conclusion:</b> DEX is used for postoperative PCIA analgesia, which can significantly improve the analgesic effect, effectively control postoperative inflammatory response, reduce the dosage and adverse reactions of analgesics, and improve postoperative patient satisfaction. Of course, the impact of the immunosuppressive effect of DEX on the prognosis of patients needs further study. <b>Systematic review registration:</b> CRD42022340933, https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/.","['dexmedetomidine', 'metaanalysis', 'patient controlled intravenous analgesia', 'postoperative analgesia', 'randomized controlled trail']"
Predictive Value of Adenoid-Nasopharyngeal Ratio in the Diagnosis of Secretory Otitis Media.,"To explore the associated factors of otitis media with effusion (OME) and analyze the diagnostic value of the adenoid-nasopharyngeal (A/N) ratio to OME.Patients with adenoid hypertrophy (AH) recently in 2 years were collected, including sex, age, duration, with/without rhinosinusitis, and examination results, including Cone Beam Computerized Tomography (CBCT) sinus imaging, tympanometry, pure tone audiometry (PTA), blood test, and allergen detection. According to Liden/Jerger's classification, the patients were divided into two groups: Type B and type C, which were defined as the tympanometry abnormal group (TAG), and the rest were classified as the tympanometry normal group (TNG).A total of 316 children were included in this study. Age and duration were significantly younger and shorter in TAG (6.0(4.0-9.0) vs.5.0(4.0-7.0)); 12.0(4.0-24.0) vs.6.0(2.0-12.0)). Compared to TNG, the allergen test results of fx5 (protein, milk, cod, wheat, peanut, and soybean) in TAG were higher (0.09(0.04-0.25) vs.0.14(0.05-0.45)), but eosinophilia in blood was lower (count: 0.21(0.13-0.35) vs. 0.18(0.12-0.27); ratio: 3.10 (1.90-4.70) vs. 2.50 (1.65-3.80)). A/N ratio and Visual obstruction ratio had a statistical difference (Z = -3.770, <i>P</i> < .01) but the two ratios didn't have too much disparity (0.82(0.74-0.88) VS 0.80(0.75-0.80)), and they had a positive correlation (r = 0.345, <i>P</i> < .01). A/N ratio of TAG was higher than TNG (0.78(0.70-0.85) vs. 0.86(0.82-0.90)) and had a positive correlation with increasing negative middle ear pressure (r = -3.777, <i>P</i> < .01). A/N ratio was an associated factor of OME (OR:1355.611, <i>P</i> = .006), the cut-off value of A/N ratio was 0.815(sensitivity: 75.3%, specificity: 64.3%, area under the curve (AUC): 0.747).A/N ratio indirectly reflected the abnormality of tympanometry in this study. When A/N ratio reaches 0.815, patients are at a higher risk of having OME so it could be a predictor of OME in patients with adenoid hypertrophy.","['adenoid hypertrophy', 'adenoidnasopharyngeal ratio', 'allergic rhinosinusitis', 'otitis media with effusion']"
Evaluation of Choroidal Vascular Index in Amblyopic Patients.,"To compare subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) and choroidal vascular index (CVI) in patients with hyperopic refractive and strabismic amblyopia and healthy subjects.The study included 17 patients with strabismic amblyopia (Group 1), 29 patients with hyperopic refractive amblyopia (Group 2), and 16 eyes of 16 healthy volunteers (Group 3). Best corrected visual acuity was noted in all patients and volunteers. In addition to detailed anterior and posterior segment examinations, macular images were obtained by enhanced-depth imaging mode of optical coherence tomography (OCT). SFCT measurements were made from these images and CVI was calculated using the Image J program.No significant difference was found between the groups in terms of age, gender, and intraocular pressure (p=0.27, 0.64, and 0.85, respectively). Mean BCVAs in Group 1 were 0.57±0.16 (0.3-0.8) in the amblyopic eyes, 0.94±0.08 (0.8-1.0) in the fellow eyes, and in Group 2 were 0.61±0.17 (0.2-0.8) in amblyopic eyes, 0.92±0.1 (0.8-1.0) in fellow eyes. BCVA in Group 3 was 1.0±0 (1.0-1.0). Mean SFCT of the amblyopic eyes in Groups 1 and 2 was 341.50±60.4 (277-481) and 370.06±65.3 (247-462), respectively, and in the healthy eyes of Groups 1 and 2 and Group 3 was 321.92±68.26 (251-440), 330.35±74.00 (194-502), and 327.62±40.79 (238-385), respectively. SFCT was significantly greater in the amblyopic eyes of Group 2 compared to Group 3 (p=0.01). Mean CVI was 0.681±0.032 (0.642-0.736) in the amblyopic eyes and 0.685±0.054 (0.587-0.788) in the fellow eyes of Group 1 patients; 0.664±0.033 (0.592-0.719) in the amblyopic eye and 0.707±0.039 (0.625-0.779) in the fellow eye in Group 2 patients; and 0.689±0.031 (0.612-0.748) in Group 3 patients. CVI was significantly lower in the amblyopic eyes of Group 2 compared with fellow eyes (p=0.02) and Group 3 (p=0.025).Morphological changes may be seen in the choroid in amblyopic eyes. We observed that the choroidal stromal component is increased in hyperopic amblyopic patients especially.","['Amblyopia', 'choroidal thickness', 'choroidal vascularity index']"
Age- and sex-related regional compressive strength characteristics of human lumbar vertebrae in osteoporosis.,"To obtain the compressive load bearing and energy absorption capacity of lumbar vertebrae of osteoporotic elderly for the everyday medical praxis in terms of the simple diagnostic data, like computed tomography (CT), densitometry, age, and sex.Compressive test of 54 osteoporotic cadaver vertebrae L1 and L2, 16 males and 38 females (age range 43-93, mean age 71.6 ± 13.3 years, mean bone mineral density (BMD) 0.377 ± 0.089 g/cm(2), mean T-score -5.57 ± 0.79, Z-score -4.05 ± 0.77) was investigated. Based on the load-displacement diagrams and the measured geometrical parameters of vertebral bodies, proportional, ultimate and yield stresses and strains, Young's modulus, ductility and energy absorption capacity were determined. Three vertebral regions were distinguished: superior, central and inferior regions, but certain parameters were calculated for the upper/ lower intermediate layers, as well. Cross-sectional areas, and certain bone tissue parameters were determined by image analysis of CT pictures of vertebrae. Sex- and age-related decline functions and trends of strength characteristics were determined.Size-corrected failure load was 15%-25% smaller in women, proportional and ultimate stresses were about 30%-35% smaller for women in any region, and 20%-25% higher in central regions for both sexes. Young's moduli were about 30% smaller in women in any region, and 20%-25% smaller in the central region for both sexes. Small strains were higher in males, large strains were higher in females, namely, proportional strains were about 25% larger in men, yield and ultimate strains were quasi equal for sexes, break strains were 10% higher in women. Ultimate energy absorption capacity was 10%-20% higher in men; the final ductile energy absorption capacity was quasi equal for sexes in all levels. Age-dependence was stronger for men, mainly in central regions (ultimate load, male: r = -0.66, p < 0.01, female: r = -0.52, p < 0.005; ultimate stress, male: r = -0.69, p < 0.01, female: r = -0.50, p < 0.005; Young's modulus, male: r = -0.55, p < 0.05, female: r = -0.52, p < 0.005, ultimate stiffness, male: r = -0.58, p < 0.05, female: r = -0.35, p < 0.03, central ultimate absorbed energy density, male: r = -0.59, p < 0.015, female: r = -0.29, p < 0.08).For the strongly osteoporotic population (BMD < 0.4 g/cm(2), T-score < -4) the statical variables (loads, stresses) showed significant correlation; mixed variables (stiffness, Young's modulus, energy) showed moderate correlation; kinematical variables (displacements, strains) showed no correlation with age. The strong correlation of men between BMD and aging (r = -0.82, p < 0.001) and betwen BMD and strength parameters (r = 0.8-0.9, p < 0.001) indicated linear trends in age-related strength loss for men; however, the moderate correlation of women between BMD and aging (r = -0.47, p < 0.005) and between BMD and strength parameters (r = 0.4-0.5, p < 0.005) suggested the need of nonlinear (quadratic) approximation that provided the better fit in age-related strength functions of females modelling postmenopausal disproportionalities.","['age and sexdependence', 'energy absorption capacity', 'human lumbar vertebral body', 'load', 'osteoporosis', 'regional compressive strength', 'strain', 'stress', 'young’s modulus']"
Application of convolutional neural network-based endoscopic imaging in esophageal cancer or high-grade dysplasia: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Esophageal cancer is the seventh-most common cancer type worldwide, accounting for 5% of death from malignancy. Development of novel diagnostic techniques has facilitated screening, early detection, and improved prognosis. Convolutional neural network (CNN)-based image analysis promises great potential for diagnosing and determining the prognosis of esophageal cancer, enabling even early detection of dysplasia.To conduct a meta-analysis of the diagnostic accuracy of CNN models for the diagnosis of esophageal cancer and high-grade dysplasia (HGD).PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases were searched for articles published up to November 30, 2022. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of using the CNN model with still image-based analysis and with video-based analysis for esophageal cancer or HGD, as well as for the invasion depth of esophageal cancer. The pooled sensitivity, pooled specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) and area under the curve (AUC) were estimated, together with the 95% confidence intervals (CI). A bivariate method and hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic method were used to calculate the diagnostic test accuracy of the CNN model. Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were used to identify sources of heterogeneity.A total of 28 studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. Using still image-based analysis for the diagnosis of esophageal cancer or HGD provided a pooled sensitivity of 0.95 (95%CI: 0.92-0.97), pooled specificity of 0.92 (0.89-0.94), PLR of 11.5 (8.3-16.0), NLR of 0.06 (0.04-0.09), DOR of 205 (115-365), and AUC of 0.98 (0.96-0.99). When video-based analysis was used, a pooled sensitivity of 0.85 (0.77-0.91), pooled specificity of 0.73 (0.59-0.83), PLR of 3.1 (1.9-5.0), NLR of 0.20 (0.12-0.34), DOR of 15 (6-38) and AUC of 0.87 (0.84-0.90) were found. Prediction of invasion depth resulted in a pooled sensitivity of 0.90 (0.87-0.92), pooled specificity of 0.83 (95%CI: 0.76-0.88), PLR of 7.8 (1.9-32.0), NLR of 0.10 (0.41-0.25), DOR of 118 (11-1305), and AUC of 0.95 (0.92-0.96).CNN-based image analysis in diagnosing esophageal cancer and HGD is an excellent diagnostic method with high sensitivity and specificity that merits further investigation in large, multicenter clinical trials.","['Convolutional neural network', 'Deep learning', 'Esophageal cancer', 'Highgrade dysplasia', 'Metaanalysis', 'Systematic review']"
Therapeutic Efficacy and Safety of Percutaneous Curved Vertebroplasty in Osteoporotic Vertebral Compression Fractures: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis is aimed to provide higher quality evidence regarding the efficacy and safety between PCVP and PVP/KP in OVCFs. We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases for all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies (cohort or case-control studies) that compare PCVP to PVP/KP for OVCFs. The Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Tool and Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) were used to evaluate the quality of the RCTs and non-RCTs, respectively. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4 software. A total of seven articles consisting of 562 patients with 593 diseased vertebral bodies were included. Statistically significant differences were found in the postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) at 1 day (MD = -0.11; 95% CI: [-0.21 to -0.01], p = 0.03), but not at 3 months (MD = -0.21; 95% CI: [-0.41-0.00], p = 0.05) or 6 months (MD = 0.03; 95% CI: [-0.13-0.20], p = 0.70). There was no statistically significant difference in postoperative Oswestry disability index (ODI) at 1 day (MD = -0.28; 95% CI: [-0.62-0.05], p = 0.10), 3 months (MD = -1.52; 95% CI: [-3.11-0.07], p = 0.06), or 6 months (MD = 0.18; 95% CI: [-0.13-0.48], p = 0.25). Additionally, there were no statistically significant differences in Cobb angle (MD = 0.30; 95% CI: [-1.69-2.30], p = 0.77) or anterior vertebral body height (SMD = -0.01; 95% CI: [-0.26-0.23], p = 0.92) after surgery. Statistically significant differences were found in surgical time (MD = -8.60; 95% CI: [-13.75 to -3.45], p = 0.001), cement infusion volume (MD = -0.82; 95% CI: [-1.50 to -0.14], P = 0.02), and dose of fluoroscopy (SMD = -1.22; 95% CI: [-1.84 to -0.60], p = 0.0001) between curved and noncurved techniques, especially compared to bilateral PVP. Moreover, cement leakage showed statistically significant difference (OR = 0.40; 95% CI: [0.27-0.60], p < 0.0001). Compared with PVP/KP, PCVP is superior for pain relief at short-term follow-up. Additionally, PCVP has the advantages of significantly lower surgical time, radiation exposure, bone cement infusion volume, and cement leakage incidence compared to bilateral PVP, while no statistically significant difference is found when compared with unilateral PVP or PKP. In terms of quality of life and radiologic outcomes, the effects of PCVP and PVP/KP are not significantly different. Overall, this meta-analysis reveals that PCVP was an effective and safe therapy for patients with OVCFs.","['MetaAnalysis', 'Osteoporotic Vertebral Compression Fractures', 'Percutaneous Curved Vertebroplasty', 'Percutaneous Kyphoplasty', 'Percutaneous Vertebroplasty']"
Mediterranean Diet Combined With a Low-Carbohydrate Dietary Pattern in the Treatment of Overweight Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Patients.,"To determine the therapeutic effect of a Mediterranean diet (MED) combined with a low-carbohydrate (LC) dietary model in overweight polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients.In this 12-week randomized controlled clinical trial, 72 overweight patients with PCOS were randomly assigned to one of two energy-restricted dietary models: the MED/LC diet or the Low fat (LF) diet. After the intervention, the number of the two groups returned to normal menstruation was counted. Body weight, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, waist-hip ratio (WHR), body fat percentage (BF%), serum fasting insulin(FINS), fasting plasma glucose(FPG), insulin resistance index (HOMA-IR), quantitative insulin sensitivity index (QUIKI), total cholesterol (TC) and high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglyceride (TG), total testosterone (TT), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and prolactin (PRL) were compared between 2 groups before and after intervention.MED/LC group had more significant reduction trend in weight (-6.10 ± 1.52 kg vs -4.79 ± 0.97 kg, <i>P</i> < 0.05), BMI (-2.12 ± 0.57 kg/m<sup>2</sup> vs -1.78 ± 0.36 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, <i>P</i> < 0.05), WC (-6.12 ± 5.95 cm vs -3.90 ± 1.58 cm, <i>P</i> < 0.05), WHR (-0.06 ± 0.02 vs -0.03 ± 0.02, <i>P</i> < 0.05), BF% (-2.97% ± 1.78% vs -1.19% ± 0.91%, <i>P</i> < 0.05), TT (-0.20 ± 0.24 ng/mL vs 0.08 ± 0.11 ng/Ml, <i>P</i> < 0.001), LH (-5.28 ± 3.31 mIU/mL vs -3.39 ± 3.64 mIU/mL, <i>P</i> < 0.05), and LH/FSH (-1.18 ± 0.75 vs -0.66 ± 1.05, <i>P</i> < 0.05) compared with the LF group. In addition, FPG (0.05 ± 0.38 mmol/mL vs -0.50 ± 1.01 mmol/mL, <i>P</i> < 0.001), FINS (-4.88 ± 6.11 μU/mL vs -8.53 ± 5.61 μU/mL, <i>P</i> < 0.01), HOMA-IR index (-1.11 ± 1.51 vs -2.23 ± 0.25, <i>P</i> < 0.05), and QUIKI index (0.014 ± 0.016 vs 0.028 ± 0.019, <i>P</i> < 0.05) decreased significantly in the MED/LC group compared with the LF group. Comparing the changes in lipid parameters between the two groups (LF vs MED/LC), significant differences in TG (-0.33 ± 0.32 mmol vs -0.76 ± 0.97 mmol, <i>P</i> < 0.05), TC (-0.40 ± 1.00 mmol vs -1.45 ± 2.00 mmol, <i>P</i> < 0.05), and LDL-C (-0.41 ± 1.05 mmol vs -0.73 ± 0.76 mmol, <i>P</i> < 0.05) were observed.The results of this study suggest that the MED/LC diet model is a good treatment for overweight PCOS patients, significantly restoring their menstrual cycle, improving their anthropometric parameters and correcting their disturbed endocrine levels, and its overall effectiveness is significantly better than the LF diet model. Therefore, this study recommends that the MED/LC diet model can be used in the clinical treatment of patients with overweight PCOS.","['lowcarbohydrate diet', 'mediterranean diet', 'overweight', 'overweight mediterranean diet', 'polycystic ovary syndrome']"
Comparison of the Clinical Effectiveness of Correcting Different Types of Astigmatism with Small Incision Lenticule Extraction.,"Few studies have reported the differential outcomes of Small Incision Lenticule Extraction (SMILE) on myopic astigmatism. Given this, we examined the effectiveness of SMILE for up to one year, comparing with-the-rule (WTR), against-the-rule (ATR), and oblique astigmatism, conducting a retrospective review of patients who underwent correction of myopic astigmatism using the 500-kHz VisuMax femtosecond laser (Carl Zeiss Meditec) at two refractive clinics in Poland between 2016-2017. Patients were aged ≥21 with stable refractive errors between -0.5 and -10.0 diopter (D) with astigmatism up to 5D. The mean age of the 209 patients (355 eyes) available was 32 years; 58.4% were female. Of these, 247 had WTR, 62 oblique, and 46 ATR astigmatism. The mean pre-operative spherical equivalent (SE) was -5.4 ± 2.57D and the cylinder -1.7 ± 1.0D. The mean SE for WTR reduced from -5.60 ± 2.37D to -0.31 ± 0.67D at 2 months and -0.38 ± 0.70D at 12 months; the mean cylinder improved from -1.90 ± 1.10D to -0.31 ± 0.39D and -0.36 ± 0.43D, respectively. Eyes with oblique astigmatism also improved from a mean SE of -5.8 ± 3.4 D to -0.82 ± 1.50D and -0.69 ± 1.15D and a cylinder of -1.4 ± 0.73D to -0.17 ± 0.33D at 2 months and -0.1 ± 0.32D at 12. For ATR, the mean SE improved from -4.0 ± 1.8D to -0.08 ± 0.22D and -0.04 ± 0.12D; and the mean cylinder from -1.25 ± 0.53 to -0.02 ± 0.09D -0.08 ± 0.21D at 2 and 12 months, respectively. There were statistically significant improvements in SE, manifest sphere and cylinder refraction, and UDVA and CDVA scores for each cylinder type at 2 months with ATR cylinders having better outcomes. Although missing data limited interpretation at one year, differences were maintained. The magnitude of error calculations suggests that WTR was more prone to under-correction, particularly for high astigmatism (>1.5D). SMILE for myopic astigmatism reliably corrects SE, irrespective of the subtype of astigmatism.","['Small Incision Lenticule Extraction SMILE', 'astigmatism', 'longterm effectiveness', 'myopia', 'refractive surgery']"
Glass ionomer cements compared with composite resin in restoration of noncarious cervical lesions: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Restoring noncarious cervical lesions are challenging to clinical practice. This study aimed to compare the clinical performance/longevity of glass ionomer cements (GIC) and composite resins (CR) used for noncarious cervical lesions (NCCL) through a systematic review and meta-analysis (MA).Randomized and controlled clinical trials and nonrandomized clinical trials, which compared the clinical performance/longevity of CR and GIC (conventional and/or resin-modified) in the treatment of NCCL, were included.The methodological quality and risk of bias were evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration tool. Seven MAs were performed considering (1) the clinical performance of the parameters in common: retention, marginal discoloration, marginal adaptation, secondary caries, color, anatomic form, surface texture and (2) a follow-up time of 12, 24 and 36 months. The prevalence of successful restorations and the total number of restorations per clinical parameter/follow-up time were used to calculate the relative risk (95% CI).After screening of the studies, 13 studies were used for quantitative synthesis. The risk difference (CI 95%, α, I<sup>2</sup>) between GIC and CR for anatomic form was 0.00 (-0.02, 0.02; p = 0.83; 0%); for color was -0.02 (-0.08, 0.04; p = 0.48; 80%); for surface texture was -0.02 (-0.06, 0.02; p = 0.31; 63%); for secondary caries was -0.00 (-0.01, 0.01; p = 0.87; 0%); for marginal discoloration was 0.01 (-0.01, 0.03; p = 0.23; 3%); for marginal adaptation was 0.01 (-0.01, 0.04; p = 0.34; 32%) and for retention was 0.07 (0.02, 0.12; p = 0.003; 76%).GIC showed a clinical performance significantly higher than CR in regard to retention, whereas for the other parameters, GIC was similar to CR.NCCLs is increasingly prevalent among the population and this type of lesion causing defects in the tooth that affect not only aesthetics but also everyday habits, such as drinking, eating and teeth brushing, due to the sensitivity these lesions cause.","['Clinical research', 'Composite resin', 'Dental materials', 'Dentistry', 'Evidencebased medicine', 'Glass ionomer cements', 'Root caries']"
Alcohol-related hospitalizations of adult motorcycle riders.,"To provide an overview of the demographic characteristics of adult motorcycle riders with alcohol-related hospitalizations.Data obtained from the Trauma Registry System were retrospectively reviewed for trauma admissions at a level I trauma center between January 1, 2009 and December 31, 2013. Out of 16,548 registered patients, detailed information was retrieved regarding 1,430 (8.64%) adult motorcycle riders who underwent a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) test. A BAC level of 50 mg/dL was defined as the cut-off value for alcohol intoxication.In this study, alcohol consumption was more frequently noted among male motorcycle riders, those aged 30-49 years, those who had arrived at the hospital in the evening or during the night, and those who did not wear a helmet. Alcohol consumption was associated with a lower percentage of sustained severe injury (injury severity score ≥25) and lower frequencies of specific body injuries, including cerebral contusion (0.6; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.42-0.80), lung contusion (0.5; 95% CI = 0.24-0.90), lumbar vertebral fracture (0.1; 95% CI = 0.01-0.80), humeral fracture (0.5; 95% CI = 0.27-0.90), and radial fracture (0.6; 95% CI = 0.40-0.89). In addition, alcohol-intoxicated motorcycle riders who wore helmets had significantly lower frequencies of cranial fracture (0.4; 95% CI = 0.29-0.67), epidural hematoma (0.5; 95% CI = 0.29-0.79), subdural hematoma (0.4; 95% CI = 0.28-0.64), subarachnoid hemorrhage (0.5; 95% CI = 0.32-0.72), and cerebral contusion (0.4; 95% CI = 0.25-0.78).Motorcycle riders who consumed alcohol presented different characteristics and bodily injury patterns relative to sober patients, suggesting the importance of helmet use to decrease head injuries in alcohol-intoxicated riders.","['Blood alcohol concentration BAC', 'Helmet', 'Injury severity score ISS', 'Motorcycle', 'Trauma']"
Homocystein and carotid atherosclerosis in chronic renal failure.,"Since total homocysteine (Hcy) is markedly elevated in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), it has been presented as potential factor contributing to the high risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in CRF. The aim of the study was to examine the significance of elevated Hcy and other cardiovascular risk factors for carotid atherosclerosis in patients with CRF.Fifty six patients 16-M, 40-F, average age 58+/-14.55, creatinine clearance 39.19+/-10.11 ml/min were examined. In addition, 20 control healthy subjects were examined. The association of Hcy levels and classic risk factors for atherosclerosis with common carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was examined. B-mode ultrasound measurement of carotid IMT was performed in 56 hypertensive pts with CRF (glomerular filtration rate>20 ml/min and <90 ml/min), 44 hypertensive pts with normal renal function and 20 healthy volunteers. The mean duration of hypertension was 145.12 years.IMT in all examined hypertensive pts was increased above normal clinical value and significantly higher then in healthy controls (0.75+/-0.006/0.60+/-0.1, p<0.001). The carotid IMT was similar between hypertensive pts with CRF and hypertensive pts with normal renal function (0.74+/-0.1/0.76 +/-0.1, p>0.05). Significant predictors for IMT were age (r=0.358, p<0.04), duration of hypertension (r=0.395, p=0.023), diabetes duration (r=0.343, p<0.02), as well as duration of CRF (r=0.324, p<0.006). There was a negative correlation between IMT and glomerular filtration rate assessed by creatinine clearance (r=-0.303, p<0.003). Renal function, described by creatinine clearance was the strongest determinant for Hcy levels (r=-0.332, p<0.008). Increased IMT was estimated in pts with CRF compared to healthy controls (0.74+/-0.10 vs 0.59+/-0.10, p<0.001). We found association between Hcy and carotid IMT ( r=0.344, p<0.015). No consistent association was found between IMT and other specific for CRF cardiovascular risk factors.The study suggests that patients with mild renal failure have increased IMT of the common carotid artery and that elevated plasma Hcy level in CRF is associated with carotid intima- media thickening.","['cardiovascular risk factors', 'carotid artery', 'carotid intima media thickness', 'chronic renal failure', 'total homocystein', 'ultrasound examination']"
"Knowledge, Perceptions and Behaviors Related to COVID-19 in a University Setting in Malaysia.","In Malaysia the COVID-19 disease (COVID-19) has continued to escalate since its first detection in late January 2020, despite widespread implementation of control measures. This study aims to determine the knowledge, perception and behaviors with respect to COVID-19 in the midst of the third wave of the infection.A cross-sectional study was carried out among staffs and students of Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman (UTAR). The survey consists of basic sociodemographic information, 22 items on knowledge on COVID-19, 3 items on perceived self-risk, 2 items on preparedness & perceived self-efficacy, 10 items on preventive (own) measures, 9 items assessing unwanted and desirable behaviors during the pandemic. Simple and multiple linear regression were performed to determine the factors associated with knowledge, preventive measures adopted, self-risk perception, preparedness & perceived self-efficacy, and behaviors.A total of 434 responded to the survey of whom the majority (85.1%) had high scores for knowledge (mean score of 18.72 out of 22). A significant positive association was found between knowledge and older age (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 0.046 (0.022), <i>p</i> = 0.039), those from medical faculty (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 0.870 (0.420), <i>p</i> = 0.039) and residence in high-risk areas (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 0.831 (0.295), <i>p</i> = 0.005). Predictors for higher perception of COVID-19 risk included presence of COVID-19 cases among social contacts (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 0.751 (0.308), <i>p</i> = 0.015) and living with elderly (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 1.137 (0.296), <i>p</i> < 0.001), while that for perception of preparedness and self-efficacy were living with children (adjusted Beta coefficient (SE) = 0.440 (0.173), <i>p</i> = 0.011) and absence of positive cases among social contacts (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 0.418 (0.183), <i>p</i> = 0.023). Good preventive measures among the respondents were positively associated with knowledge (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 0.116 (0.025), <i>p</i> < 0.001), as well as with female gender (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 0.348 (0.142), <i>p</i> = 0.014). Unwanted behavior was significantly associated with male gender (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 0.664 (0.321), <i>p</i> = 0.039) and COVID-19 positive status (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 9.736 (3.297), <i>p</i> = 0.003). Knowledge of COVID-19 (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 0.069 (0.035), <i>p</i> = 0.048) and being married (adjusted B coefficient (SE) = 0.917 (0.462), <i>p</i> = 0.048) were the predictors of desirable behavior.Overall, the UTAR community had demonstrated a good level of knowledge and preventive behaviors, albeit with some areas for improvement.","['COVID19', 'behavior', 'knowledge', 'perception', 'selfefficacy', 'selfrisk']"
Flavonoid Intake From Cocoa-Based Products and Adiposity Parameters in Adolescents in Spain.,"Cocoa-based products are a good source of flavonoids, which may have beneficial effects on metabolic health.The aim of this study is to assess the relationship between flavonoids from cocoa-based products and adiposity parameters in adolescents.A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 944 adolescents aged 11-14 years enrolled in the SI! Program for Secondary Schools trial in Spain with available baseline data from food frequency questionnaires and anthropometric measurements [weight, height, waist circumference (WC), and fat mass percentage (% FM) by bioimpedance analysis]. Fat mass index (FMI) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) were obtained by dividing fat mass by height and WC by height, respectively. Body mass index (BMI), WC, and FMI for age and gender z-score were calculated. Overweight/obesity was defined as BMI ≥ 85th percentile and excess adiposity as %FM or FMI ≥ 75th percentile. WC ≥ 90th percentile and WHtR with a 0.5 threshold were considered as criteria of abdominal obesity. Multilevel mixed-effect regressions were used to evaluate the association between flavonoids from cocoa-based products and adiposity parameters. Municipalities and schools were considered random effects.Participants with a higher flavonoid intake from cocoa-based products had lower WC z-score [B = -0.04, 95% CI (-0.07; -0.01), <i>P-for trend</i> = 0.045] and WHtR [B = -0.01, 95% CI (-0.02; -0.01), <i>P- for trend</i> < 0.001]. They also had lower probability of having abdominal obesity [OR 0.66, 95% CI (0.52; 0.85), <i>P- for trend</i> = 0.001]. Inverse associations were observed between flavonoids from cocoa powder and BMI z-score [B = -0.08, 95% CI (-0.12; -0.05), <i>P</i> < 0.001], WC z-score [B = -0.06, 95% CI (-0.11; -0.02), <i>P</i> = 0.003], WHtR [B = -0.01, 95% CI (-0.01; -0.00), <i>P</i> < 0.001], %FM [B = -1.11, 95% CI (-1.48; -0.75), <i>P</i> < 0.001], and FMI z-score [B = -0.18, 95% CI (-0.20; -0.17), <i>P</i> < 0.001]. Regarding dark chocolate, an inverse association only with WC z-score [B = -0.06, 95% CI (-0.08; -0.05), <i>P</i> < 0.001] was found. However, no association was observed between flavonoids from milk chocolate intake and anthropometric parameters.A higher intake of flavonoids from cocoa-based products was associated with lower adiposity parameters and a lower probability of presenting abdominal obesity.","['polyphenols', 'cardiometabolic', 'catechin', 'epicatechin', 'obesity', 'proanthocyanidins']"
Protective effects of D-002 on experimentally induced gastroesophageal reflux in rats.,"To investigate the effects of beeswax alcohols (D-002) on the esophageal damage induced by gastroesophageal reflux (GER) in rats.Sixty male rats were randomized into six groups (10 rats/group): a negative control and five groups with experimentally induced GER: a positive vehicle control, three treated with D-002 (25, 100 and 200 mg/kg, respectively), and one with omeprazole 10 mg/kg. All treatments were given by gastric gavage. One hour after dosing, GER was produced by simultaneous ligation of the pyloric end and the forestomach. Esophageal lesions index (ELI), gastric secretion volume and acidity, and esophageal malondialdehyde (MDA) and sulfhydryl (SH) group concentrations were measured. Statistical significance was considered at P < 0.05.As compared to the negative control, the positive control group exhibited increased ELI (5.2 ± 0.33 vs 0 ± 0, P = 0.0003), gastric secretion volume (2.69 ± 0.09 vs 0.1 ± 0.0, P = 0.0003) and acidity (238 ± 19.37 vs 120.0 ± 5.77, P = 0.001), and esophageal concentrations of MDA (2.56 ± 0.1 vs 1.76 ± 0.28, P = 0.001) and SH groups (1.02 ± 0.05 vs 0.56 ± 0.08, P = 0.0003). D-002 (25, 100 and 200 mg/kg) reduced ELI (3.36 ± 0.31, 2.90 ± 0.46 and 2.8 ± 0.23, respectively) vs the positive control (5.2 ± 0.33) (P = 0.004; P = 0.002; P = 0.001, respectively). There were no significant changes in acidity with D-002 treatment, and only the highest dose reduced the volume of the gastric secretion (1.92 ± 0.25) vs the positive control (2.69 ± 0.09, P = 0.013). D-002 (25, 100 and 200 mg/kg) lowered the esophageal MDA (2.05 ± 0.16, 1.98 ± 0.22 and 1.93 ± 0.22, respectively) (P = 0.01; P = 0.03; P = 0.03, respectively) and SH group concentration (0.87 ± 0.06, 0.79 ± 0.08 and 0.77 ± 0.06, respectively) (P = 0.04; P = 0.04; P = 0.02) vs the positive control (2.56 ± 0.10 and 1.02 ± 0.05, respectively). Omeprazole decreased ELI (2.54 ± 0.47), gastric secretion volume (1.97 ± 0.14) and acidity (158.5 ± 22.79), esophageal MDA (1.87 ± 0.13) and SH group (0.72 ± 0.05) concentrations vs the positive control (P = 0.002; P = 0.001; P = 0.02; P = 0.003; P = 0.002, respectively).Acute oral administration of D-002 decreased macroscopic esophageal lesions and oxidative stress in rats with experimentally induced GER, without modifying gastric secretion acidity.","['Beeswax alcohols', 'D002', 'Esophagitis', 'Gastroesophageal reflux', 'Oxidative stress']"
Genetically predicted androgenic profiles and adverse cardiac markers: a sex-specific Mendelian randomization study.,"Observational evidence suggests associations between sex hormone levels and heart failure (HF). We used sex-specific genetic variants associated with androgenic sex hormone profiles to investigate the causal relevance of androgenic sex hormone profiles on cardiac structure and function and HF using Mendelian randomization (MR).Sex-specific uncorrelated genome-wide significant (P < 5 × 10<sup>-8</sup> ) variants predicting sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), total testosterone, and bioavailable testosterone were extracted from summary statistics of genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 425 097 participants in the UK Biobank. Sex-specific gene-outcome association estimates were computed for left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (LVEDV and LVESV, respectively), left ventricular stroke volume (LVSV), cardiac index, and cardiac output in 11 528 female and 14 356 male UK Biobank Imaging Study participants and for incident or prevalent HF in an external cohort of 47 309 cases and 930 014 controls. Inverse-variance weighted MR was the primary analysis method. In females, higher genetically predicted bioavailable testosterone was associated with lower LVEDV [β per nmol/L = -0.11 (-0.19 to -0.03), P = 0.006], lower LVESV [β = -0.09 (-0.17 to -0.01), P = 0.022], lower LVSV [β = -0.11 (-0.18 to -0.03), P = 0.005], lower cardiac output [β = -0.08 (-0.16 to 0.00), P = 0.046], and lower cardiac index [β = -0.08 (-0.16 to -0.01), P = 0.034] and a higher risk of HF [odds ratio 1.10 (1.01-1.19), P = 0.026] on external validation analysis in larger scale, sex-adjusted GWAS data. Higher genetically predicted SHBG was associated with higher LVEDV [β per nmol/L = 0.17 (0.08-0.25), P = 2 × 10<sup>-4</sup> ], higher LVESV [β = 0.13 (0.05-0.22), P = 0.003], and higher LVSV [β = 0.18 (0.08-0.28), P = 2 × 10<sup>-4</sup> ]. In males, higher genetically predicted total and bioavailable testosterone was associated with lower LVESV [β = -0.07 (-0.12 to -0.02), P = 0.007] and LVEF [β = -0.11 (-0.18 to -0.04), P = 0.003], respectively.This study supports a causal effect of pro-androgenic sex hormone profiles in females on adverse markers of left ventricular structure and function typically associated with HF with preserved ejection fraction and with HF. There was weaker evidence of association in males.","['CMR', 'Heart failure', 'Mendelian randomization', 'SHBG', 'Sex hormones', 'Testosterone']"
Higher dietary fibre intake is associated with increased skeletal muscle mass and strength in adults aged 40 years and older.,"Skeletal muscle mass begins to decline from 40 years of age. Limited data suggest that dietary fibre may modify lean body mass (BM), of which skeletal muscle is the largest and most malleable component. We investigated the relationship between dietary fibre intake, skeletal muscle mass and associated metabolic and functional parameters in adults aged 40 years and older.We analysed cross-sectional data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 2011 and 2018 from adults aged 40 years and older. Covariate-adjusted multiple linear regression analyses were used to evaluate the association between dietary fibre intake and BM components (BM, body mass index [BMI], total lean mass, appendicular lean mass, bone mineral content, total fat, trunk fat; n = 6454), glucose homeostasis (fasting glucose, fasting insulin, HOMA2-IR; n = 5032) and skeletal muscle strength (combined grip strength; n = 5326). BM components and skeletal muscle strength were expressed relative to BM (per kg of BM).Higher intakes of dietary fibre were significantly associated with increased relative total lean mass (β: 0.69 g/kg BM; 95% CI, 0.48-0.89 g/kg BM; P < 0.001), relative appendicular lean mass (β: 0.34 g/kg BM; 95% CI, 0.23-0.45 g/kg BM; P < 0.001), relative bone mineral content (β: 0.05 g/kg BM; 95% CI, 0.02-0.07 g/kg BM; P < 0.001) and relative combined grip strength (β: 0.002 kg/kg BM; 95% CI, 0.001-0.003 kg/kg BM; P < 0.001). Conversely, higher dietary fibre intakes were significantly associated with a lower BM (β: -0.20; 95% CI, -0.28 to -0.11 kg; P < 0.001), BMI (β: -0.08 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ; 95%CI, -0.10 to -0.05 kg/m<sup>2</sup> ), relative total fat (β: -0.68 g/kg BM; 95% CI, -0.89 to -0.47 g/kg BM; P < 0.001), relative trunk fat (β: -0.48 g/kg BM; 95%CI, -0.63 to -0.33 g/kg; P < 0.001), fasting glucose (β: -0.01 mmol/L; 95% CI, -0.02 to -0.00 mmol/L; P = 0.017), fasting insulin (β: -0.71 pmol/L; 95% CI, -1.01 to -0.41 pmol/L; P < 0.001) and HOMA2-IR (β: -0.02 AU; 95% CI, -0.02 to -0.01 AU; P < 0.001).Higher dietary fibre intakes are associated with a lower BM and enhanced body composition, characterized by a reduction in fat mass and an increase in lean mass. Higher dietary fibre intakes were also associated with improvements in glucose homeostasis and skeletal muscle strength. Increasing dietary fibre intake may be a viable strategy to prevent age-associated declines in skeletal muscle mass.","['Diet', 'Fibre', 'NHANES', 'Skeletal muscle']"
Effects of preharvest applications of chemicals and storage conditions on the physico-chemical characteristics and shelf life of tomato (<i>Solanum lycopersicum L.)</i> fruit.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of preharvest sprays of chemicals and evaporative cooling (ZECC) on the postharvest physico-chemical quality and shelf life of tomatoes. The experiment was conducted using a combination of ten preharvest sprays of chemicals (chitosan (0.1%), chitosan (0.3%), chitosan (0.5%), salicylic acid (SA) (0.015%), SA (0.03%), SA (0.045%), calcium chloride (CaCl<sub>2</sub>) (1%), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (3%), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (5%) and control) and two storage conditions (ambient environment storage and ZECC). The design of the experiment was completely randomized design with three replications. Data were collected from tomato samples (<i>Solanum lycopersicum L</i>. cv. ARP tomato D2) on four days interval. The result showed that all physico-chemical quality indicators were significantly (p ≤ 0.05) affected by both preharvest sprays and storage conditions. CaCl<sub>2</sub> (5%) sprays extended the shelf life of tomato by 6 days in ZECC and 11 days in ambient storage compared to the control. The highest concentration of CaCl<sub>2</sub> and SA sprays minimized PLW and maintained fruit marketability compared to the control. The firmness of tomatoes was better retained with the sprays of SA (0.045%) in both storage conditions. CaCl<sub>2</sub> (5%), SA (0.045%) and chitosan (0.5%) sprays retained the titratable acidity by 42.86%, 47.62% and 33.33%, respectively compared to the control inside ZECC storage. At the end of storage period, the highest TSS was observed on tomatoes sprayed with SA (0.03%) followed by <i>chitosan (0.1%) and chitosan (0.3%)</i>. The lycopene contents were lower with sprays of SA (0.045%), SA (0.03%), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (3%), CaCl<sub>2</sub> (5%) and chitosan (0.1%) stored inside ZECC indicating the effectiveness of preharvest sprays in delaying lycopene accumulation. Moreover, the AA contents of tomatoes sprayed with CaCl<sub>2</sub> (5%), SA (0.045%) and chitosan (0.1%) were higher by 34.10%, 38.19% and 23.84%, respectively compared to the control. The result indicated that combining preharvest chemical sprays and ZECC storage is important to maintain the physico-chemical quality and shelf life of tomatoes.","['Calcium chloride', 'Chitosan', 'Quality', 'Salicylic acid', 'Shelf life', 'Tomato fruit']"
Spatial prediction of soil erosion risk using knowledge-driven method in Malaysia's Steepland Agriculture Forested Valley.,"Soil is a fundamental resource with its value vital to the world's ecosystem. Due to the fact that soil is one of the bases of all terrestrial life, humans cannot survive without it. However, soil erosion has jeopardized soil sustainability and affected the environmental quality, leaving a bad impact if these issues were not tackled at an earlier phase. Many research has been done to predict soil erosion susceptibility areas using different methods. This research aims to classify the contributing factors of soil erosion according to the risk and generate a soil erosion risk prediction map in Cameron Highlands. Thus, this research focuses on a knowledge-driven method that uses Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) technique to achieve the objectives. This technique consists of weighing the factors adopted by comparing pairs of factors that control erosion in this area through experts' opinions. 15 factors have been chosen to build the prediction map. Result shows that rainfall erosivity is the main factor contributing to soil erosion in Cameron Highlands which is 0.110, followed by land use (0.095), slope steepness (0.089), soil texture (0.079), NDVI (0.079), TWI (0.072), slope length (0.065), slope aspect (0.064), slope altitude (0.062), SPI (0.061), lithology (0.060), slope curvature (0.054), drainage density (0.049), distance to road (0.029) and distance to stream (0.025). The west part of the study area was exposed to a high risk of soil erosion. This research will give the decision-makers, policymakers and planners insight into minimizing the soil erosion problem and suggest better precautions and solutions to overcome this severe environmental problem in the more advanced phase.","['Analytical Hierarchy Process AHP', 'Environment', 'Highland area', 'Risk prediction', 'Soil erosion']"
Association between perceived treatment adherence and health-related quality of life in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis: perspectives of both parents and children.,"The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between perceived treatment adherence and health-related quality of life (HRQOL) in children with arthritis, from both parent and child perspectives.Patients and their parents, who attended the juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) clinic at the Montreal Children's Hospital, completed the Juvenile Arthritis Quality of Life Questionnaire (JAQQ), and either the Child Adherence Report Questionnaire (CARQ) or the Parent Adherence Report Questionnaire (PARQ). Linear regression models examined the associations between perceived treatment adherence and HRQOL while adjusting for age, severity, duration of the disease, and complexity of the medical regimen.Perceived adherence to medications was associated with a better HRQOL total score from the children's perspective (beta = -0.02, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -0.03, -0.004), particularly with respect to gross motor (beta = -0.03, 95% CI = -0.05, -0.01) and psychosocial functions (beta = -0.03, 95% CI = -0.04, -0.01). According to parents, perceived adherence to exercises was associated with fewer symptoms (beta = -0.01, 95% CI = -0.03, 0.000) and better psychosocial functioning (beta = -0.01, 95% CI = -0.03, -0.002).Perceived adherence to medications is associated with an improved HRQOL according to children. According to parents, adherence to exercises may be associated with an improved HRQOL.","['healthrelated quality of life', 'juvenile idiopathic arthritis', 'treatment adherence']"
Leukocyte Telomere Length Is Related to Brain Parenchymal Fraction and Attention/Speed in the Elderly: Results of the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study.,"There are controversial results if leukocyte telomere length (LTL) is related to structural brain changes and cognitive decline in aging. Here, we investigated the association between LTL and 1) global MRI correlates of brain aging such as brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) load and Fazekas score as well as 2) global (g-factor) and domain-specific cognition such as attention/speed, conceptualization, memory, and visuopractical skills. In total, 909 participants of the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study with LTL, MRI, and cognitive tests were included. There were 388 (42.7%) men, and the mean age was 65.9 years. Longer LTL was significantly associated with larger BPF (β = 0.43, p < 0.001), larger WMH load (β = 0.03, p = 0.04), and score (β = 0.05, p = 0.04) after adjusting for age, sex, vascular risk factors, and ApoE4 carrier status. The effect on BPF was more significant in the subgroups of women (β = 0.51, p = 0.001), age >65 years (β = 0.58, p = 0.002), BMI ≥ 25 (β = 0.40, p = 0.004), education ≤10 years (β = 0.42, p = 0.002), hypertensives (β = 0.51, p = 0.001), cardiovascular disease (CVD) (β = 0.58, p = 0.005), non-diabetics (β = 0.42, p < 0.001), and Apoe4 non-carriers (β = 0.49, p < 0.001). The effect on WMH was significant within the hypertensives (load: β = 0.04, p = 0.02), non-diabetics (load:β = 0.03, p = 0.01; score: β = 0.06, p = 0.02), in those with education ≤10 years (load: β = 0.03, p = 0.04; score: β = 0.07, p = 0.02), in ApoE4 non-carriers (load: β = 0.03, p = 0.02; score: β = 0.07, p = 0.01) and in subjects without CVD (score: β = 0.06, p = 0.05). We only observed a significant association between LTL and the cognitive domain of attention/speed, which was confined to the subgroups of BMI ≥ 25 (β = 0.04, p = 0.05) and education ≤10 years (β = 0.04, p = 0.05). The effect of LTL on attention/speed was partly mediated in both subgroups by BPF (β = 0.02, 95% CI = 0.01:0.03) when tested by bootstrapping. Our results support a strong protective role of longer LTL on global brain volume which in turn may contribute to better cognitive functions, especially in the attention/speed domain in the elderly.","['attentionspeed', 'brain aging', 'brain parenchymal fraction', 'cognition', 'leukocyte telomere length', 'telomeres', 'white matter hyperintensities']"
"Maternal Experience of Domestic Violence, Associations with Children's Lipid Biomarkers at 10 Years: Findings from MINIMat Study in Rural Bangladesh.","The consequences of maternal experience of Domestic Violence (DV) on their children's cardio-metabolic risk factors are unclear. We aimed to assess if maternal exposure to any or a specific form of DV (i.e., physical, sexual, emotional and controlling behaviors) before and after childbirth was associated with their children's lipid biomarkers at the age of 10 years. A current observational sub-study of a larger MINIMat trial included a cohort of 1167 mothers and their children. The conflict tactic scale was used to record women's experience of lifetime DV before and after childbirth at week 30 of pregnancy and at a 10-year follow up, respectively. Five ml of fasting blood sample was collected from the children to evaluate their lipid profile. Children of women who experienced any DV before childbirth had lower Apo A (β<sub>adj</sub> -0.04; 95% CI: -0.08, -0.01). Women who experienced physical DV both before and after childbirth had children with higher triglycerides (β<sub>adj</sub> 0.07; 95% CI: 0.01, 0.14). Children whose mother experienced sexual DV before birth had lower Apo A (β<sub>adj</sub> -0.05; 95% CI: -0.08, -0.01) and High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) (β<sub>adj</sub> -0.05; 95% CI: -0.10, -0.01) as well as higher Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) (β<sub>adj</sub> 0.17; 95% CI: 0.05, 0.29) and LDL/HDL (β 0.24; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.38). However, levels of LDL (β<sub>adj</sub> -0.17; 95% CI: -0.28, -0.06), LDL/HDL (β<sub>adj</sub> -0.12; 95% CI: -0.25, -0.00) and cholesterol (β<sub>adj</sub> -0.13; 95% CI: -0.25, -0.02) were lower among the children of mothers who experienced controlling behavior after childbirth. Results from the current study suggest that maternal experience of physical or sexual DV might negatively affect their children's lipid profile at the age of 10 years.","['Bangladesh', 'children', 'domestic violence', 'lipid biomarkers']"
Comparing the effect of a multisectoral agricultural intervention on HIV-related health outcomes between widowed and married women.,"Widowed women make up 18-40% of the 12 million women living with HIV in eastern and southern Africa. Widowhood has also been associated with greater HIV morbidity and mortality. We compared the effectiveness of a multisectoral climate adaptive agricultural livelihood intervention (called Shamba Maisha) on food insecurity, and HIV related health outcomes among widowed and married women living with HIV in western Kenya.We implemented Shamba Maisha (NCT02815579) using a cluster-randomized control trial design. The intervention arm received an US$175 in-kind loan to purchase a micro-irrigation pump, seeds, and fertilizer, and received eight training sessions on sustainable agriculture and financial management. Study outcomes were measured every 6 months over a 24-month follow-up period and trends in outcomes assessed using multilevel mixed-effects models.The trial enrolled 232 (61.5%) married and 145 (38.5%) widowed women. Widowed women (mean age 42.8 ± 8.4 years) were older than married women (35.8 ± 9.0 years) (p < 0.01). Almost all widowed women (97.2%) self-identified as household heads compared to 10.8% of married women. Comparing widowed vs married women, reduction in food insecurity (-3.13, 95%CI -4.42, -1.84 vs. -3.08, 95%CI -4.15, -2.02), depressive symptoms (-0.21, 95%CI -0.36, -0.07 vs. -0.19, 95%CI -0.29, -0.08), internalized stigma (-0.33, 95%CI -0.55, -0.11 vs. -0.38, 95%CI -0.57, -0.19), and anticipated stigma (-0.46 95%CI -0.65, -0.28 vs. -0.35, 95%CI -0.50, -0.21) was similar for both groups. In contrast, improvements in social support (-2.22, 95%CI -3.85, -0.59 vs. -4.00, 95%CI -5.16, -2.84; p = 0.08) and reduction in enacted stigma (0.01, 95%CI -0.06, 0.08 vs. -0.14, 95%CI -0.20, -0.09; p < 0.01) were weaker for widowed than married women.Our study is among the first comparing the effect of a livelihood intervention on HIV health outcomes among widowed and married women. Widowed women experienced similar benefits as married women on individual-level outcomes, but weaker benefit on outcomes dependent on their external environment like enacted stigma and social support. Future trials and programs targeting widowed women should bolster stigma reduction and social support.","['Africa', 'Depression', 'Food insecurity', 'HIVAIDS', 'Marital status', 'Social support', 'Stigma', 'Widowhood']"
Mediating role of oxidative/nitrosative stress biomarkers in the associations between phthalate exposure and thyroid function in Taiwanese adults.,"Phthalate exposure was shown to alter thyroid function, however it is unclear, whether oxidative and nitrosative stress explains the intermediate biological mechanism. This study aimed to investigate the associations between phthalate exposure, oxidative/nitrosative stress, and thyroid function in adults, and to examine the mediating role of oxidative/nitrosative stress in the associations between phthalate exposure and thyroid function. Levels of eleven urinary phthalate metabolites, three urinary biomarkers of oxidative/nitrosative stress (malondialdehyde [MDA], 8-OHdG, and 8-NO<sub>2</sub>Gua) and five serum thyroid hormones (thyroxine [T<sub>4</sub>], free T<sub>4</sub>, triiodothyronine, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and thyroxine-binding globulin) were measured in 266 Taiwanese adults. Cross-sectional associations between phthalate metabolites, biomarkers of oxidative/ nitrosative stress and thyroid hormones were analyzed using multivariate regression models. Mediation analysis was conducted to assess the role of oxidative/nitrosative stress in the associations between phthalate metabolites and thyroid hormone levels. Sum of di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) metabolites was positively associated with MDA (β<sub>T1-T2</sub> = 0.253, 95%CI [0.060, 0.447]; β <sub>≧ T2</sub> = 0.317, 95% CI [0.098, 0.536]; P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.005) and 8-NO<sub>2</sub>Gua (β<sub>T1-T2</sub> = -0.010, 95%CI [-0.138, 0.118]; β <sub>≧ T2</sub> = 0.144, 95% CI [-0.001, 0.289]; P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.045). Mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) was positively associated with 8-NO<sub>2</sub>Gua (β<sub>T1-T2</sub> = 0.201, 95% CI [0.078, -0.324]; β <sub>≧ T2</sub> = 0.161, 95% CI [0.031, -0.292]; P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.018). T<sub>4</sub> was negatively associated with MDA (β<sub>T1-T2</sub> =  -0.027, 95% CI [-0.088, 0.0034]; β<sub>≧T2</sub> = -0.094, 95% CI [-0.161, -0.028]; P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.005) and 8-NO<sub>2</sub>Gua (β<sub>T1-T2</sub> = -0.068, 95% CI [-0.127, -0.010]; β<sub>≧T2</sub> = -0.125, 95% CI [-0.184, -0.066]; P<sub>trend</sub> < 0.001). Free T<sub>4</sub> was positively associated with MDA (P<sub>trend</sub> = 0.047) and with 8-NO<sub>2</sub>Gua (P<sub>trend</sub> < 0.001). 8-NO<sub>2</sub>Gua mediated 11% of the association between the sum of DEHP metabolites and T<sub>4</sub>, and 17% of the association between MnBP and free T<sub>4</sub>. These results suggest that phthalate exposure may influence thyroid hormone levels through induced oxidative/nitrosative stress.","['Mediation analysis', 'Nitrosative stress', 'Oxidative stress', 'Phthalates', 'Thyroid hormones']"
Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of <i>SERPINE1</i> 4G/5G Insertion/Deletion Variant With Circulating Lipid Levels.,"Recent studies have shown that the 4G/5G insertion/deletion variant of <i>SERPINE1</i> (rs1799889) is closely linked to coronary artery disease (CAD). This study aims to clarify the effects of the rs1799889 variant on lipid levels and to insight into the mechanisms underlying the rs1799889 variant and CAD.By searching PubMed and the Cochrane databases for studies published before 31 October 2021, 40 studies conducted on a total of 13,117 subjects were included for the analysis. The consistent findings for the effects of the 5G allele of rs1799889 variant on lipid metabolism were the significantly decreased triglycerides (TG) [standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.12, 95% CI = -0.21 to 0.03, <i>P</i> = 0.01], total cholesterol (TC) (SMD = -0.12, 95% CI = -0.17 to 0.06, <i>P</i> < 0.001), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (SMD = -0.13, 95% CI = -0.23 to 0.03, <i>P</i> = 0.01) levels. Intriguingly, the significant effects of the rs1799889 variant on LDL-C (SMD = -0.15, 95% CI = -0.26 to 0.05, <i>P</i> < 0.01) and TC (SMD = -0.17, 95% CI = -0.27 to 0.07, <i>P</i> < 0.01) levels were primarily observed in the Asian population. However, the significant effect of the rs1799889 variant on high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (SMD = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.03-0.48, <i>P</i> = 0.03) levels was detected only in female subjects.The rs1799889 variant of <i>SERPINE1</i> is a protective genetic factor against CAD, the Asian population with the 5G allele of the rs1799889 variant may have a reduced CAD risk.","['Asian', 'coronary artery disease', 'lipid', 'polymorphism', 'rs1799889']"
"Milk production status and associated factors among indigenous dairy cows in Raya Kobo district, north eastern Ethiopia.","A cross-sectional survey study was conducted from September 2020 to April 2021. A total of 217 households were randomly selected. The data collection instruments were structured questionnaires: focus group discussion and key informant interviews. Data were coded, entered and analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 20 software. Ranking indexes as well as binary logistic regression analysis were used to look for the relationship between dependent and independent variables.The present study showed that season of calving, disease and parasite challenges, housing conditions and shortage of land for forage production with an index value of 0.180, 0.154, 0.153 and 0.126, respectively, were the most important constraints affecting milk production potential. Likewise, foot and mouth disease [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.001, 95% confidence interval (CI) = (0.000-0.016)], internal parasites [AOR = 0.003, 95% CI = (0.000-0.046)], shortage of grazing land [AOR = 0.017, 95% CI = (0.002-0.148)], summer season of calving [AOR = 0.012, 95% CI = (0.002-0.088)], overall cattle herd composition [AOR = 0.002, 95% CI = (0.000-0.025)], straw shed [AOR = 0.046, 95% CI = (0.006-0.327)] and open yard [AOR = 0.003, 95% CI = (0.000-0.183)] housing conditions were significantly associated with milk production status at p < 0.001 and p < 0.05.The current study indicated that milk production status was poor. Therefore, suitable government policy support and provision of subsidies, genuine participation of dairy producers with governmental and non-governmental organizations are imperative to improve livestock productivity. Furthermore, future research and development actions should find solutions to decrease the bottlenecks so that the massive potentials of the area could be exploited to its maximum and could advance the livelihood of the community.","['Ethiopia', 'Raya Kobo', 'indigenous dairy cows', 'milk production status']"
Genetic Parameters for Different Measures of Feed Efficiency and Their Relationship to Production Traits in Three Purebred Pigs.,"Residual feed intake (RFI) gained attention as a potential alternative to the feed conversion ratio (FCR). Thus, this study aimed to estimate genetic parameters for different feed efficiency (FE) traits (FCR, RFI1 to RFI5) and their genetic correlation to on-test daily weight gain (ADG), backfat (BFT), loin muscle area (LMA), lean percentage (LP), and total feed intake (FI) for 603 Male Duroc (DD), 295 Landrace (LL), and 341 Yorkshire (YY). The common spatial pen effect was also estimated in these traits. Five RFI measures were estimated by regressing daily feed intake on initial testing age (ITA), initial testing weight (IBW), and ADG for RFI1; other models were the same as RFI1 except for additional BFT for RFI2; LMA for RFI3; BFT and LMA for RFI4; BFT, LMA, and average metabolic body weight (AMBW) instead of IBW for RFI5. Genetic parameters estimated using two animal models and the REML method showed moderate heritability for FCR in all breeds (0.22 and 0.28 for DD, 0.31 and 0.39 for LL, 0.17 and 0.22 for YY), low heritability for the majority of RFI measures in DD (0.15 to 0.23) and YY (0.14 to 0.20) and moderate heritability for all RFI measures in LL (0.31 to 0.34). Pen variance explained 7% to 22% for FE and 0% to 9% for production traits' phenotypic variance. The genetic correlation revealed that selection against less complex RFI1 in DD and LL and RFI2 in YY would bring the most advantageous reduction to FI (0.71 for DD, 0.49 for LL, 0.43 YY) without affecting ADG in all breeds (0.06 for DD, -0.11 for LL, 0.05 for YY), decrease in BFT, and increase in LP in DD (0.51 in BFT, -0.77 in LP) and LL (0.45 in BFT, -0.83 in LP). Therefore, inclusion of these breed-specific RFI measures in the future selection criteria would help improve feed efficiency in the swine industry.","['feed efficiency', 'genetic parameters', 'residual feed intake']"
Adipose tissue depot and cell size dependency of adiponectin synthesis and secretion in human obesity.,"Adiponectin is an insulin sensitizing fat cell (FC) hormone whose levels are related to adipose tissue (AT) mass and depot distribution. We hypothesized that the nature of AT expansion (hypertrophy vs. hyperplasia) contributes to obesity-related reductions in serum adiponectin and that this effect is influenced by the regional distribution of AT to subcutaneous (S) and visceral (V) depots. Thirteen obese subjects provided paired AT biopsies. Serum total and high molecular weight (HMW) adiponectin levels were determined by ELISA. Secretion was quantified following 24-h explant culture. FC size, number, % large, and % small FC were determined by microscopic analysis. Secretion of total adiponectin was highest by SAT (P = 0.008) and correlated more strongly with serum adiponectin (total: P = 0.015, r = 0.77; HMW: P = 0.005, r = 0.83) than did secretion by VAT (P = 0.05, r = 0.66 for both). FC size was greatest in SAT and correlated negatively with both serum (total: P = 0.01, r = -0.74; HMW: P = 0.03, r = -0.69) and secreted (total: P = 0.05, r = -0.72; HMW: P = 0.02, r = -0.87) adiponectin. The % small FC in SAT correlated positively with both serum (total: P = 0.006, r = 0.87; HMW: P = 0.009, r = 0.79) and secreted (total: P = 0.03, r = 0.75; HMW: P = 0.01, r = 0.92) adiponectin. VAT FC size correlated negatively with serum HMW adiponectin (P = 0.01, r = -0.76) but not with any measure of secretion. VAT had the greatest % small FC, which related positively to serum HMW (P = 0.004, r = 0.81) and to secreted total adiponectin (P = 0.02, r = 0.78). These studies indicate that differences in fat cell size and depot distribution of AT expansion are important influences on adiponectin in obesity.","['adipocyte', 'adiponectin', 'adipose tissue depots', 'fat cell size', 'high molecular weight', 'insulin resistance', 'subcutaneous adipose tissue', 'visceral adipose tissue']"
Effectiveness of red yeast rice on carotid atherosclerosis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"While several studies have demonstrated the preventive and therapeutic effects of red yeast rice (RYR), a traditional Chinese medicine, on carotid atherosclerosis through the reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level and other risk factors, the evidence remains inconsistent. This study aimed to further evaluate the effects of RYR in carotid atherosclerosis. Several databases were searched for original trials of RYR for the treatment of carotid atherosclerosis that reported plaque indicators. Carotid plaque area (AREA), carotid plaque score (SCORE), and intima-media thickness (IMT) were set as the primary outcomes, while lipid profile and safety indicators were set as the secondary outcomes. Meta-analyses were performed on the randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using Comprehensive Meta-analysis software. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> index and <i>Q</i> statistic. Subgroup, sensitivity, and dose-effect analyses were conducted. Twenty RCTs with 2217 patients were included. Compared to the control group, AREA (<i>SMD</i> = -0.855, <i>95%CI</i>: -1.259 to -0.451, <i>p</i> < 0.001), IMT (<i>SMD</i> = -0.588, <i>95%CI</i>: -0.792 to -0.384, <i>p</i> < 0.001), SCORE (<i>SMD</i> = -0.708, <i>95%CI</i>: -1.135 to -0.282, <i>p</i> = 0.001), LDL-C (<i>SMD</i> = -0.938, <i>95%CI</i>: -1.375 to -0.502, <i>p</i> < 0.001), triglyceride (<i>SMD</i> = -0.766, <i>95%CI</i>: -0.980 to -0.551, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and total cholesterol (<i>SMD</i> = -0.858, <i>95%CI</i>: -1.254 to -0.462, <i>p</i> < 0.001) were significantly decreased and HDL-C (<i>SMD</i> = 0.389, <i>95%CI</i>: 0.044-0.733, <i>p</i> = 0.027) was significantly increased following RYR therapy. The indicators for safety were not significant and did not differ between the two groups (<i>p</i> > 0.050). Heterogeneities mainly existed for the treatment time or control group setting. Most results showed no changes in the sensitivity analysis. Dose-effect relationships were observed for all indicators except for TC and HDL-C. We concluded that RYR therapy showed considerable efficacy and an acceptable safety profile for the treatment of carotid atherosclerosis in the Chinese population.","['carotid atherosclerosis', 'efficacy', 'metaanalysis', 'red yeast rice RYR', 'systematic review']"
Influence of Repeated-Sprint Ability on the in-Game Activity Profiles of Semiprofessional Rugby Union Players According to Position.,"This study investigated the influence of repeated-sprint ability (RSA) on the activity of rugby union players in a competitive situation according to their position. Thirty-three semiprofessional rugby union players (age, 25.6 ± 4.3; height, 184.0 ± 8.0 cm; weight, 98.9 ± 13.9 kg, ~20 h training a week), divided into two position subgroups (forwards <i>n</i> = 20, backs <i>n</i> = 13) or four positional subgroups (front row and locks <i>n</i> = 13, back row <i>n</i> = 7, inside backs <i>n</i> = 6, outside backs <i>n</i> = 7), were tested. Their RSA was assessed with a 12 × 20 m sprint test over a 20 s cycle. GPS data (distance, acceleration, number of sprints, maximum velocity, and high-velocity running) and technical data were collected on 18 semiprofessional division rugby union games. In forwards, players with lower cumulated sprint time in the RSA test produced significantly more accelerations (<i>ρ</i> = -0.85, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and more combat actions per match minute (<i>ρ</i> = -0.69, <i>p</i> < 0.001). In backs, RSA was significantly correlated with high-intensity running [distance (<i>ρ</i> = -0.76), V<sub>max</sub> (<i>ρ</i> = -0.84), sprints frequency (<i>ρ</i> = -0.71), high-velocity running (<i>ρ</i> = -0.76), all <i>p</i> < 0.01]. Then, the players were divided into four subgroups (front row and locks, back row, inside backs and outside backs). RSA was significantly associated with the number of accelerations (<i>ρ</i> = -0.96, <i>p</i> <001) and combat actions in front row and locks (<i>ρ</i> = -0.71, <i>p</i> = 0.007). In the back row, RSA was correlated with distance (<i>ρ</i> = -0.96, <i>p</i> = 0.003) and the frequency of combat actions (<i>ρ</i> = -0.79, <i>p</i> = 0.04). In inside backs, RSA was significantly (all <i>p</i> < 0.01) correlated with distance (<i>ρ</i> = -0.81), number of accelerations (<i>ρ</i> = -0.94) and high-velocity running (<i>ρ</i> = -0.94), while in outside backs, RSA was associated with sprint frequency (<i>ρ</i> = -0.85) and the maximal in-game velocity reached (<i>ρ</i> = -0.89). These results demonstrate that RSA is associated with match running and combat activity performance (i) regardless of the position on the pitch and (ii) specifically for each player's position by improving the corresponding activity profile.","['RSA', 'high intensity', 'key performance indicators', 'movement characteristics', 'rugby']"
Vascular comorbidity is associated with lower brain volumes and lower neuroperformance in a large multiple sclerosis cohort.,"The objective of this study is to assess the association between vascular comorbidity burden with clinical and imaging features of disease burden in a large population of people with multiple sclerosis (MS).We included participants from the MS Partners Advancing Technology Health Solutions (MS PATHS) cohort. We evaluated if vascular comorbidities (diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia) or a composite sum of comorbidities was associated with MS characteristics, including objective neurologic function assessments and quantitative brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements in propensity score-weighted models.In total, 11,506 participants (6409 (55%) with brain MRI) were included. Individuals with 2+ vascular comorbidities had slower walking speed (standard deviation (SD) = -0.49; 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.78, -0.19; <i>p</i> = 0.001), slower manual dexterity (SD = -0.41; 95% CI = -0.57, -0.26; <i>p</i> < 0.0001), and fewer correct scores on cognitive processing speed (SD = -0.11; 95% CI = -0.20, -0.02; <i>p</i> = 0.02) versus those with no comorbidities. Those with 2+ had lower brain parenchymal (-0.41%, 95% CI = -0.64, -0.17) and gray matter fractions (-0.30%, 95% CI = -0.49, -0.10), including reduced cortical (-10.10 mL, 95% CI = -15.42, -4.78) and deep (-0.44 mL, 95% CI = -0.84, -0.04) gray matter volumes versus those with no comorbidity.Increased vascular comorbidity burden was associated with clinical and imaging markers of neurologic dysfunction and neurodegeneration in MS. Strategies to optimize comorbidity management in people with MS are warranted.","['Comorbidity', 'epidemiology', 'metabolic disorders']"
Intensity of Leisure-Time Exercise and Risk of Depressive Symptoms Among Japanese Workers: A Cohort Study.,"Data on the effect of physical activity intensity on depression is scarce. We investigated the prospective association between intensity of leisure-time exercise and risk of depressive symptoms among Japanese workers.The participants were 29,052 employees (24,653 men and 4,399 women) aged 20 to 64 years without psychiatric disease including depressive symptoms at health checkup in 2006-2007 and were followed up until 2014-2015. Details of leisure-time exercise were ascertained via a questionnaire. Depressive states were assessed using a 13-item questionnaire. Multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of depressive symptoms was estimated using Cox regression analysis.During a mean follow-up of 5.8 years with 168,203 person-years, 6,847 workers developed depressive symptoms. Compared with workers who engaged in no exercise during leisure-time (0 MET-hours per week), hazard ratios (95% confidence intervals) associated with >0 to <7.5, 7.5 to <15.0, and ≥15.0 MET-hours of leisure-time exercise were 0.88 (0.82-0.94), 0.85 (0.76-0.94), and 0.78 (0.68-0.88) among workers who engaged in moderate-intensity exercise alone; 0.93 (0.82-1.06), 0.82 (0.68-0.98), and 0.83 (0.71-0.98) among workers who engaged in vigorous-intensity exercise alone; and 0.96 (0.80-1.15), 0.80 (0.67-0.95), and 0.76 (0.66-0.87) among workers who engaged in both moderate- and vigorous-intensity exercise with adjustment for age, sex, lifestyles, work-related and socioeconomic factors, and body mass index. Additional adjustment for baseline depression score attenuated the inverse association, especially among those who engaged in moderate-intensity exercise alone.The results suggest that vigorous-intensity exercise alone or vigorous-intensity combined with moderate-intensity exercise would prevent depressive symptoms among Japanese workers.","['cohort studies', 'depressive symptoms', 'intensity', 'physical activity', 'prevention']"
Decreased lipid levels in adult with congenital heart disease: a systematic review and Meta-analysis.,"Metabolic disorders were a health problem for many adults with congenital heart disease, however, the differences in metabolic syndrome-related metabolite levels in adults with congenital heart disease compared to the healthy population were unknown.We collected 18 studies reporting metabolic syndrome-associated metabolite levels in patients with congenital heart disease. Data from different studies were combined under a random-effects model using Cohen's d values.The results found that the levels of total cholesterol (Cohen's d -0.68, 95% CI: -0.91 to -0.45), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Cohen's d -0.63, 95% CI: -0.89 to -0.37), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (Cohen's d -0.32, 95% CI: -0.54 to -0.10) were significantly lower in congenital heart disease patients compared with controls. Congenital heart disease patients also had a lower body mass index (Cohen's d -0.27, 95% CI: -0.42 to -0.12) compared with controls. On the contrary, congenital heart disease patients had higher levels of hemoglobin A1c (Cohen's d 0.93, 95% CI: 0.17 to 1.70) than controls. Meanwhile, there were no significant differences in triglyceride (Cohen's d 0.07, 95% CI: -0.09 to 0.23), blood glucose (Cohen's d -0.12, 95% CI: -0.94 to 0.70) levels, systolic (Cohen's d 0.07, 95% CI: -0.30 to 0.45) and diastolic blood pressure (Cohen's d -0.10, 95% CI: -0.39 to 0.19) between congenital heart disease patients and controls.The lipid levels in patients with congenital heart disease were significantly lower than those in the control group. These data will help in the health management of patients with congenital heart disease and guide clinicians.CRD42022228156.","['Adult congenital heart disease', 'Dyslipidemia', 'HDLC', 'LDLC', 'TC']"
Seroprevalence of brucellosis in sheep and goats in the Arabian Gulf region.,"Brucellosis is a zoonosis that occurs worldwide. There were more efforts to control brucellosis in all countries. This study was performed to determine the seroprevalence of brucellosis in sheep and goats in some areas in the Arabian Gulf.The study analyzed 8500 sera from non-vaccinated sheep and goats. Animals included 6441 sheep (3420 from farms and 3021 from quarantine) and 2059 goats (1580 from farms and 479 from quarantine). Sera were tested using the Rose Bengal Plate Test (RBPT) and confirmed with an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (i-ELISA) test. Final confirmation analyzed blood samples from confirmed infected animals (n=30, 23 sheep and seven goats) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and culture.The serological examination showed that 62/8500 of animals (0.729%, confidence interval [CI] 95% 0.57-0.94) were seropositive for brucellosis. Thirteen of 5000 (0.26%, CI 95% 0.15-0.45) and 49/3500 (1.4%, CI 95% 1.1-1.8) of animals from farms and quarantine were seropositive, respectively. Out of the 6441, 46 (0.71%) sheep and 16/2059 (0.78%) goats were seropositive. i-ELISA confirmed 41/62 RBPT-positive animals - 41/8500 (0.482%, CI 95% 0.36-0.65). Eight of 5000 of these animals (0.16%, CI 95% 0.08-0.32) and 33/3500 (0.94%, CI 95% 0.67-1.3) were confirmed positive in farms and quarantine, respectively. Thirty of 6441 (0.466%) and 11/2059 (0.534%) cases were positive in sheep and goats, respectively. PCR confirmed 18 of 41 positive animals (0.212% of all sera, CI 95% 0.13-0.34) identified by both RBPT and i-ELISA. Three of 5000 (0.06%, CI 95% 0.019-0.19) and 15/3500 (0.429%, CI 95% 0.26-0.71) from farms and quarantine were confirmed positive. Tissue samples (uterine, supra-mammary, testicular, and accessory glands lymph node) were collected from positive animals, as detected by RBPT and i-ELISA, at culling or slaughtering. Using <i>in vitro</i> culture, 14/30 were confirmed positive - 3/7 from farms (two sheep and one goat) and 11/23 from quarantine (nine sheep and two goats). Biovar 1 was dominant. PCR confirmed 23/30 tissue samples, 4/7 from farms (three sheep and one goat), and 19/23 from quarantine (15 sheep and four goats).The overall brucellosis rate in sheep and goats is 0.48%, with fewer animals from farms testing positive (0.16%) in this area of the Arabian Gulf. The infection appears to be well controlled, and continuous effort is still needed to maintain control and completely eradicate brucellosis. Additional support is needed for testing and slaughterhouse monitoring. In quarantine (imported animals), brucellosis infection in the slaughterhouse (0.94%) could pose a risk for transmission and spread of infection. The effort is needed to monitor this threat, and PCR is a sensitive and time-saving test for brucellosis diagnosis. All 14 confirmed positive samples were Biovar 1 dominant.","['Arabian gulf', 'Brucellosis', 'Rose Bengal', 'goats', 'indirect enzymelinked immunosorbent assay', 'polymerase chain reaction', 'seroprevalence', 'sheep']"
Fluid Metabolism in Athletes Running Seven Marathons in Seven Consecutive Days.,"<b>Purpose:</b> Hypohydration and hyperhydration are significant disorders of fluid metabolism in endurance performance; however, little relevant data exist regarding multi-stage endurance activities. The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of running seven marathons in 7 consecutive days on selected anthropometric, hematological and biochemical characteristics with an emphasis on hydration status. <b>Methods:</b> Participants included 6 women and 20 men (age 42.6 ± 6.2 years). Data was collected before day 1 (B<sub>1</sub>) and after day 1 (A<sub>1</sub>), 4 (A<sub>4</sub>), and 7 (A<sub>7</sub>). <b>Results:</b> The average marathon race time was 4:44 h:min (ranging from 3:09 - 6:19 h:min). Plasma sodium, plasma potassium and urine sodium were maintained during the race. Body mass (<i>p</i> < 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.501), body fat (<i>p</i> < 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.572) and hematocrit (<i>p</i> < 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.358) decreased. Plasma osmolality (Posm) (<i>p</i> < 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.416), urine osmolality (Uosm) (<i>p</i> < 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.465), urine potassium (<i>p</i> < 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.507), urine specific gravity (Usg) (<i>p</i> < 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.540), plasma urea (PUN) (<i>p</i> < 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.586), urine urea (UUN) (<i>p</i> < 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.532) and transtubular potassium gradient (<i>p</i> < 0.001, η<sup>2</sup> = 0.560) increased at A<sub>1</sub>, A<sub>4</sub>, and A<sub>7</sub> vs. B<sub>1</sub>. Posm correlated with PUN at A<sub>1</sub> (<i>r</i> = 0.59, <i>p</i> = 0.001) and A<sub>4</sub> (<i>r</i> = 0.58, <i>p</i> = 0.002). The reported post-race fluid intake was 0.5 ± 0.2 L/h and it correlated negatively with plasma [Na<sup>+</sup>] (<i>r</i> = -0.42, <i>p</i> = 0.007) at A<sub>4</sub> and (<i>r</i> = -0.50, <i>p</i> = 0.009) at A<sub>7</sub>. Uosm was associated with UUN at A<sub>1</sub> (<i>r</i> = 0.80, <i>p</i> < 0.001), at A<sub>4</sub> (<i>r</i> = 0.81, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and at A<sub>7</sub> (<i>r</i> = 0.86, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and with Usg (<i>r</i> = 0.71, <i>p</i> < 0.001) at A<sub>1</sub>, (<i>r</i> = 0.52, <i>p</i> = 0.006) at A<sub>4</sub> and (<i>r</i> = 0.46, <i>p</i> = 0.02) at A<sub>7</sub>. <b>Conclusions:</b> Despite the decrease in body mass, fluid and electrolyte balance was maintained with no decrease in plasma volume after running seven marathons in seven consecutive days. Current findings support the hypothesis that body mass changes do not reflect changes in the hydration status during prolonged exercise.","['endurance', 'hydration status', 'multistage marathon', 'running', 'sodium']"
Patient Assessment of Care with Chronic Cardiovascular Disorders and Its Relationship with Self-Efficacy: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Patients' assessment of care navigating cardiovascular disorders is imperative in improving the quality of care provided. The purpose of this study was to explore the perspectives of people living with cardiovascular disorders on the care they received and its relationship with general self-efficacy.This investigation employed a cross-sectional correlational approach. The study sample was comprised of patients with cardiovascular disorders from both the King Khalid Hospital and the King Salman Specialist Hospital, in Hail City, Saudi Arabia. Convenience sampling was used, resulting in 104 participants. A survey using a self-administered questionnaire was employed to collect the data, which ran from 10 March to 20 May 2023.The participants perceived that they occasionally (2.75 ± 1.053) received care, and they perceived themselves to have better self-efficacy (25.28/40). Of note, the age (0.062), years of being diagnosed with having the disease (-0.174), sex (0.180), educational attainment (0.125), and occupation (0.206) were found to have no significant relationship with the patient assessment of care with chronic cardiovascular disease (PACIC). However, civil status (0.867) was found to have a strong positive correlation to the PACIC. No significant relationship was found between age and GSE (0.070) and PACIC (0.62), civil status with GSE (0.013), years being diagnosed with having the disease with GSE (0.095), and PACIC (0.174) educational attainment with GSE (0.088) and PACIC (0.125) or occupation (0.115) with GSE. However, sex (0.795) was found to have a strong correlation with general self-efficacy (GSE). Of note, patient activation (0.390) and goal setting (0.360) had a moderate positive correlation while problem solving (0.228) and follow-up (0.278) had a weak positive correlation to GSE. Meanwhile, the delivery system (0.507) had a strong positive correlation to GSE. This study illuminates the value of self-efficacy and patient involvement as self-management techniques for cardiovascular illnesses. Future cardiovascular illness self-management initiatives should concentrate on enhancing patient self-efficacy by adopting the PACIC.","['assessment of care', 'chronic cardiovascular disease', 'correlational', 'patient', 'selfefficacy']"
Association of Electrocardiographic Signs of Right Ventricular Hypertrophy and Clot Localization in Chronic Thromboembolic Pulmonary Hypertension.,"The role of electrocardiography (ECG) in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) diagnosis and prognosticating has not been yet established. We aimed to assess the relationships of the recommended ECG criteria of right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) with clot localization in CTEPH patients. ECG patterns of RVH according to the American College of Cardiology Foundation were assessed in patients with newly diagnosed CTEPH. We enrolled 58 (45.3%) patients with proximal and 70 (54.7%) with distal CTEPH. Receiver-operating characteristics curves analysis indicated that the following ECG abnormalities predicted proximal CTEPH localization: R<sub>V1</sub> > 6 mm-AUC 0.75 (CI: 0.66-0.84, <i>p</i> < 0.00001); S<sub>V6</sub> > 3 mm-AUC 0.70 (CI: 0.60-0.79, <i>p</i> < 0.00001); S<sub>I</sub> > R<sub>I</sub> wave-AUC 0.67 (CI: 0.58-0.77, <i>p</i> = 0.0004); R<sub>V1</sub>:S<sub>V1</sub> > 1.0-AUC 0.66 (CI: 0.56-0.76, <i>p</i> = 0.0009); R<sub>V1</sub> peak > 0.035 s (QRS < 120 ms)-AUC 0.66 (CI: 0.56-0.75, <i>p</i> = 0.0016); R<sub>V1</sub>:S<sub>V1</sub> > R<sub>V3(V4)</sub>:S<sub>V3(V4)-</sub>AUC-0.65 (CI: 0.54-0.75, <i>p</i> = 0.0081); R<sub>aVR</sub> > 4 mm-AUC 0.62 (CI: 0.52-0.71, <i>p</i> = 0.002) and P<sub>II</sub> > 2.5 mm-AUC 0.62 (CI: 0.52-0.72, <i>p</i> = 0.00162). Pulmonary vascular resistance significantly correlated with amplitudes of R<sub>V1</sub> (r = 0.34, <i>p</i> = 0.008), S<sub>V6</sub> (r = 0.53, <i>p</i> = 0.000027) and P<sub>II</sub> (r = 0.44, <i>p</i> = 0.00007). In patients with CTEPH, only 8 out of 23 ECG RVH criteria were useful for differentiating between proximal and distal CTEPH localization and we found that R<sub>V1</sub> and S<sub>V6</sub> may contribute as potential discriminators.","['chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension', 'clot localization', 'diagnosis', 'electrocardiogram', 'right ventricular hypertrophy']"
Persisting Motor Function Problems in School-Aged Survivors of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia.,"<b>Background and Objectives:</b> Children born with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and treated with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), are at risk for motor function impairment during childhood. We hypothesized that all children born with CDH are at risk for persistent motor function impairment, irrespective of ECMO-treatment. We longitudinally assessed these children's motor function. <b>Methods:</b> Children with CDH with and without ECMO-treatment, born 1999-2007, who joined our structural prospective follow-up program were assessed with the Movement Assessment Battery for Children (M-ABC) at 5, 8, 12 years. Z-scores were used in a general linear model for longitudinal analysis. <b>Results:</b> We included 55 children, of whom 25 had been treated with ECMO. Forty-three (78%) were evaluated at three ages. Estimated mean (95% CI) z-scores from the general linear model were -0.67 (-0.96 to -0.39) at 5 years of age, -0.35 (-0.65 to -0.05) at 8 years, and -0.46 (-0.76 to -0.17) at 12 years. The 5- and 8-years scores differed significantly (<i>p</i> = 0.02). Motor development was significantly below the norm in non-ECMO treated patients at five years; -0.44 (-0.83 to -0.05), and at all ages in the ECMO-treated-patients: -0.90 (-1.32 to -0.49), -0.45 (-0.90 to -0.02) and -0.75 (-1.2 to -0.34) at 5, 8, and 12 years, respectively. Length of hospital stay was negatively associated with estimated total z-score M-ABC (<i>p</i> = 0.004 multivariate analysis). <b>Conclusion:</b> School-age children born with CDH are at risk for motor function impairment, which persists in those who received ECMO-treatment. Especially for them long-term follow up is recommended.","['congenital diaphragmatic hernia', 'critical illness', 'development', 'followup', 'motor function']"
The Effect of Dexmedetomidine on Emergence Agitation or Delirium in Children After Anesthesia-A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Clinical Studies.,"<b>Background:</b> We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the clinical effect of dexmedetomidine in preventing pediatric emergence agitation (EA) or delirium (ED) following anesthesia compared with placebo or other sedatives. <b>Methods:</b> The databases of Pubmed, Embase, and Cochrane Library were searched until 8th January 2020. Inclusion criteria were participants with age<18 years and studies of comparison between dexmedetomidine and placebo or other sedatives. Exclusion criteria included adult studies; duplicate publications; management with dexmedetomidine alone; review or meta-analysis; basic research; article published as abstract, letter, case report, editorial, note, method, or protocol; and article presented in non-English language. <b>Results:</b> Fifty-eight randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and five case-control trials (CCTs) including 7,714 patients were included. The results showed that dexmedetomidine significantly decreased the incidence of post-anesthesia EA or ED compared with placebo [OR = 0.22, 95% CI: (0.16, 0.32), <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 75, <i>P</i> < 0.00001], midazolam [OR = 0.36, 95% CI: (0.21, 0.63), <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 57, <i>P</i> = 0.0003], and opioids [OR = 0.55, 95% CI: (0.33, 0.91), <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0, <i>P</i> = 0.02], whereas the significant difference was not exhibited compared with propofol (or pentobarbital) [OR = 0.56, 95% CI: (0.15, 2.14), <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 58, <i>P</i> = 0.39], ketamine [OR = 0.43, 95% CI: (0.19, 1.00), <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0, <i>P</i> = 0.05], clonidine [OR = 0.54, 95% CI: (0.20, 1.45), <i>P</i> = 0.22], chloral hydrate [OR = 0.98, 95% CI: (0.26, 3.78), <i>P</i> = 0.98], melatonin [OR = 1.0, 95% CI: (0.13, 7.72), <i>P</i> = 1.00], and ketofol [OR = 0.55, 95% CI: (0.16, 1.93), <i>P</i> = 0.35]. <b>Conclusion:</b> Compared with placebo, midazolam, and opioids, dexmedetomidine significantly decreased the incidence of post-anesthesia EA or ED in pediatric patients. However, dexmedetomidine did not exhibit this superiority compared with propofol and ketamine. With regard to clonidine, chloral hydrate, melatonin, and ketofol, the results needed to be further tested due to the fact that only one trial was included for each control drug.","['agitation', 'delirium', 'dexmedetomidine', 'metaanalysis', 'pediatric']"
Efficacy and safety of testosterone replacement therapy in men with hypogonadism: A meta-analysis study of placebo-controlled trials.,"The purpose of the present meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of testosterone replacement therapy in men with hypogonadism. A search was conducted for appropriate randomized controlled trials and the data from 16 trials were pooled. The intended primary outcome of the present study was to determine the efficacy and safety of testosterone replacement therapy. The current data demonstrated that scores for Aging Male Symptoms (AMS) were significantly reduced following testosterone replacement therapy, with a mean decrease in AMS score of 1.52 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.72 to 2.32; P=0.0002]. Testosterone replacement therapy increased lean body mass [mean difference (MD), 1.22; 95% CI, 0.33 to 2.11; P=0.007], reduced fat mass in a non-significantly manner (MD, -0.85; 95% CI, -1.74 to 0.04; P=0.06) and significantly reduced total cholesterol (MD, -0.16; 95% CI, -0.29 to -0.03; P=0.01). No significant differences were identified in body weight (MD, 0.09; 95% CI, -1.13 to 1.31; P=0.89), body mass index (MD, 0.10; 95% CI, -0.62 to 0.82; P=0.78) or bone mineral density (MD, -0.01; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.02; P=0.60). Average prostate volume increased (MD, 1.58; 95% CI, 0.6 to 2.56; P=0.002) following testosterone replacement therapy, but the levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (MD, 0.10; 95% CI, -0.03 to 0.22; P=0.14) and the International Prostate Symptom Scores (MD, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.37 to 0.39; P=0.96) did not change. In conclusion, testosterone replacement therapy improves quality of life, increases lean body mass, significantly decreases total cholesterol, and is well-tolerated and safe for men with hypogonadism who are exhibiting PSA levels of <4 ng/ml.","['endocrinology', 'hypogonadal men', 'testosterone replacement therapy']"
Automatic Detection and Classification of Multiple Catheters in Neonatal Radiographs with Deep Learning.,"We develop and evaluate a deep learning algorithm to classify multiple catheters on neonatal chest and abdominal radiographs. A convolutional neural network (CNN) was trained using a dataset of 777 neonatal chest and abdominal radiographs, with a split of 81%-9%-10% for training-validation-testing, respectively. We employed ResNet-50 (a CNN), pre-trained on ImageNet. Ground truth labelling was limited to tagging each image to indicate the presence or absence of endotracheal tubes (ETTs), nasogastric tubes (NGTs), and umbilical arterial and venous catheters (UACs, UVCs). The dataset included 561 images containing two or more catheters, 167 images with only one, and 49 with none. Performance was measured with average precision (AP), calculated from the area under the precision-recall curve. On our test data, the algorithm achieved an overall AP (95% confidence interval) of 0.977 (0.679-0.999) for NGTs, 0.989 (0.751-1.000) for ETTs, 0.979 (0.873-0.997) for UACs, and 0.937 (0.785-0.984) for UVCs. Performance was similar for the set of 58 test images consisting of two or more catheters, with an AP of 0.975 (0.255-1.000) for NGTs, 0.997 (0.009-1.000) for ETTs, 0.981 (0.797-0.998) for UACs, and 0.937 (0.689-0.990) for UVCs. Our network thus achieves strong performance in the simultaneous detection of these four catheter types. Radiologists may use such an algorithm as a time-saving mechanism to automate reporting of catheters on radiographs.","['Catheter detection', 'Deep learning', 'Pediatric', 'Xray']"
The Transition from Underwater to Surface Swimming During the Push-off Start in Competitive Swimmers.,"The objective of the present study was to analyze (based on gender and the style of swimming) the kinematic parameters of the transition phase between underwater swimming and surface swimming after the push-off start in competitive national swimmers. Seventy-four swimmers participating in the Spanish Swimming Championships were filmed and analyzed by DLT-2D photogrammetry during the start with the push-off in crawl, backstroke and butterfly styles. Between genders there were small differences in the distance and speed of transition. The male swimmers travelled greater distances (0.84 ± 0.04 vs. 0.66 ± 0.04 m, η2 = 0.05, F = 10.34, p < 0.001) and they were faster (1.59 ± 0.03 vs. 1.38 ± 0.03 m/s, η2 = 0.08, F = 19.54, p < 0.001) in the transition phase than female swimmers. Among styles there were greater differences in time (η2 = 0.47, F = 94.50, p < 0.001) and transition distance (η2 = 0.38, F = 67.08, p < 0.001), than in speed (η2 = 0.05, F = 5.63, p < 0.001). During the backstroke push-off, swimmers spent more time (0.88 ± 0.04 s) and distance (1.17 ± 0.05 m), this being the slowest style (1.37 ± 0.04 m/s). In butterfly, athletes used less time (0.26 ± 0.03 s) and distance (0.39 ± 0.05 m) whereas crawl was the fastest of all (1.57 ± 0.04 m/s). These results allow the phase of transition from underwater to surface swimming to be characterized and to provide useful data for competitive swimmers and coaches to improve performance.","['2D', 'biomechanics', 'direct linear transformation', 'kinematics', 'performance']"
Bevacizumab as adjuvant therapy in the management of pterygium: a systematic review and Meta-analysis.,"To evaluate the clinical effect of bevacizumab in pterygium treatment.A systematic review and quantitative Meta-analysis was performed. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane database were searched for eligible literatures published in English until June 2016. The endpoint was recurrence rate and pooled risk ratio (RR) was calculated.Nine eligible studies were included and Meta-analysis results showed no significantly difference in patients treated with bevacizumab in short term follow-up [3mo: RR=0.70 (0.34, 1.45); 6mo: RR=0.55 (0.23, 1.32)] compared with control groups. No significant effects were observed in favor of bevacizumab in subgroup analyses: patients with subconjunctival injection of bevacizumab [3mo: RR=0.95 (0.70, 1.29); 6mo: RR=0.83 (0.55, 1.28)], primary pterygium [3mo: RR=0.59 (0.23, 1.54; 6mo: RR=0.59 (0.23, 1.53)], simple pterygium excision [3mo: 0.32 (0.05, 2.04), <i>P</i>=0.23; 6mo: 0.27 (0.05, 1.53)] and excision with conjunctival autograft [3mo: 1.51 (0.25, 9.15); 6mo: 1.11 (0.06, 21.69)].In this Meta-analysis, we did not found the significant effect of bevacizumab in pterygium treatment, at least in short term follow-up (3mo and 6mo).","['Metaanalysis', 'bevacizumab therapy', 'pterygium', 'recurrence']"
Comparison of two methods for dimethylarginines quantification.,"Both dimethylarginines are widely bound to chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study was focused to validate published LC-MS/MS method and compared the measured data with an immunoassay.The analysis was performed on a Dionex UltiMate 3000 UHPLC-Standard (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) with an amaZon SL ion trap (Bruker, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA). Comparison was evaluated by using Passing Bablok regression and Bland Altman plot. Healthy volunteers (n = 40) were used for validation and as control group to patients group (n = 40) with different stages of CKD.The results in healthy controls determined by the LC-MS/MS (ELISA) method were 0.52 ± 0.0892 with 95 % CI: 0.49-0.55 (0.61 ± 0.1213 with 95 % CI: 0.57-0.64) μmol/L for AD MA and 0.56 ± 0.0810 with 95 % CI: 0.53-0.58 (0.62 ± 0.0752 with 95 % CI: 0.57-0.65) μmol/L for SDMA. In the same way, the patient group values determined by the LC-MS/MS (ELISA) method were 0.82 ± 0.1604 with 95 % CI: 0.75-0.88 (1.06 ± 0.3002 with 95 % CI: 0.94-1.19) μmol/L and 2.14 ± 0.8778 with 95 % CI: 1.47-2.58 (1.65 ± 0.5160 with 95 % CI: 1.40-1.98) μmol/L for ADMA and SDMA, respectively. The correlation between the methods, expressed as the Spearman correlation coefficient (R), was 0.858 (0.8059) for ADMA (p < 0.0001) and 0.895 (0.9607) for SDMA (p < 0.0001).ADMA levels determined by the immunoassay were almost 30 % overestimated, in contrast to SDMA levels, which were 3 % underestimated. According to our findings, a better correlation could be obtained by simple sample dilution.","['Asymmetric dimethylarginine', 'CKD', 'ELISA', 'LCMSMS', 'Symmetric dimethylarginine']"
Relationship between serum uric acid and estimated glomerular filtration rate in adolescents aged 12-19 years with different body mass indices: a cross-sectional study.,"Globally, chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing public health concern. Serum uric acid (SUA) is an easily detectable and readily available biochemical indicator that has long been recognized as an independent risk factor for CKD. In addition, studies have indicated a potential relationship between SUA and body mass index (BMI). However, studies on the effect of SUA levels on the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in adolescents with different BMIs are very rare.Weighted multiple regression analysis was used to estimate the independent relationship between SUA and log-transformed eGFR. Additionally, we used a weighted generalized additive model and smooth curve fitting to describe the nonlinear relationships in the subgroup analysis.First, SUA was negatively associated with log-transformed eGFR even after adjusting for all covariates (β=-0.0177, 95% CI: -0.0203-0.0151, P<0.0001). Second, the results of the stratified analysis found that after adjusting for all covariates, the decrease in log-transformed eGFR due to changes in per SUA levels (Per 1, mg/dL increase) was elevated in female adolescents (β=-0.0177, 95% CI: -0.0216, -0.0138, P<0.0001), adolescents aged 12-15 years (β=-0.0163, 95% CI: -0.0200, -0.0125, P<0.0001) and black (β=-0.0199, 95% CI: -0.0251, -0.0148, P<0.0001) adolescents. Furthermore, we found that adolescents with a higher BMI had higher SUA levels, and the effect of SUA on eGFR was significantly higher in underweight adolescents (β=-0.0386, 95% CI: (-0.0550, -0.0223), P<0.0001).SUA was negatively associated with the eGFR in adolescents aged 12-19 years. Furthermore, we found for the first time that SUA affects the eGFR differently in adolescents with different BMIs. This effect was particularly significant in underweight adolescents.","['BMI', 'NHANES', 'adolescents', 'estimated glomerular filtration rate', 'serum uric acid']"
Association of walking speed with cognitive function in Chinese older adults: A nationally representative cohort study.,"Slow walking speed has been shown to predict cognitive decline in older individuals, but studies conducted among Chinese older adults are scarce. We examined the association of walking speed with cognitive function and the trajectory of cognitive decline among Chinese adults aged 60 years and older.Data was from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), an ongoing nationally representative prospective cohort study. Walking speed was evaluated over a straight 2.5-meter flat course at baseline and categorized into tertiles (the lowest, middle, and highest). Cognitive function was assessed at each wave in three domains: episodic memory, mental status, and global cognition. Data were analyzed using linear mixed-effects models.A total of 3,954 older adults (48.6% female; mean age: 67.6 ± 5.55 years) were followed for up to 7 years. Participants with lowest walking speed have poorer episodic memory (<i>β</i> = -0.37; 95% CI: -0.46, -0.28), mental status (<i>β</i> = -0.45; 95% CI: -0.60, -0.29), and global cognition (<i>β</i> = -0.81; 95% CI: -1.03, -0.60) over the follow-up. Compared with the highest tertile of walking speed, the lowest walking speed was associated with a faster decline in episodic memory (<i>β</i> = -0.04; 95% CI: -0.07, -0.02), mental status (<i>β</i> = -0.04; 95% CI: -0.07, -0.01), and global cognition (<i>β</i> = -0.06; 95% CI: -0.11, -0.01).Slower walking speed is associated with subsequent risk of poorer cognitive function and faster cognitive decline in older Chinese adults.","['cognitive function', 'cohort study', 'national', 'older Chinese adults', 'walking speed']"
Alterations of optic tract and retinal structure in patients after thalamic stroke.,"To investigate the association between degeneration of retinal structure and shrinkage of the optic tract in patients after thalamic stroke.Patients with unilateral thalamic stroke were included. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed to obtain parameters of optic tract shrinkage (lateral index) and retina structural thickness (retinal nerve fiber layer, RNFL; peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer, pRNFL; ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer, GCIP), respectively. Visual acuity (VA) examination under illumination was conducted using Snellen charts and then converted to the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR). We investigated the association between LI and OCT parameters and their relationships with VA.A total of 33 patients and 23 age-sex matched stroke-free healthy controls were enrolled. Patients with thalamic stroke showed altered LI compared with control participants (<i>P</i> = 0.011) and a significantly increased value of LI in the subgroup of disease duration more than 6 months (<i>P</i> = 0.004). In these patients, LI were significantly associated with pRNFL thickness (β = 0.349, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.134-0.564, <i>P</i> = 0.002) after adjusting for confounders (age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and lesion volume). LI and pRNFL were both significantly associated with VA in all patients (LI: β = -0.275, 95% CI: -0.539 to -0.011, <i>P</i> = 0.041; pRNFL: β = -0.023, 95% CI: -0.046 to -0.001, <i>P</i> = 0.040) and in subgroup of disease duration more than 6 months (LI: β = -0.290, 95% CI: -0.469 to -0.111, <i>P</i> = 0.002; pRNFL: β = -0.041, 95% CI: -0.065 to -0.017, <i>P</i> = 0.003).Shrinkage of the optic tract can be detected in patients with thalamic stroke, especially after 6 months of stroke onset. In these patients, the extent of optic tract atrophy is associated with pRNFL thickness, and they are both related to visual acuity changes.","['MRI', 'OCT', 'optic tract', 'retinal structure', 'retrograde degeneration', 'thalamic stroke']"
Nine-year analysis of isolated pathogens and antibiotic susceptibilities of microbial keratitis from a large referral eye center in southern China.,"<b>Purpose:</b> To analyze the genus profile of isolated pathogens and antibiotic susceptibility trends of microbial keratitis over nine years at a large referral eye center in southern China. <b>Methods:</b> Data of corneal specimens from January 2010 to August 2018 of patients clinically diagnosed with infectious keratitis were obtained from the center's microbiology database. Results with positive cultures along with antibiotic susceptibility were reviewed and analyzed. <b>Results:</b> We collected and reviewed 7,229 specimens, including 3,092 with positive cultures. Among them, 1,630 (52.72%) were bacterial, 1781 (57.60%) were fungal, and 319 (10.32%) were coinfected. A significant decreasing trend was observed in the isolates of Gram-positive cocci (r =-0.711, <i>P</i>=0.032), among which the proportion of coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS) was also reduced (r =-0.883, <i>P</i>=0.002). In contrast, an increasing trend in the proportion of Gram-negative bacilli was observed (r=0.661, <i>P</i>=0.053). The susceptibility rates of Gram-positive cocci to cephalosporins were near 90%, which was relatively high compared to fluoroquinolones. Fluoroquinolones represented the antibiotics to which Gram-negative bacilli were the most susceptible. Their susceptibility to moxifloxacin was 78.79%. The overall performance of aminoglycosides and vancomycin was both around 70%. The susceptibility of Gram-positive cocci to several antibiotics including levofloxacin (r=-0.717, <i>P</i>=0.03), tobramycin (r= -0.933, <i>P</i><0.001), cefazolin (r= -0.964, <i>P</i><0.001), ceftazidime (r=-0.929, <i>P</i>=0.003), chloramphenicol (r=-0.929, <i>P</i>=0.003), and cefuroxime (r=-0.829, <i>P</i>=0.042) decreased over time. The susceptibility of Gram-negative bacilli to ofloxacin increased over time (r=0.854, <i>P</i>=0.004), whereas that to cefazolin (r=-0.833, <i>P</i>=0.005) and chloramphenicol (r=-0.886, <i>P</i>=0.019) decreased over time. <b>Conclusion:</b> From 2010 to 2018 in Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, most isolates from infectious keratitis were Gram-positive cocci (mainly CNS), which decreased over time, with an increase in Gram-positive bacilli. More than half of the antibiotics showed reducing trend of susceptibilities, and the antibiotic resistance situation in southern China was not encouraging.","['antibiotic resistance', 'bacterial keratitis', 'infectious keratitis', 'time trend']"
Model comparison to evaluate a shell quality bio-complex in layer hens.,"Reducing the incidence of egg shell breakage is an important selection goal in egg layer hens breeding. Breaking strength provides an indicator of static shell resistance correlated with shell thickness. Acoustic egg tests combine shell's resonance profile with egg mass to calculate dynamic stiffness (KDyn) a quantitative indicator of integral shell resistance, and a novel direct detection of both cracks and micro-cracks (MCr) making it possible for use in selection programs aiming improvement of shell quality. A shell quality bio-complex was defined to improve overall shell quality, including: breaking strength at equator (BSe) and poles (BSp), KDyn, and MCr, on multiple eggs/hen-age. A total of 81,667; 101,113; and 72,462 records from 4 generations of three pure lines were evaluated. Two models were tested in the brown-egg line: I) four-trait linear repeatability model and II) three-trait linear (BS, KDyn)-threshold (MCr) in the three lines. Models were implemented with AIREMLF90 and THRGIBBS1F90. Heritability and repeatability (Model I) estimates were: h<sup>2</sup> = 0.14, 0.18, 0.33, and 0.02; r = 0.16, 0.28, 0.43, and 0.03 for BSe, BSp, KDyn, and MCr, respectively. Corresponding values in White Plymouth Rock were h<sup>2</sup> = 0.14, 0.17, 0.33, and 0.02; r = 0.21, 0.33, 0.44, and 0.04, and in White Leghorn were h<sup>2</sup> = 0.14, 0.23, 0.36, and 0.02; r = 0.24, 0.38, 0.52, and 0.02. Genetic correlations between BSe and BSp were between 0.51 and 0.68. The BS traits were moderately correlated with KDyn (+0.23 to +0.51), and tended to be negatively correlated with MCr. KDyn, and MCr (-0.46 to -0.62). Model II had similar results; except for increased h<sup>2</sup> = 0.06 and r = 0.09 for MCr. Results indicate that BSe and BSp are different traits; while incidence of MCr is low in heritable but showed negative genetic correlations with the other traits. This makes MCr unsuitable for direct selection; but favors indirect selection against MCr via BSe, BSp, and KDyn for a holistic selection to improve shell quality, in particular to achieve the ultimate goal, reduction of egg breakage.","['egg quality', 'genetic parameters', 'layer hen', 'selection', 'shell quality']"
Environmental correlates of adolescent active travel to school in Asia: An ecological study.,"This study aimed to examine the association between country-level environmental correlates and the prevalence of active school travel (AST) in Asia and country-level differences in AST by age and sex.This ecological study involved 31 Asian countries. Dependent variables were AST prevalence, AST prevalence difference by age, and by sex. Independent variables were country-level environmental correlates extracted using publicly available datasets, classified into physical and social environments. Association estimates of each dependent variable and each of the independent variables were calculated using univariate linear regression. All variables were standardized to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.Results showed that 1 standard deviation (SD) difference in urban population percentage, night-time light, secondary-school enrolment, and prevalence of adult insufficient physical activity were negatively associated with AST prevalence (SD difference: -0.44 (-0.78 to -0.09), -0.40 (-0.76 to -0.04), -0.39 (-0.74 to -0.04), and -0.40 (-0.76 to -0.03), respectively). A 1 SD difference in car per people was associated with a -0.46 (-0.84 to -0.09) difference of AST prevalence by age. A 1 SD difference in PM2.5 concentration and of prevalence of adult insufficient physical activity were associated with a difference of 0.38 (0.01-0.74) and 0.42 (0.03-0.80) difference of AST prevalence by sex.This study shows that Asian countries with a greater number of people living in urban areas, lower levels of overall adult physical activity and higher levels of night-time light have a lower prevalence of adolescent AST. Country-level physical and social environmental correlates explained some of the regional variance in AST. Future policy actions and interventions for the region need to be contextually sensitive to the environmental correlates that vary between countries.","['Active school travel', 'Adolescents', 'Asia', 'Ecological study']"
"Migraine severity, disability, and duration: Is a good diet quality, high intake of phytochemicals and polyphenols important?","Dietary pattern may be the determinant of migraine prognosis through various mechanisms such as systemic inflammation, vasodilation, cerebral glucose metabolism, and mitochondrial dysfunction.This study was conducted to examine the relationship of the symptoms and signs of migraine with dietary polyphenols and the phytochemical intake and the quality of the diet.Individuals (<i>n</i> = 90), who were admitted to the headache outpatient clinic due to the diagnosis of episodic migraine, underwent physical examination by a neurologist. Migraine characteristics were assessed using the Migraine Disability Assessment Questionnaire and the Visual Analogue Scale. The Healthy Eating Index-2015 (HEI-2015) was used to evaluate the diet quality of individuals, and the Phytochemical Index developed by McCarty was used to determine the dietary intake of phytochemicals. Phenol-Explorer version 3.6 and the USDA Database for the Flavonoid Content of Selected Foods-Release 3.3 were used to calculate the dietary polyphenol intake.Migraine severity was negatively correlated with the intake of phytochemicals and good diet quality (<i>r</i> = -0.37, <i>p</i> = 0.0003; <i>r</i> = -0.37, <i>p</i> = 0.0003, respectively), and with the intake of phenolic components flavanones (<i>r</i> = -0.27, <i>p</i> = 0.01) and lignans (<i>r</i> = -0.27, <i>p</i> = 0.01). With respect to the food groups; migraine severity was found to be inversely correlated with the total phenol intake from olive oil, oil, and fruits (<i>r</i> = -0.26, <i>p</i> = 0.01; <i>r</i> = -0.21, <i>p</i> = 0.04; <i>r</i> = -0.24, <i>p</i> = 0.02, respectively), and the flavonoid intake from olive oil, oil, fruits, and vegetables (<i>r</i> = -0.26, <i>p</i> = 0.01; <i>r</i> = -0.26, <i>p</i> = 0.01; <i>r</i> = -0.35, <i>p</i> = 0.0007; <i>r</i> = -0.22, <i>p</i> = 0.04, respectively). Strikingly, fruit flavanone intake was correlated with low migraine severity (<i>r</i> = -0.39, <i>p</i> = 0.0002), and fruit flavanol intake was correlated with low migraine disability (<i>r</i> = -0.21, <i>p</i> = 0.04).A high-quality diet rich in phytochemicals and polyphenols (especially flavanones and lignans) is associated with low migraine severity. Lower intake of phenols and flavonoids from vegetable oil, olive oil, fruits, and vegetables were associated with more severe migraine attacks. Examination of migraine characteristics and dietary pattern together with phytochemical and polyphenol intake may guide the development of dietary strategies to be used in migraine patients.","['diet quality', 'headache', 'migraine', 'phytochemicals', 'polyphenol']"
Oxygen Vacancy and Valence Band Structure of Ba<sub>0.5</sub>Sr<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>1-x</sub>Cu<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3-δ</sub> (x = 0-0.15) with Enhanced ORR Activity for IT-SOFCs.,"The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity of a Cu-doped Ba<sub>0.5</sub>Sr<sub>0.5</sub>FeO<sub>3-δ</sub> (Ba<sub>0.5</sub>Sr<sub>0.5</sub>Fe<sub>1-x</sub>Cu<sub>x</sub>O<sub>3-δ</sub>, BSFCux, x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15) perovskite cathode was investigated in terms of oxygen vacancy formation and valence band structure. The BSFCux (x = 0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15) crystallized in a cubic perovskite structure (Pm3¯m). By thermogravimetric analysis and surface chemical analysis, it was confirmed that the concentration of oxygen vacancies in the lattice increased with Cu doping. The average oxidation state of B-site ions decreased from 3.583 (x = 0) to 3.210 (x = 0.15), and the valence band maximum shifted from -0.133 eV (x = 0) to -0.222 eV (x = 0.15). The electrical conductivity of BSFCux increased with temperature because of the thermally activated small polaron hopping mechanism showing a maximum value of 64.12 S cm<sup>-1</sup> (x = 0.15) at 500 °C. The ASR value as an indicator of ORR activity decreased by 72.6% from 0.135 Ω cm<sup>2</sup> (x = 0) to 0.037 Ω cm<sup>2</sup> (x = 0.15) at 700 °C. The Cu doping increased oxygen vacancy concentration and electron concentration in the valence band to promote electron exchange with adsorbed oxygen, thereby improving ORR activity.","['Ba05Sr05Fe1−xCuxO3−δ', 'areaspecific resistance', 'oxygen reduction reaction', 'oxygen vacancy', 'valence band']"
Agreement and reliability of lower limb muscle architecture measurements using a portable ultrasound device.,"High end ultrasonography devices lack in portability and are expensive. We investigated the agreement and reliability of a handheld and portable ultrasound system for human lower limb muscle architecture measurements. We captured ultrasound images of the rectus femoris (RF), vastus lateralis (VL) and gastrocnemius medialis (GM) in 36 active healthy participants (15 female, 21 male) at 50% of muscle length using the handheld Lumify (L12-4, linear-array 37 mm, Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, Netherlands) and a high-end laboratory device (ACUSON Juniper, linear-array 54 mm, 12L3, SIEMENS Healthineers, Erlangen, Germany). We compared measurements of muscle fascicle length, pennation angle and thickness. To assess inter-session reliability of the Lumify system, participants were measured twice within 1 week. Comparing RF architecture measurements of both devices resulted in intra-class correlations (ICCs) ranging from 0.46-0.82 and standardized mean difference (SMDs) ranging from -0.45-0.05. For VL, ICCs ranged from 0.60-0.89 and SMDs ranged from -0.11-0.13. ICCs and SMDs for the GM ranged from 0.82-0.86 and -0.07-0.07. Calculating inter-session reliability for RF resulted in ICCs ranging from 0.44-0.76 and SMDs ranging from -0.38-0.15. For VL, ICCs and SMDs ranged from 0.57-0.75 and -0.13-0.02. ICCs for GM ranged from 0.75-0.92 and SMDs ranged from -0.15-0.16. Measurement of muscle thickness demonstrated the highest agreement (ICC ≥0.82) and reliability (ICC ≥0.75) across all muscles. The Lumify system was comparable to a high-end device and reliable for GM measurements. However, agreement and reliability were lower for the RF and VL. Of all evaluated architectural parameters, muscle thickness exhibited highest agreement and reliability.","['comparabality', 'lower limbs', 'lumify', 'muscle architecture', 'reliability', 'ultrasound']"
The Influence of Sprint Mechanical Properties on Change of Direction in Female Futsal Players.,"The aim of the present study was to analyze the association of the sprint force-velocity profile [Hzt FV profile] variables with change of direction [COD] performance in female futsal players. Twelve female futsal players (age: 19.83 ± 4.2 years; body height: 160.75 ± 8.37 cm; body mass: 57.64 ± 8.3 kg) volunteered to be evaluated in the following assessments: Hzt FV profile, 505 test, modified 505 test [M505test] and V-cut test. The Spearman's correlation coefficient [r<sub>s</sub>] (p < 0.05) was used to determine the relationship of the mechanical variables of the sprint (maximum power output [P<sub>max</sub>], maximum horizontal force production [F<sub>0</sub>] and maximum velocity [V<sub>0</sub>]) with COD performance. V<sub>0</sub> showed a very large significant association with the 505 test (r<sub>s</sub> = -0.767; 90% CI: (-0.92 to -0.43); p < 0.01) and a large association with the V-cut test (r<sub>s</sub> = -0.641; 90% CI: (-0.86 to -0.21); p < 0.05), whereas P<sub>max</sub> was strongly associated with results of the 505 test (r<sub>s</sub> = -0.821; 90% CI: (-0.94 to -0.55); p < 0.01) and largely associated with the V-cut test results (r<sub>s</sub> = -0.596; 90% CI: (-0.84 to -0.14); p < 0.05). In conclusion, maximal power and velocity output during sprinting are determinant factors to successful COD in 180º and 45º cuts, thus, the Hzt FV profile should be assessed in female futsal players to better understand the influence of sprint mechanical properties on COD performance and prescribe individualized training programs.","['acceleration', 'power', 'strength', 'team sports', 'velocity']"
"Correlates of Indoor Concentration of Carbon Monoxide in Residential Buildings in Gondar Town, Northwest Ethiopia.","This community-based cross-sectional study was conducted to investigate the indoor concentration of carbon monoxide (CO) and associated factors in residential buildings of Gondar town, northwest Ethiopia. Data were collected from 384 occupied buildings and occupants using CO meter, interviewers administered questionnaire, and observation checklists. Multivariable binary logistic regression analysis was used for controlling the possible effect of confounders and to identify factors associated with indoor concentration of CO on the basis of adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) and <i>P</i> < .05. The current study revealed that 224(58.3%) occupied buildings had the concentration of CO above the permissible value for 15 minute exposure for living rooms (100 mg/m<sup>3</sup>). Indoor concentration of CO was significantly associated with access to health information [AOR = 0.081, 95%CI = (0.008, 0.803)], number of rooms [AOR = 0.016, 95% CI = (0.001, 0.279)], area of occupied room [AOR = 0.019, 95% CI = (0.001, 0.237)], buildings located away from main roads/garages [AOR = 0.045, 95% CI = (0.005, 0.415)], clean energy sources [AOR = 0.010, 95% CI = (0.001, 0.123)], presence of separate kitchen [AOR = 0.030, 95% CI = (0.004, 0.221)], no incensing in the room [AOR = 0.055, 95% CI = (0.006,0.499)] and measurements in the afternoon [AOR = 0.114, 95% CI = (0.013, 0.965)]. Residents, therefore, need to use clean energy sources, construct a kitchen with a properly constructed chimneys away from the main building, and avoid incensing inside the indoor environment.","['Carbon monoxide', 'indoor concentration', 'occupied rooms', 'permissible value for 15\u2009minute exposure']"
Correlation between thromboelastography and rotational thromboelastometry values in adult liver transplant recipients.,"Viscoelastic haemostatic assays (VHA) namely Thromboelastogram (TEG) and Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) are used for global assessment of coagulopathy and guiding transfusion during living donor liver transplant (LDLT).We conducted a study to compare the interchangeability of the values obtained from these devices in patients with End stage liver disease (ESLD) undergoing LDLT.In 76 patients undergoing LDLT, ROTEM and TEG were performed and assessed for interchangeability using Spearman Correlation. The direction and strength of correlation between equivalent parameters was calculated using Inter Class Correlation (ICC) and Bland Altman analysis.The correlation ρ between CT (clotting time) of ROTEM and R of TEG was 0.16 (<i>P</i> = 0.19).The ICC was 0.15, with 95% confidence interval (CI) of -0.38-0.48 (<i>P</i> = 0.25).The ρ of CFT (ROTEM) with K (TEG) was 0.425 (<i>P</i>=<0.001). The ICC was0.49 with 95% CI of 0.17-0.69, <i>P</i> = 0.003.Alpha of ROTEM correlated with Angle of TEG with ρ of 0.475 (<i>P</i>=<0.001). The ICC was 0.61, with 95% CI of 0.36-0.76, <i>P</i>=<0.001.Maximum Clot firmness (MCF) correlated with maximum amplitude (MA) with ρ=0.76 (<i>P</i>=<0.001).The ICC was 0.86, with 95% CI of 0.77-0.92, <i>P</i>=<0.001. Lysis index (L30) of ROTEM correlated clot lysis (CL30) of TEG with ρ of 0.16 (<i>P</i> = 0.18).However, the ICC was 0.45, with 95% CI of 0.11-0.66, <i>P</i> = 0.08. The correlation between CT of ROTEM and R of TEG as well as L30 of ROTEM and CL30 of TEG was not significant.The strongest correlation was found between MCF and MA (<i>P</i> < 0.001). However the MCF/MA showed an agreement of only 86% (ICC = 0.86).Values from ROTEM and TEG were not found to be interchangeable.","['Rotational thromboelastometry', 'thromboelastography', 'viscoelastic haemostatic assays']"
Association of inflammation and cognition in the elderly: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The development of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be associated with an inflammatory process. Inflammatory cytokines may be a surrogate for systemic inflammation leading to worsening neurological function. We aim to investigate the association between cognitive impairment and inflammation by pooling and analyzing the data from previously published studies.We performed a systematic literature search on MEDLINE, PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus for prospective longitudinal and cross-sectional studies evaluating the relationship between inflammation and cognitive functions.A total of 79 articles were included in our systematic review and meta-analysis. Pooled estimates from cross-sectional studies have demonstrated an increased level of C-reactive protein (CRP) [Hedges's g 0.35, 95% CI (0.16, 0.55), <i>p</i> < 0.05], IL-1β [0.94, 95% CI (-0.04, 1.92), <i>p</i> < 0.05], interleukin-6 (IL-6) [0.46, 95% CI (0.05, 0.88), <i>p</i> < 0.005], TNF alpha [0.22, 95% CI (-0.24, 0.68), <i>p</i> < 0.05], sTNFR-1 [0.74, 95% CI (0.46, 1.02), <i>p</i> < 0.05] in AD compared to controls. Similarly, higher levels of IL-1β [0.17, 95% CI (0.05, 0.28), <i>p</i> < 0.05], IL-6 [0.13, 95% CI (0.08, 0.18), <i>p</i> < 0.005], TNF alpha [0.28, 95% CI (0.07, 0.49), <i>p</i> < 0.05], sTNFR-1 [0.21, 95% CI (0.05, 0.48), <i>p</i> < 0.05] was also observed in MCI vs. control samples. The data from longitudinal studies suggested that levels of IL-6 significantly increased the risk of cognitive decline [OR = 1.34, 95% CI (1.13, 1.56)]. However, intermediate levels of IL-6 had no significant effect on the final clinical endpoint [OR = 1.06, 95% CI (0.8, 1.32)].The data from cross-sectional studies suggest a higher level of inflammatory cytokines in AD and MCI as compared to controls. Moreover, data from longitudinal studies suggest that the risk of cognitive deterioration may increase by high IL-6 levels. According to our analysis, CRP, antichymotrypsin (ACT), Albumin, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha may not be good surrogates for neurological degeneration over time.","['CRP', 'IL6', 'cognition', 'cytokines', 'elderly', 'inflammation']"
Three-dimensional mapping of peripapillary retinal layers using a spectral domain optical coherence tomography.,"To map and view the effects of age, gender, and axial length on seven individual retinal layers around the optic nerve head (ONH).We scanned 242 healthy patients using the Spectralis spectral domain optical coherence tomography in an outpatient setting. The layers were observed on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study sectors using the standard Spectralis Family Acquisition Module 6.0.11.0. The center was the ONH, the inner circle (IC) was 1-3 mm away, and the outer circle (OC) was 3-6 mm away. The seven layers were retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), outer plexiform layer (OPL), outer nuclear layer (ONL), and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Additionally, we calculated the mean thickness of two combined layers: inner retinal layer (IRL) and photoreceptor layer (PL). Finally, we measured the mean of the total retinal thickness (TRT).The TRT was highest at the inferior end in the IC and at the nasal end in the OC. The RPE (<i>p</i><0.001) and PL (<i>p</i><0.001) were thicker in males; however, the IRL (<i>p</i>=0.015) was thicker in females. We found that the RNFL (<i>p</i><0.001, <i>r</i>=0.139), GCL (<i>p</i><0.001, <i>r</i>=0.116), IPL (<i>p</i>=0.016, <i>r</i>=0.059), INL (<i>p</i><0.001, <i>r</i>=0.104), OPL (<i>p</i>=0.009, <i>r</i>=0.064), ONL (<i>p</i><0.001, <i>r</i>=0.157), RPE (<i>p</i>=0.001, <i>r</i>=0.079), IRL (<i>p</i><0.001, <i>r</i>=0.190), PL (<i>p</i>=0.030, <i>r</i>=0.053), and TRT (<i>p</i><0.001, <i>r</i>=0.191) correlated negatively with age. The axial length significantly and negatively correlated at the GCL (<i>p</i>=0.003, <i>r</i>=0.093), IPL (<i>p</i>=0.020, <i>r</i>=0.072), INL (<i>p</i>=0.018, <i>r</i>=0.073), ONL (<i>p</i><0.001, <i>r</i>=0.110), IRL (<i>p</i>=0.003, <i>r</i>=0.092), and TRT (<i>p</i>=0.003, <i>r</i>=0.094). We found poor reproducibility in the IC; however, this was excellent in the OC.We found significant differences in layers according to age, gender, and axial length. Additionally, reproducibility can be improved by altering the algorithm to account for the ONH parameters.","['age', 'gender', 'interferometry', 'optic nerve head', 'retinal segmentation', 'sex']"
Studying the correlations among hematological and serum biochemical constituents in cattle theileriosis.,"The present study was undertaken to investigate the influence of tropical theileriosis on serum constituents, erythrocytes and platelets pictures and to study the correlation between the studied parameters. A total number of 26 cows were subjected to study. Out of them 16 cows were suffered from theileria infection. Comparing theileria infected group with the control group revealed significant decreases in total RBCS counts (p < 0.01), haemoglobin concentration (p < 0.01), packed cell volume (PCV) (p < 0.01), platelets count (PLT) (p < 0.01), plateletcrit (PCT) (p < 0.01), significant decreases in serum total proteins (p < 0.01), albumin (p < 0.01), calcium (p < 0.01), and phosphorus (p < 0.01) levels, and significant increases in serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (p < 0.05) and creatinine (p < 0.05) levels, and in serum aspartate aminotransferase (p < 0.01) and gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) (p < 0.01) activities. Correlations between serum biochemical parameters revealed significant positive correlations between total proteins and albumin (r = 0.598*), A/G ratio and albumin (r = 0.860**), calcium and albumin (r = 0.729*), calcium and A/G ratio (r = 0.752*), GGT and BUN (r = 0.539*), and significant negative correlations between A/G ratio and globulins (r = -0.809**) and between glucose and albumin (r = -0.614*). Erythrocytes count showed a significant negative correlation with mean corpuscular volume (MCV) (r = -0.966**) and red blood cells distribution width (RDW) (r = -0.909**). MCV showed a significant positive correlation with RDW (r = 0.860*) and PCV (r = 0.781*). RDW was positively correlated with PCV (r = 0.966**). PLT count showed a significant positive correlation with mean platelet volume (MPV) (r = 0.992**), platelets distribution width (PDW) (r = 0.956**) and PCT (r = 0.994**). Furthermore, MPV showed a significant positive correlation with PDW (r = 0.940**) and a negative correlation with PCT (r = -0.974**). PDW was negatively correlated with PCT (r = -0.974**). It could be concluded that theileria infection in cattle resulted in anaemia, thrombocytopenia, hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminaemia and hypophosphataemia, in addition to hepatic and kidney dysfunction.","['Cow', 'Erythrocytes', 'Platelets', 'Serum', 'Theileria']"
The effects of pre-task music on exercise performance and associated psycho-physiological responses: a systematic review with multilevel meta-analysis of controlled studies.,"This systematic review summarized the studies that examined the pre-task music effects on performance aspects and quantitatively analyzed their outcomes. A systematic search for controlled studies investigating the acute effects of pre-task music on physical performance, cognitive aspects and associated psycho-physiological responses was performed through Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Library databases up to 17 May 2023, with thirty studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Data was analyzed using the robust multilevel meta-analysis model of standardized mean difference ""SMD"" with 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) and prediction intervals (PI) were reported. Pre-task music induced improvements of completion time (SMD = -0.24; 95% CI = -0.46 to -0.01; PI = -0.82 to 0.35; <i>p</i> = 0.04), relative mean power (RMP) (SMD = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.16 to 0.60; PI = -0.36 to 1.12; <i>p</i> = 0.003) and fatigue (SMD = -0.20; 95% CI = -0.32 to -0.09; PI = -0.36 to -0.05; <i>p</i> = 0.01), moderate effects on relative peak power (RPP) (SMD = 0.53; 95% CI = 0.21 to 0.85; PI = -0.42 to 1.48; <i>p</i> = 0.005), and high effect on feeling scale (FS) (SMD = 2.42; 95% CI = 0.52 to 4.31; PI = -11.43 to 16.26; <i>p</i> = 0.03). Greater benefits were recorded in jumping performance in males than females (<i>p</i> = 0.01), and for active than trained subjects for completion time (<i>p</i> = 0.02), RPP (<i>p</i> = 0.02) and RMP (<i>p</i> = 0.03). Larger benefits were obtained for FS post-warming up than after testing (<i>p</i> = 0.04). Self-selected music induced greater effects than pseudo- and pre-selected for performance decrement index (<i>p</i> = 0.05) and FS (<i>p</i> = 0.02). It could be concluded that pre-task music improved psychological responses and fatigue-related symptoms associated with exercise performance enhancement.","['ergogenic aid', 'exercise', 'motivation', 'music', 'warmup']"
Assessment of agreement using the equine glandular gastric disease grading system in 84 cases.,"Equine glandular gastric disease (EGGD) is a common condition causing signs of gastric pain although lesions are highly variable in their appearance. The only definitive method to diagnose EGGD ante-mortem is gastroscopy. The current recommended method for describing these lesions is the European College of Equine Internal Medicine (ECEIM) guidelines; however, repeatability between users is variable. This study aimed to validate the reliability of lesion descriptions using ECEIM consensus guidelines, using four blinded equine internal medicine diplomates.Ninety-two horses with EGGD with pre- and post-treatment gastroscopy images were identified using the electronic record at a UK equine hospital between 2012 and 2019. Eight horses were excluded due to non-diagnostic images. Four blinded observers used the recommended grading system to describe images and outcomes. Intraclass correlation coefficients and Krippendorff's alpha were used to determine reliability and agreement, respectively.Intraclass correlation coefficient for severity was 0.782 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.722-0.832), for distribution was 0.671 (95% CI 0.540-0.763), for the descriptor raised was 0.635 (95% CI 0.479-0.741), fibrinosuppurative was 0.745 (95% CI 0.651-0.812), haemorrhagic was 0.648 (95% CI 0.513-0.744), hyperaemic was 0.389 (95% CI 0.232-0.522) and for outcome was 0.677 (95% CI 0.559-0.770). Krippendorff's alpha for severity was 0.466 (95% CI 0.466-0.418), for distribution was 0.304 (95% CI 0.234-0.374), for the descriptor raised was 0.268 (95% CI 0.207-0.329), fibrinosuppurative was 0.406 (95% CI 0.347-0.463), haemorrhagic was 0.287 (95% CI 0.229-0.344), hyperaemic was 0.112 (95% CI 0.034-0.188) and for outcome was 0.315 (95% CI 0.218-0.408). There was moderate reliability determined between observers using intra-class correlation coefficients and unacceptable agreement determined between observers using Krippendorff's alpha.These results suggest that the current grading system is not comparable between observers, indicating the need to review the grading system or define more robust criteria.","['ECEIM guidelines', 'equine', 'equine glandular gastric disease EGGD', 'grading system']"
The value of a post-polio syndrome self-management programme.,"Post-polio syndrome is characterised by symptoms of fatigue, pain and new-onset neuromuscular weakness, and emerges decades after the initial poliovirus infection. We sought to evaluate the only post-polio syndrome specific self-management programme in the United Kingdom.This was a retrospective study of patients who had completed a residential self-management programme led by a multi-disciplinary clinical team. Following a confirmed diagnosis of post-polio syndrome by rehabilitation and neurology specialists, patients were offered to participate in the programme. Although group-based, patients also received individually tailored support on physical exercise and fatigue management. Physical effects, physical function, psychosocial well-being measures were assessed at baseline and 6 months follow-up. Knowledge was tested at baseline and immediately following the programme. Statistical comparisons were made using paired t-test and Wilcoxon signed rank test according to the data distribution.Over a period of 17 years, 214 participants (median age 61.3 years old, 63% female) attended 31 programmes. At 6 months the following post-polio syndrome specific symptoms improved significantly: fatigue, as measured by the Multidimensional Assessment of Fatigue scale [37.6 (7.1) <i>vs</i>. 34.2 (9.3), P=0.005]; and pain [15.0 (6.1) <i>vs</i>. 13.1 (6.7), P=0.001], atrophy [10.0 (8.0-12.0) <i>vs</i>. 9.0 (7.0-11.0), P=0.002] and bulbar symptoms [3.0 (1.0-5.0) <i>vs</i>. 2.0 (0-4.0), P=0.003] as measured by the Index of Post-polio Sequelae scale. Knowledge related to post-polio syndrome also significantly increased [14.0 (11.0-16.0) <i>vs</i>. 17.0 (16.0-19.0), P=0.001]. Participants were able to walk at a faster speed over 10 meters [0.77 (0.59-1.00) <i>vs</i>. 0.83 (0.67-1.10) m/s, P=0.003] and walked longer distances during the 2-minute walk test [76.9 (31.7) <i>vs</i>. 82.0 (38.4) m, P=0.029]. Depression and anxiety scores did not change over time [PHQ-9, 2.0 (0.3-10.8) <i>vs</i>. 2.0 (0.3-6.8), P=0.450; GAD-7, 2.0 (0-7.0) <i>vs</i>. 1.0 (0-3.0), P=0.460] nor was there change in self-reported quality of life {60 [50-70] <i>vs</i>. 60 [55-70], P=0.200}.This study suggests that a post-polio syndrome self-management programme led to improvement in symptoms, knowledge and walking speed, but not quality of life. Anxiety and depression scores remained low.","['Rehabilitation', 'fatigue', 'postpolio syndrome PPS', 'quality of life QoL']"
A Mendelian Randomization Study: Roles of Gut Microbiota in Sepsis - Who is the Angle?,"Gut microbiota (GM) is a crucial underlying player during sepsis pathogenesis. However, the causal relationship is unclear and remains to be determined. A two-sample Mendelian randomization study was implemented. The statistical data about sepsis together with GM summarized from genome-wide association studies were evaluated. Instrumental variables were defined as single-nucleotide polymorphisms with prominent correlations with exposure. The inverse-variance-weighted test was employed as a major approach of Mendelian randomization analysis to estimate of causal relationships. The inverse-variance-weighted analysis results demonstrated that at different taxa levels, Actinobacteria and <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> influence sepsis. Actinobacteria had negative relationships to sepsis risk at the phylum (β = -0.34, SE = 0.10, <i>p</i> = 0.0008) and class (β = -0.23, SE = 0.07, <i>p</i> = 0.0011) levels in outcome coded ieu-b-69. Actinobacteria at the phylum level (β = -0.22, SE = 0.10, <i>p</i> = 0.027) was also negatively associated with sepsis in outcome coded ieu-b-4980. <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i> at the order (β = -0.20, SE = 0.06, <i>p</i> = 0.0021), family (β = -0.20, SE = 0.06, <i>p</i> = 0.0021), and genus (β = -0.20, SE = 0.06, <i>p</i> = 0.0007) levels were all negatively correlated with the risk of sepsis in outcome coded ieu-b-69. The results of the Wald ratio model showed that <i>Tyzzerella</i> genus (OR (95%CI) = 0.6902[0.4907,0.9708], <i>p</i> = 0.0331) and Gastranaerophilales order (OR (95%CI) = 0.5907[0.3516,0.9926], <i>p</i> = 0.0468) were negatively connected with sepsis. This study implied at different taxa levels Actinobacteria and <i>Bifidobacteriaceae</i>, <i>Tyzzerella</i> genus, and Gastranaerophilales order have a causal relationship with sepsis, indicating that they are protective factors for the incidence of sepsis.","['Mendelian randomization', 'causal relationship', 'gut microbiota', 'sepsis']"
"Association of One-Carbon Metabolism-Related Vitamins (Folate, B6, B12), Homocysteine and Methionine With the Risk of Lung Cancer: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","<b>Background:</b> Studies on serum one-carbon metabolism factors (folate, B6, B12, homocysteine, and methionine) with lung cancer (LC) risk have produced inconsistent results. We aimed to systematically evaluate the association between them. <b>Methods:</b> This study was reported in accordance with the PRISMA Statement and was registered with PROSPERO (no. CRD42018086654). Relevant studies were searched in PubMed, Embase, MEDLINE, and CNKI up to February 2018. Random-effects models were used to estimate the pooled standardized mean differences (SMD) or odds ratios (OR), as well as their 95% confidence interval (CI). Sensitivity and subgroup analysis were performed to identify the source of heterogeneity. Publication bias was also assessed. <b>Results:</b> A total of 14 articles (8,097 patients) were included. The concentration of serum folate and vitamin B6 of LC patients were lower than the controls [SMD -0.53, 95% CI (-0.70, -0.35), <i>p</i> = 0.001 and SMD -0.28, 95%CI (-0.53, -0.02), <i>p</i> = 0.001, respectively]. While the concentration of homocysteine of the cases was higher than the controls [SMD 0.41, 95% CI (0.24, 0.59), <i>p</i> = 0.001]. However, there were no significant differences between LC patients and the controls in terms of vitamin B12 and methionine [SMD -0.09, 95% CI (-0.27, 0.09), <i>p</i> = 0.202 and SMD -0.13, 95% CI (-0.36, 0.10), <i>p</i> = 0.001]. Subgroup analysis showed that these results were more significant in Europe, Asia, former and current smokers, and the male population (<i>p</i>-value < 0.05). <b>Conclusions:</b> Serum folate and vitamin B6 might be protective factors against lung carcinogenesis and homocysteine could contribute to LC risk.","['folate vitamin B9', 'lung cancer', 'metaanalysis', 'onecarbon metabolism', 'serum', 'vitamin B6']"
The effects of bisphosphonates on osteoporotic patients after lumbar fusion: a meta-analysis.,"We conducted a meta-analysis of controlled clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of bisphosphonates in lumbar fusion.Bisphosphonates reduce bone resorption and remodeling by osteoclast activity inhibition, inactivation, and apoptosis. However, it remains controversial whether bisphosphonate therapy affects spinal fusion.We searched MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, ScienceDirect, EMBASE, and Google Scholar to identify studies reporting the effects of bisphosphonates on osteoporotic patients after lumbar fusion. Secondary sources were identified from the references of the included literature. Pooled data were analyzed using RevMan 5.1.Seven studies met the inclusion criteria. There were significant differences in solid intervertebral fusion (RD=0.07, 95% CI: -0.00 to 0.15, <i>P</i>=0.05), subsequent VCFs (RD=-0.21, 95% CI: -0.30 to -0.12, <i>P</i><0.00001), pedicle screw loosening (RD=-0.17, 95% CI: -0.28 to -0.05, <i>P</i>=0.006), and cage subsidence (RD=-0.25, 95% CI: -0.42 to -0.07, <i>P</i>=0.005) between two groups. No significant differences between two groups were found regarding implant fixation failure (RD=-0.06, 95% CI: -0.22 to 0.10, <i>P</i>=0.48).This meta-analysis showed that bisphosphonates may increase solid intervertebral fusion and decrease subsequent VCFs, pedicle screw loosening, and cage subsidence.","['bisphosphonates', 'fusion', 'lumbar', 'metaanalysis']"
Genetic parameters of rumination time and feed efficiency traits in primiparous Holstein cows under research and commercial conditions.,"Feed efficiency has the potential to be improved both through feeding, management, and breeding. Including feed efficiency in a selection index is limited by the fact that dry matter intake (DMI) recording is only feasible under research facilities, resulting in small data sets and, consequently, uncertain genetic parameter estimates. As a result, the need to record DMI indicator traits on a larger scale exists. Rumination time (RT), which is already recorded in commercial dairy herds by a sensor-based system, has been suggested as a potential DMI indicator. However, RT can only be a DMI indicator if it is heritable, correlates with DMI, and if the genetic parameters of RT in commercial herd settings are similar to those in research facilities. Therefore, the objective of our study was to estimate genetic parameters for RT and the related traits of DMI in primiparous Holstein cows, and to compare genetic parameters of rumination data between a research herd and 72 commercial herds. The estimated heritability values were all moderate for DMI (0.32-0.49), residual feed intake (0.23-0.36), energy-corrected milk (ECM) yield (0.49-0.70), and RT (0.14-0.44) found in the research herd. The estimated heritability values for ECM were lower for the commercial herds (0.08-0.35) than that for the research herd. The estimated heritability values for RT were similar for the 2 herd types (0.28-0.32). For the research herd, we found negative individual level correlations between RT and DMI (-0.24 to -0.09) and between RT and RFI (-0.34 to -0.03), and we found both positive and negative correlations between RT and ECM (-0.08 to 0.09). For the commercial herds, genetic correlations between RT and ECM were both positive and negative (-0.27 to 0.10). In conclusion, RT was not found to be a suitable indicator trait for feed intake and only a weak indicator of feed efficiency.","['feed efficiency', 'genetics', 'rumination time']"
Noninvasive assessment of the right and left ventricular function in neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia with persistent pulmonary hypertension before and after surgical repair.,"To measure right and left ventricular function in neonates with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) and persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) before and after surgical repair.Ten newborns with CDH and PPHN before and after surgical repair and 24 normal newborns underwent Doppler echocardiographic measurements of the systolic time intervals (STI) and the index of myocardial performance (IMP) or Tei Index to assess pulmonary hypertension and ventricular function, respectively.In newborns with CDH and PPHN before surgical repair, STI pre-ejection time/ejection time ratio and pre-ejection time/acceleration time ratio (0.39 ± 0.19 and 1.22 ± 0.6) were significantly prolonged when compared to newborns with CDH and PPHN after surgical repair (0.21 ± 0.05 and 0.80 ± 0.2) and normal newborns (0.20 ± 0.04 and 0.59 ± 0.2), respectively (all p < 0.001). Left IMP and right IMP were also significantly prolonged in newborns with CDH and PPHN before surgery (0.38 ± 0.16 and 0.53 ± 0.25) when compared to newborns with CDH and PPHN after surgery (0.30 ± 0.07 and 0.28 ± 0.13) and normal newborns (0.26 ± 0.09 and 0.20 ± 0.10), respectively (p < 0.05, left IMP) and (p < 0.001, right IMP).Significant pulmonary hypertension and abnormal left and right ventricular function were found in newborns with CDH and PPHN before surgical repair when compared to the newborns with CDH and PPHN after surgical repair and normal newborns. The STI and the IMP or Tei index can accurately estimate the consequences of pulmonary hypertension and left and right ventricular function in neonates with CDH and PPHN, which may affect management in these critically ill neonates.","['Congenital diaphragmatic hernia', 'index of myocardial performance', 'neonate', 'persistent pulmonary hypertension', 'systolic time intervals', 'ventricular function']"
"Comparison of mortality and short-term outcomes between classic, intubation-surfactant-extubation, and less invasive surfactant administration methods of surfactant replacement therapy.","Intubation-Surfactant-Extubation (InSurE) and less invasive surfactant administration (LISA) are alternative surfactant replacement therapy methods for reducing the complications associated with invasive mechanical ventilation. This study aimed to compare the Classic, InSurE, and LISA methods in Very-Low-Birth-Weight infants (VLBWIs) in South Korea.The Korean Neonatal Network (KNN) enrolled VLBWIs born between January 1, 2019 and December 31, 2020. They were analyzed retrospectively to compare the duration of respiratory support, length of hospitalization, mortality, and short-term outcomes of the three groups.The duration of invasive ventilator support was shorter in the following order: InSurE (3.99 ± 11.93 days), LISA (8.78 ± 29.32 days), and the Classic group (22.36 ± 29.94 days) (<i>p</i> = 0.014, <i>p</i> < 0.01) and InSurE had the shortest hospitalization (64.91 ± 24.07 days, <i>p</i> < 0.05) although the results couldn't adjust for confounding factor because of irregular distribution. InSurE had the lower risk of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) grade II-IV [odds ratio (OR) 0.524 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.287-0.956], <i>p</i> = 0.035] than in the Classic group. Mortality was lower in the InSurE [OR 0.377 (95% CI: 0.146-0.978), <i>p</i> = 0.045] and LISA [OR 0.296 (95% CI: 0.102-0.862), <i>p</i> = 0.026] groups than in the Classic group.

Associations of Adherence to the 2018 World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research Dietary Recommendations with Gut Microbiota and Inflammation Levels.,"Whether the World Cancer Research Fund and the American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR) dietary recommendations affect the gut microbiota and inflammatory status remains unclear. We examined the association of dietary adherence scores to the WCRF/AICR with gut microbiota and inflammation in a cross-sectional setting.The WCRF/AICR diet adherence scores were calculated for 151 participants (adenoma 97, non-adenoma 54) from 7-day dietary records. The gut microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples. The levels of inflammatory biomarkers in both blood (i.e., IL-6, IL-8, IgA, IgM, and IgG) and fecal samples (i.e., FCP) were evaluated in 97 colorectal adenoma patients who had blood samples available. Multivariable linear regression analyses were conducted to examine the association of individual and total dietary adherence scores with gut microbiota and inflammatory biomarker levels.Participants with higher adherence had lower relative abundance of <i>Proteobacteria</i> (<i>β</i> = -0.041, 95%<i>CI</i>: -0.073, -0.009), <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> (<i>β</i> = -0.035, 95%<i>CI</i>: -0.067, -0.003), and unidentified <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i> at the genus level (<i>β</i> = -0.029, 95%<i>CI</i>: -0.055, -0.003) compared to those with lower adherence. Plant-based food intake was positively correlated with increased abundance of <i>Phascolarctobacterium</i> (<i>β</i> = 0.013, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.001, 0.026). Restricting fast food was linked to high abundance of <i>Bacteroidaceae</i> (<i>β</i> = 0.149, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.040, 0.257) and <i>Bacteroides</i> (<i>β</i> = 0.149, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.040, 0.257). Limiting sugary drinks was associated with reduced abundance of <i>Lachnospiraceae</i> (<i>β</i> = -0.155, 95%<i>CI</i>: -0.292, -0.018). Plant-based food intake (<i>β</i> = -0.251, 95%<i>CI</i>: -0.450, -0.052) and restriction of fast food (<i>β</i> = -0.226, 95%<i>CI</i>: -0.443, -0.008) were associated with reduced IGG levels in men. Alcohol restriction was linked to lower IL-6 (<i>β</i> = -7.095, 95%<i>CI</i>: -11.286, -2.903) and IL-8 (<i>β</i> = -7.965, 95%<i>CI</i>: -14.700, -1.230) levels in women, but with higher IL-6 (<i>β</i> = 0.918, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.161, 1.675) levels in men.Our findings support the association of adherence to the WCRF/AICR diet with gut microbiota and inflammation. These results need to be validated in additional prospective or interventional studies.","['WCRFAICR', 'adenoma', 'colorectal cancer', 'diet', 'gut microbiota', 'inflammation']"
Terminal Crossbreeding of Murciano-Granadina Goats with Boer Bucks: Characteristics of the Carcass and the Meat.,"After verifying productive improvements from the crossbreeding (MB) of Boer males with females of the Murciano-Granadina (MG) breed, the aim of this work was to determine its consequences on the carcass and meat characteristics of suckling kids (9 kg of weight at slaughter) of both sexes. A total of 94 kids (25 purebred MG males, 19 purebred MG females, 25 crossed MB males and 25 crossed MB females) were used. It was found that MB kids reached slaughter weight at a younger age (44 ± 1 vs. 63 ± 1 days, p < 0.001). For carcass yield, the interaction genotype x sex was observed, where MB females presented a higher value (51.71 ± 0.34%) than the rest of the animals (MB males 50.53 ± 0.34, p < 0.05; MG males 50.60 ± 0.34, p < 0.05; MG females 49.62 ± 0.39, p < 0.001). MB kids had greater leg compactness, (36.28 ± 0.27 vs. 34.71 ± 0.29 g/cm, p < 0.001), slightly improved expensive carcass cuts (75.93 ± 0.31 vs. 74.77 ± 0.34%, p = 0.014) and higher muscle/bone (2.93 ± 0.03 vs. 2.76 ± 0.03, p < 0.001) and meat/bone ratios (3.56 ± 0.04 vs. 3.36 ± 0.04, p < 0.001) than MG kids. They also showed a somewhat more intense red colour (8.57 ± 0.25 vs. 7.74 ± 0.27, p = 0.027), higher colour saturation (9.06 ± 0.24 vs. 8.20 ± 0.26, p = 0.016) and less meat firmness (1.95 ± 0.08 vs. 2.23 ± 0.081 kg/cm2, p = 0.021). On the other hand, males had a slightly improved proportion of expensive cuts (75.98 ± 0.31 vs. 74.73 ± 0.34, p = 0.008), but their carcass contained a higher proportion of bone (22.16 ± 0.21 vs. 21.17 ± 0.17%; p < 0.001), a lower proportion of intermuscular fat (9.54 ± 0.24 vs. 10.93 ± 0.24, p < 0.001), a higher muscle/fat ratio (5.01 ± 0.10 vs. 4.41 ± 0.10, p < 0.001) and lower muscle/bone (2.80 ± 0.03 vs. 2.89 ± 0.03%, p = 0.016) and meat/bone ratios (3.36 ± 0.04 vs. 3.56 ± 0.04%, p < 0.001) than females. There were no sensory differences in any case. It is concluded that this crossbreeding strategy also improves the carcass and meat characteristics, making it a valid alternative to improve the productive results of MG dairy goat herds.","['Boer', 'MurcianoGranadina', 'carcass quality', 'meat quality', 'suckling kids']"
Time-dependent propensity-matched general population study of the effects of statin use on cancer risk in an interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis cohort.,"To determine the effect of statins on risk of cancer in patients with interstitial lung disease (ILD) and pulmonary fibrosis.We retrospectively enrolled patients with ILD and pulmonary fibrosis and divided them into two cohorts by statin use (statin users (n=10 036) and statin non-users (n=10 036)).We selected patients with ILD and pulmonary fibrosis (N=53 862) from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database. Time-dependent Cox models were used to compare risk of cancer of propensity-matched statin users and non-users. Cumulative cancer incidence was analysed through Cox proportional regression. We calculated adjusted HRs (aHRs) and their 95% CIs for cancer after adjusting for sex, age, comorbidities, and use of inhaled corticosteroids, oral steroids and statins.Compared with statin non-users, the aHRs (95% CIs) for statin users were 0.60 (0.55 to 0.65) for cancer, 0.52 (0.35 to 0.78) for haematological malignancy, 0.52 (0.38 to 0.72) for cancer of the head and neck, 0.73 (0.59 to 0.89) for colorectal cancer, 0.34 (0.26 to 0.43) for liver cancer, 0.39 (0.23 to 0.67) for pancreatic cancer, 0.40 (0.17 to 0.96) for skin cancer, 0.67 (0.52 to 0.87) for breast cancer, 0.27 (0.14 to 0.54) for cervical cancer, 0.37 (0.30 to 0.46) for other immunological cancers, 0.73 (0.54 to 0.98) for bladder/kidney cancer and 0.88 (0.71 to 1.09) for lung cancer.Statin use is associated with lower risk of cancer in the ILD and pulmonary fibrosis cohort.","['epidemiology', 'respiratory medicine see thoracic medicine', 'rheumatology']"
Comparison between endoscopic sphincterotomy <i>vs</i> endoscopic sphincterotomy associated with balloon dilation for removal of bile duct stones: A systematic review and meta-analysis based on randomized controlled trials.,"To compare gallstones removal rate and incidence of bleeding, pancreatitis, use of mechanical lithotripsy, cholangitis and perforation between isolated sphincterotomy <i>vs</i> sphincterotomy associated with balloon dilation of papilla in choledocholithiasis through the meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.We conducted a systematic review according to the PRISMA guidelines. Literature search was restricted to randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on MedLine, Cochrane Library, LILACS, and EMBASE database platforms in July 2017. The manual search included references of retrieved articles. We extracted data focusing on outcomes: The primary endpoint was the stones removal rate; Secondary endpoints were rates of pancreatitis, bleeding, use of mechanical lithotripsy (ML), perforation and cholangitis.Eleven RCTs with 1824 patients were included. EST was associated with more post-endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) bleeding [FE RD-0.02, CI (-0.03, -0.00), <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 33%, <i>P</i> = 0.05] and more need of mechanical lithotripsy in general [RE RD-0.16, CI (-0.25, -0.06), <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 90%, <i>P</i> = 0.002] and in subgroup analysis of stones greater than 15 mm [RE RD-0.20, CI (-0.38, -0.02), <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 82%, <i>P</i> = 0.003]. Incidence of pancreatitis [FE RD-0.01, CI (-0.03, 0.01), <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0, <i>P</i> = 0.36], cholangitis [FE RD-0.00, CI (-0.01, 0.01), <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> =0, <i>P</i> = 0.97] and perforation [FE RD-0.01, CI (-0.01, 0.00), <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0, <i>P</i> = 0.23] was similar between the groups as well as similar stone removal rates in general [FE RD-0.01, CI (-0.01, 0.04), <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 0, <i>P</i> = 0.23] and pooled analysis of stones greater than 15 mm [FE RD-0.02, CI (-0.02, 0.07), <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> = 11%, <i>P</i> = 0.31].Through meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials we found that isolated sphincterotomy was associated with more post-ERCP bleeding and more need for mechanical lithotripsy. However, there was no statistical difference in the stone removal rate between isolated sphincterotomy and sphincterotomy associated with balloon dilation in the approach to remove gallstones.","['Cholangiography', 'Cholangiopancreatography', 'Dilation', 'Endoscopic retrograde', 'Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography', 'Papillotomy', 'Sphincterotomy']"
Multicentre Prospective Study Analysing Relevant Factors Related to Marginal Bone Loss: A Two-Year Evolution.,"The aim of this prospective descriptive study was to analyse the possible variables associated with marginal bone loss in rehabilitated implants (Proclinic S.A.U, Zaragoza, Spain) two years after their prosthetic loading.Three clinical centres collaborated for a period of two years after the prosthetic rehabilitation of the implants (Proclinic S.A.U, Zaragoza, Spain), in which marginal bone loss and the possible associated variables were evaluated. The collection form comprised different variables throughout different stages of the implant procedure, from implant insertion to the subsequent prosthetic rehabilitation, over a two-year period. Data of the patients and implant characteristics were studied. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS for qualitative (univariate logistic regressions, Chi2 test, and Haberman's corrected standardised residuals) and quantitative variables (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).The total study sample consisted of 218 implants (Proclinic S.A.U, Zaragoza, Spain). The sample presented a frequency of 99 men (45.4%) and 119 women (54.6%). The mean age of the patients among the reported cases was 58.56 ± 10.12 years. A statistically significant association was found between marginal bone loss 2 years after prosthetic rehabilitation placement and several variables, including age (under 55 years, 0.25 mm ± 0.56; 55-64 years, 0.74 mm ± 0.57; over 65 years, 0.63 mm ± 0.55; <i>p</i> < 0.0001), gender (female, 0.74 mm ± 0.61; male, 0.34 mm ± 0.51; <i>p</i> < 0.0001), bone quality (D1, 0.75 mm ± 0.62; D2, 0.43 mm ± 0.57; D3, 0.65 mm ± 0.60; <i>p</i> < 0.01), implant diameter (up to 4 mm, 0.49 mm ± 0.58; more than 4 mm, 1.21 mm ± 0.30; <i>p</i> < 0.0001), prosthetic connection type (direct to implant, 0.11 mm ± 0.58; transepithelial straight, 0.67 mm ± 0.57; transepithelial angled, 0.33 mm ± 0.25; <i>p</i> < 0001), implant model (internal conical, 0.17 mm ± 0.24; external conical, 0.48 mm ± 0.61; external cylindrical, 1.12 mm ± 0.32; <i>p</i> < 0.0001), prosthetic restoration type (full denture, 0.59 mm ± 0.59; partial denture, 0.50 mm ± 0.85; unitary crown, 0.08 mm ± 0.19; <i>p</i> < 0.05), and insertion torque (>35 N/cm, 0.53 mm ± 0.58; <35 N/cm, 1.04 mm ± 0.63; <i>p</i> < 0.01).At 2 years, marginal bone loss following prosthetic rehabilitation was shown to be influenced by multiple factors. Correct implantological planning is of vital importance for successful rehabilitation.","['dental implant', 'marginal bone loss', 'multicentre study']"
Retinal thickness and vascular parameters using optical coherence tomography in Alzheimer's disease: a meta-analysis.,"Examining the retinal tissue has the potential to provide a unique method and technique to quantify Alzheimer's disease-related changes in participants at various stages of the disease. In this meta-analysis, we aimed to investigate the association of various optical coherence tomography parameters with Alzheimer's disease and whether retinal measurements can be used to differentiate between Alzheimer's disease and control subjects. Scientific databases including Google Scholar, Web of Science, and PubMed were systematically searched for published articles that evaluated retinal nerve fiber layer thickness and retinal microvascular network in Alzheimer's disease and control subjects. Seventy-three studies (5850 participants, including 2249 Alzheimer's disease patients and 3601 controls) were included in this meta-analysis. Relative to controls, Alzheimer's disease patients had a significantly lower global retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.79, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: -1.03 to -0.54, P < 0.00001) as well as each quadrant being thinner in Alzheimer's disease versus controls. Regarding macular parameters, values measured by optical coherence tomography were significantly lower in Alzheimer's disease than controls for macular thickness (pooled SMD: -0.44, 95% CI: -0.67 to -0.20, P = 0.0003), foveal thickness (pooled SMD = -0.39, 95% CI: -0.58 to -0.19, P < 0.0001), ganglion cell inner plexiform layer (SMD = -1.26, 95% CI: -2.24 to -0.27, P = 0.01) and macular volume (pooled SMD = -0.41, 95% CI -0.76 to -0.07, P = 0.02). Analysis using optical coherence tomography angiography parameters revealed mixed results between Alzheimer's disease and controls. Superficial vessel density (pooled SMD = -0.42, 95% CI: -0.68 to -0.17, P = 0.0001) and deep vessel density (pooled SMD = -0.46, 95% CI: -0.75 to -0.18, P = 0.001) were found to be thinner in Alzheimer's disease patients whereas the foveal avascular zone (SMD = 0.84, 95% CI: 0.17-1.51, P = 0.01) was larger in controls.

Association Between Body Mass Index and Intracranial Aneurysm Rupture: A Multicenter Retrospective Study.,"<b>Background and Aims:</b> It has recently emerged the concept of ""obesity paradox,"" a term used to describe an inverse association between obesity and clinical outcomes in cardiovascular diseases and stroke. The purpose of this study was to investigate the association between body mass index (BMI) and the risk of intracranial aneurysm rupture. <b>Methods:</b> In this study, we conducted a retrospective analysis of a prospectively maintained database of patients with intracranial aneurysms from 21 medical centers in China. A total of 3,965 patients with 4,632 saccular intracranial aneurysms were enrolled. Patients were separated into unruptured (<i>n</i> = 1,977) and ruptured groups (<i>n</i> = 1,988). Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between BMI and intracranial aneurysm rupture. <b>Results:</b> Compared to the patients with normal BMI (18.5 to < 24.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), the odds of intracranial aneurysm rupture were significantly lower in patients with BMI 24.0 to < 28.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (OR = 0.745, 95% CI = 0.638-0.868, <i>P</i> = 0.000) and patients with BMI ≥ 28.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (OR = 0.628, 95% CI = 0.443-0.890, <i>P</i> = 0.009). Low BMI (<18.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was not associated with intracranial aneurysm rupture (OR = 0.894, 95% CI = 0.483-1.657, <i>P</i> = 0.505). For males, both the BMI 24.0 to < 28.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (OR = 0.606, 95% CI = 0.469-0.784, <i>P</i> = 0.000) and the BMI ≥ 28.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (OR = 0.384, 95% CI = 0.224-0.658, <i>P</i> = 0.001) were associated with a lower rupture risk, whereas the inverse association was not observed in females. Both the BMI 24.0 to < 28.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (OR = 0.722 for aged 50-60y, 95% CI = 0.554-0.938, <i>P</i> = 0.015; OR = 0.737 for aged >60y, 95% CI = 0.586-0.928, <i>P</i> = 0.009) and the BMI ≥ 28.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (OR = 0.517 for aged 50-60y, 95% CI = 0.281-0.950, <i>P</i> = 0.0034; OR = 0.535 for aged >60y, 95% CI = 0.318-0.899, <i>P</i> = 0.0018) was associated with a lower rupture risk in patients aged ≥50 years, whereas the association was not significant in patients aged <50 years. <b>Conclusions:</b> Increased BMI is significantly and inversely associated with saccular intracranial aneurysm rupture in males and patients aged ≥50 years.","['body mass index', 'cerebrovascular disease', 'intracranial aneurysms', 'stroke', 'subarachnoid hemorrhage']"
An Investigation into the Impact of Pre-Adolescent Training on Canine Behavior.,"An online survey about puppy training was sent to members of the Center for Canine Behavior Studies and posted on our social media platforms. Six hundred forty-one (641) qualifying owners provided information on 1023 dogs. About half (48%) of the dogs involved in the study attended puppy training and the balance (52%) did not. The goal of the study was to find out whether puppy training at various ages (1-3 months, 4 months, 5-6 months) helped prevent behavior problems later in life (≥1 year). Attending training at 6 months of age or younger resulted in 0.71 the odds of developing aggressive behavior (95% CI: 0.53-0.97; <i>p</i> = 0.030), 0.64 the odds of having a compulsive behavior (95% CI: 0.45-0.92; <i>p</i> = 0.015), 0.60 the odds of exhibiting destructive behavior (95% CI: 0.37-0.96; <i>p</i> = 0.035), 0.68 the odds of excessive barking (95% CI: 0.47-0.99; <i>p</i> = 0.043), and 1.56 the odds of house soiling (95% CI: 1.08-2.27; <i>p</i> = 0.019). Ancillary findings about the entire study population were that dogs acquired at 12 weeks of age or younger were found to have 0.65 the odds of fear/anxiety (95% CI: 0.46-0.92; <i>p</i> = 0.016) and 0.50 the odds of exhibiting destructive behavior (95% CI: 0.31-0.79; <i>p</i> = 0.003). In addition, male dogs were found to have 0.68 the odds of developing aggressive behavior (95% CI: 0.53-0.88; <i>p</i> = 0.003), 0.66 the odds of developing compulsive behavior (95% CI: 0.49-0.88; <i>p</i> = 0.006), 0.37 the odds of mounting/humping (95% CI: 0.26-0.52; <i>p</i> < 0.001), and 1.53 the odds of rolling in repulsive materials (95% CI: 1.18-1.97; <i>p</i> = 0.001). Neutered dogs of either sex were found to have 3.10 the odds of fear/anxiety (95% CI: 2.05-4.72; <i>p</i> < 0.001), 1.97 the odds of escaping/running away (95% CI: 1.12-3.69; <i>p</i> = 0.025), 2.01 the odds of exhibiting coprophagia (95% CI 1.30-3.19; <i>p</i> = 0.002), and 1.72 the odds of rolling in repulsive materials (95% CI: 1.12-2.66; <i>p</i> = 0.014). The odds of problematic jumping deceased by 0.84 for each 1-year increase in age (95% CI: 0.80-0.88; <i>p</i> < 0.001).","['behavior problems', 'dogs', 'questionnaire', 'survey', 'training']"
Vasa Vasorum Restructuring in Human Atherosclerotic Plaque Vulnerability: A Clinical Optical Coherence Tomography Study.,"Previous studies have suggested that vasa vasorum (VV) is associated with plaque progression and vulnerability.The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between coronary neovascularization structures and plaque characteristics.We included 53 patients who underwent optical coherence tomography to observe the proximal left anterior descending coronary artery. Patients were classified into 5 groups according to lesion characteristics: normal; fibrous plaque (FP); fibroatheroma (FA); plaque rupture (PR); and fibrocalcific plaque (FC). We defined signal-poor tubuloluminal structures recognized in cross-sectional and longitudinal profiles located in adventitial layer as VV, and within plaque as intraplaque neovessels. Two types of longitudinal microvascular structure (external running and internal running) and a particular type of intraplaque neovessels (a coral tree pattern) were noted. All VV and intraplaque neovessels were manually segmented followed by quantification with Simpson method.Among the groups, there was significant difference (expressed as median [interquartile range (IQR)]) in VV volume (normal: 0.329 [IQR: 0.209 to 0.361] mm(3), FP: 0.433 [IQR: 0.297 to 0.706] mm(3), FA: 0.288 [IQR: 0.113 to 0.364] mm(3), PR: 0.160 [IQR: 0.141 to 0.193] mm(3), and FC: 0.106 [IQR: 0.053 to 0.165] mm(3); p = 0.003) and intraplaque neovessels volume (normal: 0.00 [IQR: 0.00 to 0.00] mm(3), FP: 0.00 [IQR: 0.00 to 0.00] mm(3), FA: 0.028 [IQR: 0.019 to 0.041] mm(3), PR: 0.035 [IQR: 0.026 to 0.042] mm(3), and FC: 0.010 [IQR: 0.005 to 0.014] mm(3); p < 0.001). Significant differences were observed in the prevalence of the internal running (normal: 0.0%, FP: 28.6%, FA: 40.0%, PR: 70.0%, and FC: 40.0%; p = 0.032) and the coral tree pattern (normal: 0.0%, FP: 7.1%, FA: 40.0%, PR: 80.0%, and FC: 10.0%; p < 0.01). The VV volume correlated with fibrous plaque volume (r = 0.71; p < 0.01).VV increase with fibrous plaque volume and intraplaque neovessels with particular structures are associated with plaque vulnerability. Imaging for microvasculature could become a new window for plaque vulnerability.","['optical coherence tomography', 'plaque progression', 'plaque rupture', 'vasa vasorum', 'vulnerable plaque']"
"Effects of Statin Dose, Class, and Use Intensity on All-Cause Mortality in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.","to examine the impact of statins on reducing all-cause mortality among individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. This investigation explored the potential correlations between dosage, drug classification, and usage intensity with the observed outcomes.The research sample consisted of individuals aged 40 years or older diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Statin usage was determined as a frequent usage over a minimum of one month subsequent to type 2 diabetes diagnosis, where the average statin dose was ≥28 cumulative defined daily doses per year (cDDD-year). The analysis employed an inverse probability of treatment-weighted Cox hazard model, utilizing statin usage status as a time-varying variable, to evaluate the impact of statin use on all-cause mortality.The incidence of mortality was comparatively lower among the cohort of statin users (n = 50,804 (12.03%)), in contrast to nonusers (n = 118,765 (27.79%)). After adjustments, the hazard ratio (aHR; 95% confidence interval (CI)) for all-cause mortality was estimated to be 0.32 (0.31-0.33). Compared with nonusers, pitavastatin, rosuvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, fluvastatin, and lovastatin users demonstrated significant reductions in all-cause mortality (aHRs (95% CIs) = 0.06 (0.04-0.09), 0.28 (0.27-0.29), 0.29 (0.28-0.31), 0.31 (0.30-0.32), 0.31 (0.30-0.32), 0.36 (0.35-0.38), and 0.48 (0.47-0.50), respectively). In Q1, Q2, Q3, and Q4 of cDDD-year, our multivariate analysis demonstrated significant reductions in all-cause mortality (aHRs (95% CIs) = 0.51 (0.5-0.52), 0.36 (0.35-0.37), 0.24 (0.23-0.25), and 0.13 (0.13-0.14), respectively; <i>p</i> for trend <0.0001). Because it had the lowest aHR (0.32), 0.86 DDD of statin was considered optimal.In patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, consistent utilization of statins (≥28 cumulative defined daily doses per year) was shown to have a beneficial effect on all-cause mortality. Moreover, the risk of all-cause mortality decreased as the cumulative defined daily dose per year of statin increased.","['class of statin', 'dosedependent', 'mortality', 'statin', 'type 2 diabetes']"
Treatment zone decentration promotes retinal reshaping in Chinese myopic children wearing orthokeratology lenses.,"To investigate whether the treatment zone (TZ) decentration in orthokeratology (OK) lenses affects retinal expansion in Chinese children with myopia.Children aged 8 to 13 years (n = 30) were assessed over 13 months comprising 12 months of OK lens wear followed by discontinuation of lens wear for 1 month. Corneal topography was measured at 0, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 13 months. TZ decentration of the OK lens was calculated, and subjects were subdivided into a small decentration group (group S) and a large decentration group (group L) based on the median value of the weighted average decentration (d<sub>ave</sub> ). Central axial length (AL) and peripheral eye lengths (PELs) at the central retina, as well as 10°, 20° and 30° nasally and temporally were measured at 0 and 13 months under cycloplegia. Second-order polynomial (y = ax<sup>2</sup>  + bx + c) and linear fits (y = Kx + B) were applied to the peripheral relative eye length (PREL), and the coefficients 'a' and 'K' were used to describe the shape of the eye.Mean AL growth for one year was 0.28 ± 0.17 mm. In a multiple linear regression model, AL elongation was related to the baseline age (β = -0.41, p = 0.01) and the d<sub>ave</sub> (β = -0.37, p = 0.03) (R<sup>2</sup>  = 0.34, p = 0.002). When compared with smaller d<sub>ave</sub> (0.45 ± 0.15 mm), a larger d<sub>ave</sub> (0.89 ± 0.17 mm) was associated with slower ocular growth (central: 0.20 ± 0.13 mm vs. 0.35 ± 0.17 mm, p = 0.009; 10° nasal: 0.26 ± 0.18 mm vs. 0.45 ± 0.21 mm, p = 0.02; 10° temporal: 0.17 ± 0.14 mm vs. 0.32 ± 0.19 mm, p = 0.02) and more oblate retina shape ('a': -0.13 ± 0.02 vs. -0.14 ± 0.02, p = 0.02; K<sub>nasal</sub> : 0.35 ± 0.11 vs. 0.39 ± 0.09, p = 0.02; K<sub>temporal</sub> : -0.42 ± 0.08 vs. -0.46 ± 0.08, p = 0.004).Greater TZ decentration with the use of OK lenses was associated with slower axial growth and a more oblate retinal shape. TZ decentration caused local defocusing changes, which may inhibit myopic progression. These findings may have important implications for improving optical designs for myopia control.","['axial length', 'decentration', 'myopia', 'orthokeratology', 'retinal shape']"
Comparison of ocular parameters of two biometric measurement devices in highly myopic eyes.,"To compare the differences and agreement of ocular biometric parameters in highly myopic eyes obtained by optical biometric measurement instruments, the OA-2000 and IOLMaster 500.Totally, 90 patients (90 eyes) were included. They were divided into high myopia group and control group. Ocular parameters, including axial length (AL), mean keratometry (Km), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and white to white (WTW), were obtained from the OA-2000 and IOLMaster 500.For the control group, we applied Bland-Altman graphs to assess the 95% limits of agreement (LoA) for most parameters including AL, ACD, Km, and WTW (-0.24 to 0.29 mm, -0.22 to 0.45 mm, -0.39 to 0.31 D, and -0.90 to 0.86 mm, respectively). In high myopia patients, AL, ACD, Km values had wider 95% LoA (-0.34 to 0.32 mm, -0.36 to 0.34 mm, -0.57 to 0.47 D, respectively), except WTW (-0.80 to 0.68 mm). Differences were not statistically significant between these two instruments (<i>P</i>>0.05).Most parameters obtained by the OA-2000 and IOLMaster 500 are comparable, including the AL, ACD, and K values. Among them, the agreement of the high myopia patients is poor compared to the patients without high myopia.","['agreement', 'difference', 'high myopia', 'optical biometric measurement']"
Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol and Alzheimer's Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"<b>Objective:</b> To assess the association between low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). <b>Methods:</b> Embase, Pubmed, and Web of Science were searched until June 2019. Standard mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) was estimated using random-effects models. <b>Results:</b> Our meta-analysis of 26 studies revealed higher levels of LDL-c in AD than that of non-dementia controls (SMD = 0.35, 95% CI 0.12-0.58, <i>p</i> < 0.01). The meta-regression analysis on confounders showed that age (<i>p</i> < 0.01, Adj <i>R</i>-squared = 92.41%) and cardiovascular disease (<i>p</i> = 0.01, Adj <i>R</i>-squared = 85.21%), but not the body mass index, education, smoking, hypertension and diabetes mellitus, exerted an impact on the relationship between LDL-c and risk of ICH. Further subgroup analysis of age showed LDL-c levels in AD patients aged 60-70 were higher than that of non-dementia (60 ≤ age < 70: SMD = 0.80, 95% CI 0.23-1.37, <i>p</i> < 0.01); but no association between the SMD of AD in LDL-c and age over 70 was noted across the studies (70 ≤ age < 77: SMD = -0.02, 95% CI -0.39~0.34, <i>p</i> = 9.0; 77 ≤ age < 80: SMD = 0.15, 95% CI -0.17~0.47, <i>p</i> = 0.35; ≥80: SMD = 0.53, 95% CI -0.04~1.11, <i>p</i> = 0.07). The concentrations of LDL-c during the quintile interval of 3~4 were positively associated with AD (121 ≤ concentration < 137: SMD = 0.98, 95% CI 0.13~1.82, <i>p</i> = 0.02; ≥137: SMD = 0.62, 95% CI 0.18~1.06, <i>p</i> < 0.01); whereas there was no correlation between AD and LDL-c within the quintile interval of 1~2 (103.9 ≤ concentration < 112: SMD = 0.08, 95% CI -0.20~0.35, <i>p</i> = 0.59; 112 ≤ concentration < 121: SMD = -0.26, 95% CI -0.58~0.06, <i>p</i> = 0.11). <b>Conclusions:</b> Elevated concentration of LDL-c (>121 mg/dl) may be a potential risk factor for AD. This association is strong in patients aged 60-70 years, but vanishes with advancing age.","['Alzheimers disease', 'LDLc', 'association', 'metaanalysis', 'risk factor']"
Complications after Anterior Temporal Lobectomy for Medically Intractable Epilepsy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The efficacy of surgery in the management of patients with longstanding temporal lobe epilepsy has been established. Anterior temporal lobectomy (ATL) is the most frequently implemented procedure. However, there is an obvious need to assess its perioperative safety.We conducted a meta-analysis to estimate the postoperative mortality (Q1) and morbidity (Q2) associated with ATL for medically intractable epilepsy. In addition, we tried to identify the most frequent complications after ATL and assess their relative frequency (Q3) in children and adults.Fixed- and random-effects model meta-analysis was conducted to assess the proportion estimate for each outcome individually.The postoperative mortality and cumulative morbidity were estimated to be as high as 0.01 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.02) and 0.17 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.24), respectively. Psychiatric disorders were the most common postoperative complications after ATL, with an estimated frequency as high as 0.07 (95% CI: 0.04, 0.10), followed by visual field defects (0.06; 0.03, 0.11), and cognitive disorders (0.05; 0.02, 0.10). Less frequent complications included hemiparesis and language disorders (0.03; 0.01, 0.06), infections (0.03; 0.02, 0.04), hemorrhage (0.02; 0.01, 0.05), cranial nerve deficits (0.03; 0.02, 0.05), extra-axial fluid collections (0.02; 0.01, 0.03), and medical complications (0.02; 0.01, 0.03).Even though the mortality after ATL is minimal, the overall morbidity cannot be ignored. Psychiatric disturbances, visual field defects, and cognitive disorders are the most common postoperative complications, and should be considered during the preoperative planning and consultation.","['Anterior temporal lobectomy', 'Complications', 'Intractable epilepsy', 'Medically refractory epilepsy', 'Morbidity', 'Mortality']"
Osteoarthritis of the Distal Interphalangeal and First Carpometacarpal Joints is Associated with High Bone Mass in Women and Small Bone Size and Low Lean Mass in Men.,"To determine if primary hand osteoarthritis (OA) is associated with abnormal bone and anthropometric traits.We used DXA to measure total body bone mineral density (BMD), femoral neck width (bone size) and total body lean and fat mass in 39 subjects with hand OA (primary DIP and/or CMC I) and 164 controls. Data are presented as mean Z-scores or Odds Ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals.Women with hand OA had (compared to controls) higher BMD (0.5(0.1,0.9)) but similar bone size (-0.3(-0.8,0.2)), lean mass (0.3(-0.3,0.9)), fat mass (-0.1(-0.6,0.5)) and BMI (0.0(-0.6,0.6)). Men with hand OA had (compared to controls) similar BMD (-0.1(-0.7,0.6)), smaller bone size (-0.5(-1.1,-0.01)), lower lean mass (-0.6(-1.1,-0.04)), and similar fat mass (-0.2(-0.7,0.4)) and BMI -0.1(-0.6,0.6). In women, each SD higher BMD was associated with an OR of 1.8 (1.03, 3.3) for having hand OA. In men each SD smaller bone size was associated with an OR of 1.8 (1.02, 3.1) and each SD lower proportion of lean body mass with an OR of 1.9 (1.1, 3.3) for having hand OA.Women with primary DIP finger joint and/or CMC I joint OA have a phenotype with higher BMD while men with the disease have a smaller bone size and lower lean body mass.","['Anthropometry', 'BMD', 'BMI', 'CMC I', 'DIP', 'bone mineral density', 'bone size', 'carpometacarpal I joint', 'distal inter phalangeal joints', 'fingers', 'osteoarthritis']"
Association of Body Composition with Pulmonary Function in Ningxia: The China Northwest Cohort.,"In recent decades, obesity has become an epidemic worldwide and is a risk factor for many chronic diseases. Lung function is also a predictor of various chronic diseases. However, research results on the association between obesity and lung function are inconsistent and few studies have evaluated the association between central obesity indicators and lung function. Therefore, this study explored the correlation between central obesity and lung function.This study is a cross-sectional study. The basic participant characteristics were collected by questionnaire. A tape measure was used to measure waist circumference (WC) and hip circumference (HC). Body fat percentage was measured using an InBody370. Lung function parameters were measured using a digital spirometer connected to a computer (Chestgraph HI-101). R (R4.0.5) software was used for data analysis. A generalized linear model was used to analyze the association between obesity and lung function.This study found that body mass index (BMI) adjusted for WC was negatively correlated with forced vital capacity (FVC) (β=-0.05 [-0.06, -0.03] in men, β=-0.05 [-0.07, -0.04] in women) and forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)(β=-0.02 [-0.03, -0.00] in men, β=-0.03 [-0.04, -0.02] in women). Body fat percentage was negatively correlated with FVC (β=-0.01 [-0.01, -0.01] in men, β=-0.01 [-0.01, -0.00] in women).Central obesity and combined central and general obesity were more strongly positively correlated with lung function. WC-adjusted BMI was negatively correlated with lung function. Body fat percentage was negatively correlated with lung function.","['body mass index', 'central obesity', 'lung function', 'waist circumference']"
Association Between Serum Iron Status and Muscle Mass in Adults: Results From NHANES 2015-2018.,"Iron deficiency or overload may contribute to complications associated with diseases, but the link between iron status and skeletal muscle disorder is poorly understood. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum iron status, reflected by serum ferritin concentration, and muscle mass in U.S. adults.We utilized data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2015-2018 for analysis. Data on serum ferritin, appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), body mass index (BMI) and confounding factors were extracted and analyzed. Multivariate linear regression analyses and smooth curve fittings were employed to investigate the association between serum ferritin and muscle mass. Subgroup analysis based on iron status, age, gender and race were performed.A total of 2,078 participants were included, and divided into iron deficiency (<i>n</i> = 225), normal iron status (<i>n</i> = 1,366), and iron overload (<i>n</i> = 487) groups. Participants with iron overload had significantly lower ASM and appendicular skeletal muscle index (ASMI) (ASM: 19.329 ± 4.879, ASMI: 0.709 ± 0.138) compared to those with iron deficiency (ASM: 22.660 ± 6.789, ASMI: 0.803 ± 0.206) and normal iron status (ASM: 22.235 ± 6.167, ASMI: 0.807 ± 0.201). The serum ferritin was negatively linked with muscle mass after adjusting for potential confounders (β = -0.0001, 95% CI: -0.0001, -0.0000). When stratified by iron status, the trend test between them remained significant (P for trend: 0.008). Furthermore, subgroup analysis identified a stronger association in men (β = -0.0001, 95% CI: -0.0002, -0.0001), age ≥ 40 years (β = -0.0001, 95% CI: -0.0002, -0.0000), non-Hispanic black (β = -0.0002, 95% CI: -0.0003, -0.0001) and other races (β = -0.0002, 95% CI: -0.0003, -0.0000).Our study revealed an inverse relationship between serum iron status and muscle mass in adults. This finding improves our understanding of the impact of serum iron status on muscle mass, and sheds new light on the prevention and treatment of muscle loss.","['NHANES', 'ferritin', 'iron', 'sarcopenia', 'skeletal muscle']"
Retrospective analysis on the agreement between skin prick test and serum food specific IgE antibody results in adults with suspected food allergy.,"Food allergy is a common clinical problem in adults. Given logistical barriers to conducting food challenges, the use of skin prick test (SPT) and specific IgE (sIgE) are important in establishing the diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to investigate the agreement of SPT and sIgE results in adults presenting to an allergy clinic with suspected food allergy.Retrospective analysis of medical records at the University of Alberta Allergy Clinic between September 2013 and May 2015 was performed. Demographic, medical history as well as SPT and specific IgE results were recorded. Agreement of SPT and sIgE for individual food allergens was analyzed by Kappa statistics.Data from 260 patients was collected. The population was predominantly female, often having other atopic diseases. Very few food challenges were performed; IgE mediated food allergy was diagnosed in a minority (29.6 %) of cases. Kappa values which reached statistical significance were moderate for peanut ĸ = 0.535 (p = 0.0002, CI 0.364-0.707), walnut ĸ = 0.408 (p = 0.001 CI 0.159-0.657), pecan ĸ = 0.530 (p = 0.001 CI 0.211-0.848), and lobster ĸ = 0.543 (p = 0.004 CI 0.197-0.889), substantial for pistachio ĸ = 0.657 (p = 0.023 CI 0.224-1.000), codfish ĸ = 0.770 (p = 0.0002 CI 0.558-0.983), shrimp ĸ = 0.627 (p = 0.0006 CI 0.383-0.871) and egg white ĸ = 0.625 (p = 0.002 CI 0.293-0.957), almost perfect for cashew ĸ = 0.894 (p = 0.0008 CI 0.693-1.000) and salmon ĸ = 0.874 (p = 0.004 CI 0.705-1.000).The agreement between SPT and sIgE results on adults being evaluated for food allergy is at least moderate or better for peanut, walnut, pecan, pistachio, cashew, lobster, shrimp, codfish, salmon and egg white. This should be reassuring for patients who have contraindications or restricted access to either test as the results for the above allergens will likely agree. These findings may suggest that these tests could possibly be interchangeable in adults being evaluated for suspected food allergy and will aid primary care physicians in the triage of patients requiring allergist care.","['Adult', 'Agreement', 'Food allergy', 'Skin prick test', 'Specific IgE']"
Changing trends in otorhinolaryngological diseases at a non-government clinic in Jaipur.,"Otorhinolaryngological (ENT) diseases are major health problem in India but the trends in occurrence of various disorders in clinical practice have not been well studied. To assess the types of such diseases and to determine changing trends in their incidence we performed this study.The study was done at a non-government ENT center at Jaipur. From 1975 to 2005, >125000 patients of different diseases were evaluated here. The study includes randomly selected patients (n = 11454) from years 1980 to 2000 at an interval of 5 years to evaluate disease trends. Significance of trends was evaluated using least squares regression.In the years 1980, 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000 mean age of patients was 26.60 ± 17.81 (range 0.16 to 85), 27.07 ± 16.91 (0.08 to 90), 28.30 ± 17.73 (0.25 to 90), 28.79 ± 17.8 (0.25 to 90) and 28.74 ± 17.81 (0.25 to 85) years respectively. 51 types of ENT diseases were observed of which 19 contributed to 76.8% (8807) patients and analysis was restricted to them. Chronic suppurative otitis media (2203, 19.2%), otitis externa (859, 7.5%), deviated nasal septum with nasal obstruction (717, 6.3%) and chronic tonsillitis (695, 6.1%) were the most common, followed by ear wax (569, 4.9%), sensorineural hearing loss (545, 4.7%), chronic rhinosinusitis (428, 3.7%) and epistaxis (320, 2.8%). There was increasing trend for stomatitis (b = 0.0014), deviated nasal septum (b = 0.0290), allergic rhinitis (b = 0.0023), epistaxis (b = 0.0002), acute tonsillitis (b = 0.0003), hoarseness (b = 0.0017), deaf mutism (b = 0.0005), sensorineural hearing loss (b = 0.0038), tinnitus (b = 0.0006) and ear wax (b = 0.0050). Declining trend was observed for chronic rhinosinusitis (b = -0.0155), otitis externa (b = -0.0063), chronic suppurative otitis media (b = -0.0001), acute otitis media ( = -0.0007), secretory otitis media (b = -0.0013), otosclerosis (b = -0.0007), vertigo (b = -0.0007), neck swelling (b = -0.0005) and chronic tonsillitis (b = -0.0194).This study from an Indian urban ENT center shows a significantly increasing trend in chronic and degenerative ear diseases and decline in infection related diseases.","['ENT disorders', 'Least squares regression principle', 'Otorhinolaryngological diseases', 'Trend analysis']"
Efficacy and safety of Gegen Qinlian decoction in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials.,"The study aims to systematically assess the efficacy and safety of Gegen Qinlian decoction in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus.We systematically searched a total of nine databases from the time of creation to 20 March 2023. The quality of the literature was assessed using the risk of bias assessment tool in the Cochrane Handbook. RevMan 5. 3 and Stata 14.0 were applied to conduct meta-analysis.A total of 17 studies, encompassing 1,476 patients, were included in the study. Gegen Qinlian decoction combined with conventional treatment was found to significantly reduce FBG (MD = -0.69 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.84 to -0.55, p < 0.01; I<sup>2</sup> = 67%, p<0.01), 2hPG (MD = -0.97 mmol/L, 95% CI -1.13 to -0.81, p < 0.01; I<sup>2</sup> = 37%, p=0.09), HbA1c (MD = -0.65%, 95% CI -0.78 to -0.53, p < 0.01; I<sup>2</sup> = 71%, p<0.01), TC (MD = -0.51 mmol/L, 95% CI -0.62 to -0.41, p < 0.01; I<sup>2</sup> = 45%, p=0.09), TG (MD = -0.17mmol/L, 95% CI -0.29 to -0.05, p < 0.01; I<sup>2</sup> = 78%, p<0.01), LDL-C (MD = -0.38mmol/L, 95% CI -0.53 to -0.23, p < 0.01; I<sup>2</sup> = 87%, p<0.01), HOMA-IR (SMD = -1.43, 95% CI -2.32 to -0.54, p < 0.01; I<sup>2</sup> = 94%, p<0.01), and improved HDL-C (MD = 0.13 mmol/L, 95% CI 0.09-0.17, p < 0.01; I<sup>2</sup> = 30%, p=0.24). Only three studies explored the differences in efficacy between GQD alone and conventional treatment in improving glucose-lipid metabolism and insulin resistance, and some of the outcome indicators, such as 2hPG and HDL-C, were examined in only one study. Therefore, the effect of GQD alone on glucose-lipid metabolism and insulin resistance cannot be fully determined, and more high-quality studies are needed to verify it. Publication bias analysis revealed no bias in the included studies.Gegen Qinlian Decoction has certain efficacy and safety in enhancing glycolipid metabolism and alleviating insulin resistance, potentially serving as a complementary therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus. Rigorous, large-sample, multicenter RCTs are needed to verify this.https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42023413758, PROSPERO CRD42023413758.","['Gegen Qinlian decoction', 'adverse effect', 'metaanalysis', 'traditional Chinese medicine', 'type 2 diabetes mellitus']"
Transanal endoscopic microsurgery versus radical resection for early-stage rectal cancer: a systematic review and meta- analysis.,"In the treatment of early-stage rectal cancer, a growing number of studies have shown that transanal endoscopic microsurgery is one of the alternatives to radical surgery adhering to total mesorectal excision that can reduce the incidence of adverse events without compromising treatment outcomes. The purpose of this meta-analysis is to compare the safety and treatment effect of transanal endoscopic microsurgery and radical surgery adhering to total mesorectal excision to provide a basis for clinical treatment selections.We searched the literatures of four major databases, PubMed, Embase, Web of science, and Cochrane Library, without limitation of time. The literatures included randomized controlled studies and cohort studies comparing two surgical procedures of transanal endoscopic microsurgery and radical surgery adhering to total mesorectal excision. Treatment effectiveness and safety results of transanal endoscopic microsurgery and radical surgery were extracted from the included literatures and statistically analyzed using RevMan5.4 and stata17.Ultimately, 13 papers were included in the study including 5 randomized controlled studies and 8 cohort studies. The results of the meta-analysis showed that the treatment effect and safety of both transanal endoscopic microsurgery and radical surgery in distant metastasis (RR, 0.59 (0.34, 1.02), P > 0.05), overall recurrence (RR, 1.49 (0.96, 2.31), P > 0.05), disease-specific-survival (RR, 0.74 (0.09, 1.57), P > 0.05), dehiscence of the sutureline or anastomosis leakage (RR, 0.57 (0.30, 1.06), P > 0.05), postoperative bleeding (RR, 0.47 (0.22, 0.99), P > 0.05), and pneumonia (RR, 0.37, (0.10, 1.40), P > 0.05) were not significantly different. However, they differ significantly in perioperative mortality (RR, 0.26 (0.07, 0.93, P < 0.05)), local recurrence (RR, 2.51 (1.53, 4.21), P < 0.05),_overall survival_ (RR, 0.88 (0.74, 1.00), P < 0.05), disease-free-survival (RR, 1.08 (0.97, 1.19), P < 0.05), temporary stoma (RR, 0.05 (0.01, 0.20), P < 0.05), permanent stoma (RR, 0.16 (0.08, 0.33), P < 0.05), postoperative complications (RR, 0.35 (0.21, 0.59), P < 0.05), rectal pain (RR, 1.47 (1.11, 1.95), P < 0.05), operation time (RR, -97.14 (-115.81, -78.47), P < 0.05), blood loss (RR, -315.52 (-472.47, -158.57), P < 0.05), and time of hospitalization (RR, -8.82 (-10.38, -7.26), P < 0.05).Transanal endoscopic microsurgery seems to be one of the alternatives to radical surgery for early-stage rectal cancer, but more high-quality clinical studies are needed to provide a reliable basis.","['Earlystage rectal cancer', 'Radical surgery', 'Total mesorectal excision', 'Transanal endoscopic microsurgery']"
Impact of protocol-based physiotherapy on insulin sensitivity and peripheral glucose metabolism in critically ill patients.,"The impact of physiotherapy on insulin sensitivity and peripheral glucose metabolism in critically ill patients is not well understood.This pooled analysis investigates the impact of different physiotherapeutic strategies on insulin sensitivity in critically ill patients. We pooled data from two previous trials in adult patients with sequential organ failure assessment score (SOFA)≥ 9 within 72 h of intensive care unit (ICU) admission, who received hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic (HE) clamps. Patients were divided into three groups: standard physiotherapy (sPT, n = 22), protocol-based physiotherapy (pPT, n = 8), and pPT with added muscle activating measures (pPT+, n = 20). Insulin sensitivity index (ISI) was determined by HE clamp. Muscle metabolites lactate, pyruvate, and glycerol were measured in the M. vastus lateralis via microdialysis during the HE clamp. Histochemical visualization of glucose transporter-4 (GLUT4) translocation was performed in surgically extracted muscle biopsies. All data are reported as median (25th/75th percentile) (trial registry: ISRCTN77569430 and ISRCTN19392591/ethics approval: Charité-EA2/061/06 and Charité-EA2/041/10).Fifty critically ill patients (admission SOFA 13) showed markedly decreased ISIs on Day 17 (interquartile range) 0.029 (0.022/0.048) (mg/min/kg)/(mU/L) compared with healthy controls 0.103 (0.087/0.111), P < 0.001. ISI correlated with muscle strength measured by medical research council (MRC) score at first awakening (r = 0.383, P = 0.026) and at ICU discharge (r = 0.503, P = 0.002). Different physiotherapeutic strategies showed no effect on the ISI [sPT 0.029 (0.019/0.053) (mg/min/kg)/(mU/L) vs. pPT 0.026 (0.023/0.041) (mg/min/kg)/(mU/L) vs. pPT+ 0.029 (0.023/0.042) (mg/min/kg)/(mU/L); P = 0.919]. Regardless of the physiotherapeutic strategy metabolic flexibility was reduced. Relative change of lactate/pyruvate ratio during HE clamp is as follows: sPT 0.09 (-0.13/0.27) vs. pPT 0.07 (-0.16/0.31) vs. pPT+ -0.06 (-0.19/0.16), P = 0.729, and relative change of glycerol concentration: sPT -0.39 (-0.8/-0.12) vs. pPT -0.21 (-0.33/0.07) vs. pPT+ -0.21 (-0.44/-0.03), P = 0.257. The majority of ICU patients showed abnormal localization of GLUT4 with membranous GLUT4 distribution in 37.5% (3 of 8) of ICU patients receiving sPT, in 42.9% (3 of 7) of ICU patients receiving pPT, and in 53.8% (7 of 13) of ICU patients receiving pPT+ (no statistical testing possible).Our data suggest that a higher duration of muscle activating measures had no impact on insulin sensitivity or metabolic flexibility in critically ill patients with sepsis-related multiple organ failure.","['Critical illness', 'Glucose clamp technique', 'Microdialysis', 'Multiple organ failure', 'Protocolbased physiotherapy', 'Stress hyperglycaemia']"
Obesity-related genetic determinants of stroke.,"As obesity, circulating lipids and other vascular/metabolic factors influence the risk of stroke, we examined if genetic variants associated with these conditions are related to risk of stroke using a case-control study in Galicia, Spain. A selection of 200 single-nucleotide polymorphisms previously found to be related to obesity, body mass index, circulating lipids, type 2 diabetes, heart failure, obesity-related cancer and cerebral infarction were genotyped in 465 patients diagnosed with stroke and 480 population-based controls. An unsupervised Lasso regression procedure was carried out for single-nucleotide polymorphism selection based on their potential effect on stroke according to obesity. Selected genotypes were further analysed through multivariate logistic regression to study their association with risk of stroke. Using unsupervised selection procedures, nine single-nucleotide polymorphisms were found to be related to risk of stroke overall and after stratification by obesity. From these, rs10761731, rs2479409 and rs6511720 in obese subjects [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 0.61 (0.39-0.95) (<i>P</i> = 0.027); 0.54 (0.35-0.84) (<i>P</i> = 0.006) and 0.42 (0.22-0.80) (<i>P</i> = 0.0075), respectively], and rs865686 in non-obese subjects [odds ratio (95% confidence interval) = 0.67 (0.48-0.94) (<i>P</i> = 0.019)], were independently associated with risk of stroke after multivariate logistic regression procedures. The associations between the three single-nucleotide polymorphisms found to be associated with stroke risk in obese subjects were more pronounced among females; for rs10761731, odds ratios among obese males and females were 1.07 (0.58-1.97) (<i>P</i> = 0.84), and 0.31 (0.14-0.69) (<i>P</i> = 0.0018), respectively; for rs2479409, odd ratios were 0.66 (0.34-1.27) (<i>P</i> = 0.21), and 0.49 (0.24-0.99) (<i>P</i> = 0.04), for obese males and females, respectively; the stroke-rs6511720 association was also slightly more pronounced among obese females, odds ratios were 0.33 (0.13-0.87) (<i>P</i> = 0.022), and 0.28 (0.09-0.85) (<i>P</i> = 0.02) for obese males and females, respectively. The rs865686-stroke association was more pronounced among non-obese males [odds ratios = 0.61 (0.39-0.96) (<i>P</i> = 0.029) and 0.72 (0.42-1.22) (<i>P</i> = 0.21), for non-obese males and females, respectively]. A combined genetic score of variants rs10761731, rs2479409 and rs6511720 was highly predictive of stroke risk among obese subjects (<i>P</i> = 2.04 × 10<sup>-5</sup>), particularly among females (<i>P</i> = 4.28 × 10<sup>-6</sup>). In summary, single-nucleotide polymorphisms rs1076173, rs2479409 and rs6511720 were found to independently increase the risk of stroke in obese subjects after adjustment for established risk factors. A combined score with the three genomic variants was an independent predictor of risk of stroke among obese subjects in our population.","['genomic cerebrovascular predictors', 'obesityrelated genetic markers', 'singlenucleotide polymorphisms', 'stroke risk']"
Frailty and medication adherence among older adult patients with hypertension: a moderated mediation model.,"Medication adherence has a critical impact on the well-being of older adult patients with hypertension. As such, the current study aimed to investigate the mediating role of health literacy between frailty and medication adherence and the moderating role of educational level.This cross-sectional study included patients admitted to the geriatric unit of a hospital. Participants were interviewed using the four-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale, the Frailty Phenotype Scale, and the Health Literacy Management Scale. Spearman's correlation coefficients were used to assess the association between variables. Mediation and moderated mediation analyses were performed using Process version 4.1 via Model 4 and 14, respectively.Data from 388 participants were analyzed. The median (IQR [P<sub>25</sub>-P<sub>75</sub>]) score for medication adherence was 4.00 (2.00-4.00). Results revealed that after controlling for age, sex, hypertension complication(s) and body mass index, frailty significantly contributed to medication adherence (β<sub>total</sub> -0.236 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.333 to -0.140]). Medication adherence was influenced by frailty (β<sub>direct</sub> -0.192 [95% CI -0.284 to -0.099]) both directly and indirectly through health literacy (β<sub>indirect</sub> -0.044 [95% CI -0.077 to -0.014]). Educational level moderated the pathway mediated by health literacy; more specifically, the conditional indirect effect between frailty and medication adherence was significant among older adult hypertensive patients with low, intermediate, and high educational levels (effect -0.052 [95% CI -0.092 to -0.106]; effect -0.041 [95% CI -0.071 to -0.012]; effect -0.026 [95% CI -0.051 to -0.006]). The relationship between frailty and medication adherence in older adult patients with hypertension was found to have mediating and moderating effects.A moderated mediation model was proposed to investigate the effect of frailty on medication adherence. It was effective in strengthening medication adherence by improving health literacy and reducing frailty. More attention needs to be devoted to older adult patients with hypertension and low educational levels.","['educational level', 'frailty', 'health literacy', 'hypertension', 'medication adherence', 'older adult patients']"
C15:0 and C17:0 partially mediate the association of milk &dairy products with bladder cancer risk.,"The relationship between saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and bladder cancer (BC) risk has been conflicting. Our aim was to investigate the relationship between erythrocyte membrane SFAs and BC risk. Total 404 participants were enrolled in the study (including 112 cases and 292 controls). The validated food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) was utilized to assess the food intake. The constitutive composition of fatty acids in erythrocyte membrane was measured by gas chromatography (GC). After adjustment for BC risk factors, SFAs had no significant association with BC risk. However, C18:0 was positively linked with BC risk with an OR (95% CI) of 2.99 (1.37 ∼6.53). In contrast, very long chain saturated fatty acids (VLCSFAs), especially C24:0, were negatively related with BC risk [OR (95% CIs): 0.28 (0.12, 0.65) for VLCSFAs and 0.33 (0.15, 0.75) for C24:0]. Higher total odd-SFAs, C15:0 and C17:0 were associated with a lower risk of BC [OR (95% CIs): 0.18 (0.076 ∼0.44), 0.18 (0.068 ∼0.47), 0.34 (0.14 ∼0.81), respectively]. After subgroup analysis, the protective effects C15:0 and C17:0 were still remained. ROC analysis displayed that the combination of C15:0 and C17:0 indexes increased the accurate predictive rate of BC risk. Further mediation effect analysis showed that C15:0 and C17:0 could be used as partial mediation effectors for milk and dairy products and bladder carcinogenesis. In conclusion, the combination of odd-SFAs (C15:0 and C17:0) in the erythrocyte membrane could serve as a reliable mediator and predictor, indicating a relationship between high intake of milk and dairy products and a lower risk of BC.","['Bladder cancer', 'Erythrocyte membrane', 'Milk  dairy products', 'Saturated fatty acids']"
Moment-to-moment interaction between affectivity and coping behaviours in bipolar disorder and the role of cognitive appraisals.,"Individuals with bipolar disorder respond to affective symptoms with a range of coping behaviours, which may further maintain the symptoms.To examine moment-to-moment dynamics between affective states and coping behaviours, and to evaluate the role of cognitive appraisals of internal states as moderators.Forty-six individuals with bipolar disorder completed a clinical interview and an experience sampling assessment over 6 days. Time-lagged analyses were conducted by multilevel regression modelling.A total of 1807 momentary entries were analysed. Negative affect predicted an increase in rumination at the subsequent time point (β = 0.21, s.e. = 0.08, P = 0.009, 95% CI 0.05-0.36), and vice versa (β = 0.03, s.e. = 0.01, P = 0.009, 95% CI 0.01-0.05). Positive affect predicted an increase in adaptive coping (β = 0.26, s.e. = 0.11, P = 0.018, 95% CI 0.04-0.47), and vice versa (β = 0.02, s.e. = 0.01, P = 0.019, 95% CI 0.00-0.03). Positive affect also predicted a decrease in rumination (β = -0.15, s.e. = 0.06, P = 0.014, 95% CI -0.26 to -0.03), and vice versa (β = -0.03, s.e. = 0.01, P = 0.016, 95% CI -0.06 to -0.01). Extreme cognitive appraisals predicted stronger associations between affective states and coping behaviours.Feedback loops between affective states and coping behaviours were revealed in the daily life of individuals with bipolar disorder, which were moderated by extreme cognitive appraisals.None.","['Bipolar disorder', 'affect', 'cognitive appraisals', 'coping', 'experience sampling']"
Collateral consequences of the school-to-prison pipeline: Adolescent substance use and developmental risk.,"The adolescent health consequences of the school-to-prison pipeline remain underexplored. We test whether initiating components of the school-to-prison pipeline-suspensions, expulsions, and school policing-are associated with higher school-average levels of student substance use, depressed feelings, and developmental risk in the following year.We linked 2003-2014 data from the California Healthy Kids Survey and the Civil Rights Data Collection from over 4,800 schools and 4,950,000 students. With lagged multi-level models, we estimated relationships between the school prevalence of total discipline, out-of-school discipline, and police-involved discipline, and standardized school-average levels of 6 substance use measures and 8 measures of developmental risk, respectively.The prevalence of school discipline predicted subsequent school-mean substance use and developmental risk. A one-unit higher prevalence of total discipline predicted higher school levels (in standard deviations) of binge drinking alcohol (0.14, 95% CI: 0.11, 0.17), drinking alcohol (0.15, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.18), smoking tobacco (0.09, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.12), using cannabis (0.16, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.19), using other drugs (0.17, 95% CI: 0.14, 0.21), and violence/harassment (0.16, 95% CI: 0.12, 0.2). Total discipline predicted lower levels of reported community support (-0.07, 95% CI: -0.1, -0.05), feeling safe in school (-0.12, 95% CI: -0.16, -0.09), and school support (-0.16, 95% CI: -0.19, -0.12). Associations were greater in magnitude for more severe out-of-school discipline. Findings were inconsistent for police-involved discipline.Exclusionary school discipline and school policing-core elements of the school-to-prison pipeline-are previously unidentified population predictors of adolescent substance use and developmental risk.","['Mental health', 'Public health', 'School discipline', 'Schooltoprison pipeline', 'Substance use']"
Predictive factors of clinical success after adrenalectomy in primary aldosteronism: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Unilateral adrenalectomy is the mainstay treatment for unilateral primary aldosteronism (PA). This meta-analysis aimed to systematically analyse predictors of clinical success after unilateral adrenalectomy in PA.A search was performed using <i>PubMed/Medline</i>, <i>Scopus</i>, <i>Embase</i> and <i>Web of Science</i> from their inception to February 2022. Observational studies in adult PA patients which reported predictors of clinical success after unilateral adrenalectomy were included. A random-effects model was employed to pool the fully adjusted odds ratio (OR) or standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (95% CI).Thirty-two studies involving 5,601 patients were included. Females had a higher clinical success rate (OR 2.81; 95% CI 2.06-3.83). Older patients, patients with a longer duration of hypertension and those taking a higher number of antihypertensive medications had lower clinical success rates (OR 0.97; 95% CI 0.94-0.99, OR 0.92; 95% CI 0.88-0.96 and OR 0.44; 95% CI 0.29-0.67, respectively). Compared to non-clinical success cases, patients with clinical success had a lower body mass index (SMD -0.49 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 95% CI -0.58,-0.39), lower systolic (SMD -0.37 mmHg; 95% CI -0.56,-0.18) and diastolic blood pressure (SMD -0.19 mmHg; 95% CI -0.33,-0.06), lower serum potassium (SMD -0.16 mEq/L; 95% CI -0.28,-0.04), higher eGFR (SMD 0.51 mL/min/1.73m<sup>2</sup>; 95% CI 0.16,0.87), a lower incidence of dyslipidemia (OR 0.29; 95% CI 0.15-0.58) and a lower incidence of diabetes mellitus (OR 0.36; 95% CI 0.22-0.59).Multiple predictors of clinical success after unilateral adrenalectomy in PA were identified which can help improve the quality of care for PA patients. <b>Systematic Review Registration:</b> INPLASY, identifier 202240129.","['adrenalectomy', 'clinical success', 'metaanalysis', 'predictive factors', 'primary aldosteronism']"
Omega-3 fatty acid intake during pregnancy and risk of infant maltreatment: a nationwide birth cohort - the Japan Environment and Children's Study.,"Intake of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) has favorable effects, including reducing violent and aggressive behaviors, but its association with infant maltreatment is unknown. We therefore tested the hypothesis that maternal intake of omega-3 PUFAs is associated with a lower risk of infant maltreatment.Participants were 92 191 mothers involved in the ongoing Japan Environment and Children's Study. Omega-3 PUFA intake during pregnancy was measured using a food frequency questionnaire. Infant maltreatment was assessed using a self-reported questionnaire administered at 1 and 6 months postpartum.Analysis using the lowest quintile of intake as a reference revealed that the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for cases of 'hitting' decreased as quintiles increased, with values for the second to fifth quintiles of 0.93 (95% CI 0.77-1.13), 0.79 (95% CI 0.64-0.97), 0.78 (95% CI 0.64-0.96), and 0.72 (95% CI 0.59-0.89), respectively. Adjusted ORs (95% CIs) for 'shaking very hard' at 6 months were 0.87 (0.73-1.04), 0.81 (0.67-0.97), 0.73 (0.61-0.89), and 0.78 (0.65-0.94), respectively. Adjusted ORs for 'leaving alone at home' for the second to fifth quintiles were 0.92 (0.87-0.98), 0.91 (0.86-0.97), 0.94 (0.88-0.99), and 0.85 (0.80-0.90), respectively.Higher maternal intake of omega-3 PUFAs during pregnancy was associated with fewer cases of hitting and violent shaking and leaving the child alone at home, implying a lower risk of infant maltreatment. Our results indicate the potential applicability of omega-3 PUFAs in reducing infant maltreatment.","['Child abuse', 'child maltreatment', 'infant abuse and neglect', 'n3 polyunsaturated fatty acids', 'seafood']"
The effects and safety of activators of glucokinase versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects and safety of activators of glucokinase (GKAs) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 11 RCTs, including 2,429 participants, are enrolled in our study. According to different doses, we divided the studies into 3 groups: low-dose group, medium-dose group and high-dose group for subgroup analysis. There were decreases of HbA1c in all dose group (WMD = -0.27, 95%CI (-0.51~ -0.03), Z = 2.17, p = 0.03; WMD = -0.37, 95%CI (-0.58~ -0.16), Z = 3.41, p = 0.0006; WMD = -0.60, 95%CI (-0.86~ -0.33), Z = 4.43, p < 0.00001). Though the total risk of hypoglycemia is absolutely low, in the high-dose group higher hypoglycemia than the placebo can be observed (RR = 0.03, 95%CI (0.00~0.06), Z = 2.27, p = 0.02). In addition, the study found that the drug was less likely to have adverse reactions such as diarrhea, headache and dizziness, nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infection (RR = 0.76, 95%CI (0.36~1.60), Z = 0.73, p = 0.47; RR = 1.26, 95%CI (0.73~2.17), Z = 0.83, p = 0.41; RR = 0.71, 95%CI (0.41~1.22), Z = 1.25, p = 0.21; RR = 1.61, 95%CI (0.77~3.36), Z = 1.26, p = 0.21). It concludes that GKAs are relatively effective and safe in the treatment of patients with T2DM, but in consideration of the potential risk of hypoglycemia in the high-dose group, the low-dose and medium-dose group, in the clinical practice, can be an excellent choice.","['Activators of glucokinase', 'Metaanalysis', 'Type 2 diabetes mellitus']"
Relationship between core stability and dynamic balance in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between core stability and dynamic balance in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.A total of 100 females (mean age 59.9±7.5 years; range, 42 to 73 years) with postmenopausal osteoporosis between January 2016 and June 2016 were included in this study. All patients were evaluated for dynamic balance with the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT) and for core stability with trunk flexion, extension, and Side Bridge Test (SBT).There was a significant correlation between age and the reach directions of anterior (A), posteromedial (PM), and posterolateral (PL) of the right limb (p<0.001, p=0.009, p=0.012) and the reach directions of A and PM of the left limb (p<0.001, p=0.004). There was no correlation between the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip Bone Mineral Density (BMD) and the reach directions of SEBT (p>0.05). There was a significant correlation between the trunk flexion test results and the reach directions of A, PM, and PL of the right limb (p=0.005, p=0.001, p=0.002), (r=0.277, r=0.333, r=0.308) and the reach directions of A, PM, and PL of the left limb (p=0.008, p=0.016, p=0.005), (r=0.265, r=0.239, r=0.276). There was a significant correlation between the SBT results and the reach directions of A, PM, and PL of the right limb (p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.005), (r=0.423, r=0.366, r=0.281) and the reach directions of A, PM, and PL of the left limb (p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.001), (r=0.418, r=0.356, r=0.316). There was a significant correlation between the trunk extension test results and the reach directions of A, PM, and PL of the right limb (p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.006), (r=0.383, r=0.471, r=0.276) and the reach directions of A, PM, and PL of the left limb (p<0.001, p<0.001, p=0.003) (r=0.407, r=0.401, r=0.297).Our study results showed that age and core stability were associated with dynamic balance in women with postmenopausal osteoporosis.","['Balance', 'core stability', 'osteoporosis']"
"The impact of self-perceived limitations, stigma and sense of coherence on quality of life in multiple sclerosis patients: results of a cross-sectional study.","To examine the impact of perceived limitations, stigma and sense of coherence on quality of life in multiple sclerosis patients.Cross-sectional survey.Department of Neurology, University Medical Center Groningen, the Netherlands.Multiple sclerosis patients.World Health Organization Quality of Life - abbreviated version, Stigma Scale for Chronic Illness, Sense of Coherence Scale, background and disease-related questions.In total, 185 patients (61% response rate) participated in the study with moderate to severe limitations. Stigma was highly prevalent but low in severity. Patients with a higher sense of coherence experienced a lower level of limitations ( B = -0.063, P < 0.01) and less stigma (enacted stigma B = -0.030, P < 0.01; self-stigma B = -0.037, P < 0.01). Patients with a higher level of limitations experienced more stigma (enacted stigma B = 0.044, P < 0.05; self-stigma B = 0.063, P < 0.01).

Comparing Intra-articular Platelet-Rich Plasma With Hyaluronic Acid for the Treatment of Hip Osteoarthritis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Hip osteoarthritis (HOA), a prevalent condition among those aged 55 years and above, is a significant cause of joint pain and functional impairment and it contributes to the overall burden of chronic pain experienced by the elderly population. While platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and hyaluronic acid (HA) injections have emerged as innovative therapeutic approaches for managing osteoarthritis, their effectiveness in HOA remains a subject of contention. Therefore, the objective of this review was to assess the efficacy of PRP versus HA in terms of pain relief and functional outcomes for the management of HOA. We searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar databases from 2013 to 2023 to identify pertinent randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A total of seven trials (478 participants) were included. The selected studies underwent quality assessment using the updated Cochrane risk of bias tool. The pain and functional outcomes were examined using measures of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) pain scale, visual analog scale (VAS), and Harris hip score (HHS). In the meta-analysis, standard mean differences (SMDs) along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to estimate overall effect magnitudes for continuous outcomes were extracted. Statistical significance was determined using p-values below 0.05. At six months, the PRP group experienced a significantly lower standard mean WOMAC pain score (SMD = -0.38, CI = -0.64 - 0.13; p = 0.03). No significant differences in WOMAC pain scores were noted at one to two months (SMD = 0.09, CI = -0.24, 0.43; p = 0.59), and at 12 months (SMD = -0.85, CI = -1.81, 0.12; p = 0.09). Similarly, for VAS, patients on PRP showed a slight improvement in their VAS scores at six months (SMD = -0.50, CI = -0.89, -0.12; p < 0.01). However, no significant differences in VAS between the PRP groups and the HA groups were observed at one to two months (SMD = -0.22, CI = -0.49, 0.04; p = 0.10) and at 12 months (SMD = -0.22, CI: -0.63, 0.19; p = 0.29). In terms of hip dysfunction, there was no statistically significant standard mean difference in HHS between the PRP and HA groups at six months (SMD = 0.02, CI = -0.40, 0.44; p = 0.93), and at 12 months (SMD = -0.31, CI = -0.32, 0.22; p = 0.73). This review and meta-analysis provide insights into emerging treatments for HOA, especially considering that PRP shows potential benefits and safety for patients with HOA during mid-term follow-up in a 12-month period. Nevertheless, it is necessary to conduct research that includes high-quality designs and larger sample sizes to validate the comparative efficacy of these treatments.","['hip', 'intraarticular injection', 'osteoarthritis oa', 'plateletrich plasma prp', 'hyaluronic acid']"
Quality attributes of the developed banana flour: Effects of drying methods.,"The study aims to investigate the effects of different drying methods on the changes in functional properties, physicochemical composition, bioactive compounds, antioxidant activity, sensory attributes, and microstructural quality of the banana flours. Two local banana cultivars, Mehersagar and Sabri, were dried to produce flour using four distinct drying methods: freeze drying (FD), cabinet drying (CD), microwave oven drying (MOD), and forced air oven drying (FOD). The functional properties of the developed banana flours were observed where the findings were as water holding capacity (0.93 ± 0.06-2.74 ± 0.04 g water/g dry sample), oil absorption capacity (0.87 ± 0.06-2.22 ± 0.10 g oil/g dry sample), swelling capacity (4.62 ± 0.02-5.05 ± 0.03 g paste/g dry sample), bulk density (0.54 ± 0.04-0.81 ± 0.02 g/ml), tapped density (0.62 ± 0.04-0.93 ± 0.03 g/ml) and Carr's Index (9.38 ± 0.47-13.58 ± 0.43%). Freeze-dried Mehersagar cultivar's flour showed the leading functional properties with good flowability and cohesiveness. The physicochemical parameters of the flours also revealed significant differences (p < 0.05) in lightness (L*) (50.51 ± 1.49-72.21 ± 1.05), moisture content (3.96 ± 0.09-7.74 ± 0.13%), protein (2.72 ± 0.07-3.93 ± 0.06%), crude fat (0.11 ± 0.01-0.36 ± 0.04%), crude fiber (0.64 ± 0.03-1.22 ± 0.03%), carbohydrate (84.15 ± 0.24-88.26 ± 0.15%) and energy content (354.25 ± 0.57-370.02 ± 0.39 kcal/g). Total flavonoid content (21.44 ± 0.04-34.34 ± 0.03 mgQE/100g) and phenolic content (29.91 ± 0.01-71.46 ± 0.03 mgGAE/100g) was observed, while the highest retention of bioactive compounds was exhibited in Mehersagar cultivar's flour. In terms of appearance, fineness, taste, flavor, color, and overall acceptability, the dried banana flour of both the cultivars obtained from freeze-dried scored overall acceptability 8.04 ± 0.02 and 7.92 ± 0.17, respectively. The scanning electron microscopy analysis of the microstructure of flour granules from each sample revealed a diverse morphological configuration in particle size and shape. According to the findings of this study, the freeze-drying technology is superior to others, and the Mehersagar banana cultivar is more satisfactory in terms of quality characteristics. Moreover, the quality parameters of banana flour may facilitate the formulation of different flour-based gluten-free baked products and food supplements.","['Banana flour', 'Bioactive compounds', 'Drying methods', 'Functional property', 'Microstructures', 'Sensory attributes']"
Research on the influencing factors of fatigue and professional identity among CDC workers in China: an online cross-sectional study.,"This study aimed to investigate the status quo and the influencing factors of fatigue and professional identity among the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) workers in China during the pandemic.A cross-sectional design.CDC workers employed by the Liaoning CDC system were enrolled (administrative staffs were excluded).1020 CDC workers.Fatigue scores and professional identity scores.Postcompetency scores, respect scores, occupational stress scores, resilience scores and self-efficacy scores.The average scores of fatigue and professional identity were 8.23, 38.88, respectively. Factors including perceived public respect (<i>β</i>=-0.129, p<0.01), resilience (<i>β</i>=-0.104, p<0.05) and self-efficacy (<i>β</i>=-0.22, p<0.01) were negatively associated with fatigue.

Educational background (bachelor vs junior college or below) (<i>β</i>=-0.097, p<0.01), (master or above vs junior college or below) (<i>β</i>=-0.114, p<0.01), workplace (city vs district) (<i>β</i>=-0.114, p<0.01), fighting the COVID-19 on the front line (<i>β</i>=-0.047, p<0.05) and occupational stress (<i>β</i>=-0.105, p<0.01) were negatively associated with professional identity. Factors including postcompetency (<i>β</i>=0.362, p<0.01), perceived public respect (general vs low) (<i>β</i>=0.219, p<0.01), (high vs low) (<i>β</i>=0.288, p<0.01), resilience (<i>β</i>=0.097, p<0.05) and self-efficacy (<i>β</i>=0.113, p<0.01) were positively connected with professional identity.The fatigue among the CDC workers was at a higher level. The level of professional identity was high, and administrators should take measures to alleviate fatigue and maintain professional identity. In addition, methods aiming to attenuate occupational stress, and improve resilience and self-efficacy should be immediately put into action.","['depression  mood disorders', 'mental health', 'public health']"
Independent inter and intra-observer agreement of the Schizas's classification of degenerative lumbar stenosis: Comparison among three levels of surgical training.,"Lumbar spinal stenosis is a common age-related condition that affects the quality of life. Multiple classifications have been developed to quantify the severity of stenosis affecting comparison between studies and homogenous communication among surgeons and researchers. Even though this classification has not shown a direct clinical correlation, Schizas's classification appears to be a simple method to assess stenosis. Our objective was to evaluate the inter and intraobserver independent agreement of the Schizas's classification to assess stenosis severity. Additionally, we aimed to compare agreement among three levels of training in spine surgery.An independent inter and intra observer agreement was conducted among junior, senior orthopedic residents and attending spine surgeons. Ninety lumbar levels from 30 patients were evaluated by 16 observers. Weighted kappa agreement was used.Overall interobserver and intraobserver agreement was of 0.57 (95% CI=0.52-0.63) and 0.69 (0.55-0.79), respectively. Interobserver agreement according to level of training yielded values of 0.53 (0.46-0.60) for junior residents, 0.61 (0.54-0.67) for senior residents and 0.67 (0.59-0.74) for attendings. Intraobserver agreement was of 0.54 (0.48-0.60) for junior, 0.60 (0.55-0.66) for senior and 0.66 (0.60-0.72) for attendings.The Schizas's classification showed moderate interobserver and substantial intraobserver agreement. Among attending surgeons, substantial inter and intraobserver agreement was observed. The classification allowed acceptable communication among trained spine surgeons.","['Acuerdo independiente', 'Clasificación de Schizas', 'Estenosis espinal lumbar', 'Independent agreement', 'Lumbar spinal stenosis', 'Schizass classification']"

Incidence of endophthalmitis after phacoemulsification cataract surgery: a Meta-analysis.,"To evaluate the overall endophthalmitis incidence and the effectiveness of potential prophylaxis measures following phacoemulsification cataract surgery (PCS).The PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to April 30<sup>th</sup>, 2021. We included studies that reported on the incidence of endophthalmitis following PCS. The quality of the included studies was critically evaluated with the Newcastle-Ottawa quality assessment scale. The random effect or the fixed-effects model was used to evaluated the pooled incidence based on the heterogeneity. The publication bias was assessed by Egger's linear regression and Begg's rank correlation tests.A total of 39 studies containing 5 878 114 eyes were included and critically appraised in the Meta-analysis. For overall incidence of endophthalmitis after PCS, the Meta-analysis yielded a pooled estimate of 0.092% (95%CI: 0.083%-0.101%). The incidence appeared to decrease with time (before 2000: 0.097%, 95%CI: 0.060%-0.135%; 2000 to 2010: 0.089%, 95%CI: 0.076%-0.101%; after 2010: 0.063%, 95%CI: 0.050%-0.077%). Compared with typical povidone-iodine solution (0.178%, 95%CI: 0.071%-0.285%) and antibiotics subconjunctival injections (0.047%, 95%CI: 0.001%-0.095%), the use of intracameral antibiotics significantly reduced the incidence of endophthalmitis after PCS (0.045%, 95%CI: 0.034%-0.055%, RR: 7.942, 95%CI: 4.510-13.985).Due to the advancement of phacoemulsification technology and the widespread use of intracameral antibiotics, the incidence of endophthalmitis following PCS shows a decreasing trend over time. The use of intracameral antibiotics administration will significantly reduce the risk of endophthalmitis.","['Metaanalysis', 'antibiotics subconjunctival injections', 'endophthalmitis', 'intracameral antibiotics', 'phacoemulsification cataract surgery', 'typical povidoneiodine solution']"
The Test-Retest Variability of the COMPlog System in Participants with Induced Non-Normal Visual Acuity.,"The aim of this study was to determine and compare test-retest variability (TRV) of the computerised visual acuity (VA) COMPlog system on participants with normal vision and non-normal vision induced by bangerter foils (BFs).Twenty adult volunteers with VA of 0.100 logMAR or better in each eye and no eye conditions were included. Monocular VA data using the COMPlog system under five conditions-with plain Plano glasses (visually normal condition) and four pairs of Plano glasses with BF strengths of 0.6, 0.3, 0.2 and 0.1 (induced non-normal vision conditions)-were collected on two separate visits. To reduce bias, the eye tested and order of the BFs assessed were randomised. Data comparison was analysed using 2-factor ANOVA and paired t-tests and Bland Altman analysis to assess TRV.Mean VA score from the two visits was -0.072 ± 0.1 logMAR for Plano, 0.106 ± 0.1 logMAR for BF 0.6, 0.428 ± 0.1 logMAR for BF 0.3, 0.662 ± 0.09 logMAR for BF 0.2 and 0.850 ± 0.08 logMAR for BF 0.1. As BF density increased, VA score significantly worsened (p < 0.0001). Overall mean VA score from the first and second visit was 0.410 ± 0.4 logMAR and 0.379 ± 0.4 logMAR, respectively. This improvement was significant (p < 0.009). The 95% limits of agreement of the VA scores between testing conditions had a range of ±0.120 to ±0.220 logMAR.Increase in BF strength led to a worsened VA score. However, the COMPlog TRV under the visually normal and induced non-normal vision conditions were within a similar range (±0.120 to ±0.220 logMAR). VA significantly improved on the second visit, suggesting a possible learning effect, which could have a clinical impact.","['Bangerter foils', 'computerised COMPlog', 'computerised vision test', 'testretest variability']"
Does Tempo of Resistance Exercise Impact Training Volume?,"Volume and intensity of exercise are the basic components of training loads, having a direct impact on adaptive patterns. Exercise volume during resistance training has been conventionally evaluated as a total number of repetitions performed in each set, regardless of the time and speed of performing individual exercises. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of varied tempos i.e. regular (REG) 2/0/2/0, medium (MED) 5/0/3/0 and slow (SLO) 6/0/4/0 during resistance exercise on training volume, based on the total number of performed repetitions (REP<sub>sum1-5</sub>) and time under tension (TUT<sub>sum1-5</sub>). Significant differences in TUT (s) were found in particular sets for each tempo of 2/0/2/0, 5/0/3/0 and 6/0/4/0 (p < 0.001). The ANOVA also revealed substantial differences in the REP for individual sets (p < 0.001). Post-hoc analyses showed that TUT for each set and total TUTsum1-5 were significantly higher in the 5/0/3/0 and 6/0/4/0 tempos compared to 2/0/2/0 (p < 0.001). REP was significantly higher for the 2/0/2/0 tempo compared to 5/0/3/0 and 6/0/4/0 tempo in each set. Total REP<sub>sum1-5</sub>, TUT<sub>sum1-5</sub> between 5/0/3/0 and 6/0/4/0 tempos were not significantly different. The main finding of this study is that the movement tempo in strength training impacts training volume, both in terms of repetitions and total time under tension.","['resistance training', 'tempo', 'time under tension', 'volume']"
Large datasets from Electronic Health Records predict seizures after ischemic strokes: A Machine Learning approach.,"To develop an artificial intelligence, machine learning prediction model for estimating the risk of seizures 1 year and 5 years after ischemic stroke (IS) using a large dataset from Electronic Health Records.Seizures are frequent after ischemic strokes and are associated with increased mortality, poor functional outcomes, and lower quality of life. Separating patients at high risk of seizures from those at low risk of seizures is needed for treatment and clinical trial planning, but remains challenging. Machine learning (ML) is a potential approach to solve this paradigm.We identified patients (aged ≥18 years) with IS without a prior diagnosis of seizures from 2015 until inception (08/09/22) in the TriNetX Research Network, using the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) I63, excluding I63.6 (venous infarction). The outcome of interest was any ICD-10 diagnosis of seizures (G40/G41) at 1 year and 5 years following the index IS. We applied a conventional logistic regression and a Light Gradient Boosted Machine algorithm to predict the risk of seizures at 1 year and 5 years. The performance of the model was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC), the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), F1 statistic, model accuracy, balanced accuracy, precision, and recall, with and without anti-seizure medication use in the models.Our study cohort included 430,254 IS patients. Seizures were present in 18,502 (4.3%) and (5.3%) patients within 1 and 5 years after IS, respectively. At 1-year, the AUROC, AUPRC, F1 statistic, accuracy, balanced-accuracy, precision, and recall were respectively 0.7854 (standard error: 0.0038), 0.2426 (0.0048), 0.2299 (0.0034), 0.8236 (0.001), 0.7226 (0.0049), 0.1415 (0.0021), and 0.6122, (0.0095). Corresponding metrics at 5 years were 0.7607 (0.0031), 0.247 (0.0064), 0.2441 (0.0032), 0.8125 (0.0013), 0.7001 (0.0045), 0.155 (0.002) and 0.5745 (0.0095).Our findings suggest that ML models show good model performance for predicting seizures after IS.","['Ischemic stroke', 'TriNetX', 'machine learning', 'prediction', 'seizures']"
"Development, comparison, and validation of four intelligent, practical machine learning models for patients with prostate-specific antigen in the gray zone.","Machine learning prediction models based on LogisticRegression, XGBoost, GaussianNB, and LGBMClassifier for patients in the prostate-specific antigen gray zone are to be developed and compared, identifying valuable predictors. Predictive models are to be integrated into actual clinical decisions.Patient information was collected from December 01, 2014 to December 01, 2022 from the Department of Urology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University. Patients with a pathological diagnosis of prostate hyperplasia or prostate cancer (any PCa) and having a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level of 4-10 ng/mL before prostate puncture were included in the initial information collection. Eventually, 756 patients were selected. Age, total prostate-specific antigen (tPSA), free prostate-specific antigen (fPSA), fPSA/tPSA, prostate volume (PV), prostate-specific antigen density (PSAD), (fPSA/tPSA)/PSAD, and the prostate MRI results of these patients were recorded. After univariate and multivariate logistic analyses, statistically significant predictors were screened to build and compare machine learning models based on LogisticRegression, XGBoost, GaussianNB, and LGBMClassifier to determine more valuable predictors.Machine learning prediction models based on LogisticRegression, XGBoost, GaussianNB, and LGBMClassifier exhibit higher predictive power than individual metrics. The area under the curve (AUC) (95% CI), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and F1 score of the LogisticRegression machine learning prediction model were 0.932 (0.881-0.983), 0.792, 0.824, 0.919, 0.652, 0.920, and 0.728, respectively; of the XGBoost machine learning prediction model were 0.813 (0.723-0.904), 0.771, 0.800, 0.768, 0.737, 0.793 and 0.767, respectively; of the GaussianNB machine learning prediction model were 0.902 (0.843-0.962), 0.813, 0.875, 0.819, 0.600, 0.909, and 0.712, respectively; and of the LGBMClassifier machine learning prediction model were 0.886 (0.809-0.963), 0.833, 0.882, 0.806, 0.725, 0.911, and 0.796, respectively. The LogisticRegression machine learning prediction model has the highest AUC among all prediction models, and the difference between the AUC of the LogisticRegression prediction model and those of XGBoost, GaussianNB, and LGBMClassifier is statistically significant (p < 0.001).Machine learning prediction models based on LogisticRegression, XGBoost, GaussianNB, and LGBMClassifier algorithms exhibit superior predictability for patients in the PSA gray area, with the LogisticRegression model yielding the best prediction. The aforementioned predictive models can be used for actual clinical decision-making.​.","['GaussianNB', 'LGBMClassifier', 'LogisticRegression', 'XGBoost', 'gray area PSA', 'machine learning', 'prostate cancer']"
Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation With Oscillations in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis With Home Ventilation via Tracheostomy.,"Mechanical insufflation-exsufflation (MI-E) applied via tracheostomy tubes in patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) who are on home mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy is an effective procedure for respiratory secretion management. Nonetheless, tenacious secretions may remain and increase the risk of respiratory infections. The aim of this study was to determine whether adding oscillations to MI-E could reduce the rate of respiratory infections and the need for bronchoscopy to remove secretions in patients with ALS on home mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy.This was a 2-y, prospective, crossover study. Subjects were treated with conventional MI-E and MI-E with oscillations for 2 alternate 6-month periods. Data were collected on episodes of respiratory infections, hospital admission, and number of bronchoscopy procedures.In the 19 ALS subjects enrolled, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) number of acute respiratory infections per subject was 1.0 (0.5-2.0) in the MI-E period and 0.0 (0.0-2.0) in the MI-E plus oscillations period (<i>P</i> = .92). The median (IQR) number of hospital stays was 0.0 (0.0-1.0) in the MI-E period and 0.0 (0.0-1.0) in the MI-E plus oscillations period (<i>P</i> = .80). The median (IQR) number of bronchoscopies per subject was 0.0 (0.0-1.0) in MI-E period and 0.0 (0.0-0.5) in the MI-E plus oscillations period (<i>P</i> = .26). MI-E plus oscillations treatment had no impact on the risk of respiratory infections (odds ratio 3.71, 95% CI 0.81-16.84, <i>P</i> = .09) or the need for bronchoscopy (odds ratio 2.70, 95% CI 0.44-16.68, <i>P</i> = .29).Adding oscillations to MI-E therapy in subjects with ALS on home mechanical ventilation via tracheostomy did not decrease the risk of respiratory infections, hospital admission, or need for bronchoscopy.","['amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'longterm mechanical ventilation', 'mechanical insufflationexsufflation', 'respiratory failure', 'respiratory secretions', 'tracheostomy']"
Income-Related Inequality Changes in Osteoarthritis First-Line Interventions: A Cohort Study.,"To examine income-related inequality changes in the outcomes of an osteoarthritis (OA) first-line intervention.Retrospective cohort study.Swedish health care system.We included 115,403 people (age: 66.2±9.7 years; females 67.8%; N=115,403) with knee (67.8%) or hip OA (32.4%) recorded in the ""Swedish Osteoarthritis Registry"" (SOAR).Exercise and education.Erreygers' concentration index (E) measured income-related inequalities in ""Pain intensity,"" ""Self-efficacy,"" ""Use of NSAIDs,"" and ""Desire for surgery"" at baseline, 3-month, and 12-month follow-ups and their differences over time. E-values range from -1 to +1 if the health variables are more concentrated among people with lower or higher income. Zero represents perfect equality. We used entropy balancing to address demographic and outcome imbalances and bootstrap replications to estimate confidence intervals for E differences over time.Comparing baseline to 3 months, ""pain"" concentrated more among individuals with lower income initially (E=-0.027), intensifying at 3 months (difference with baseline: E=-0.011 [95% CI: -0.014; -0.008]). Similarly, the ""Desire for surgery"" concentrated more among individuals with lower income initially (E=-0.009), intensifying at 3 months (difference with baseline: E=-0.012 [-0.018; -0.005]). Conversely, ""Self-efficacy"" concentrated more among individuals with higher income initially (E=0.058), intensifying at 3 months (difference with baseline: E=0.008 [0.004; 0.012]). Lastly, the ""Use of NSAIDs"" concentrated more among individuals with higher income initially (E=0.068) but narrowed at 3 months (difference with baseline: E=-0.029 [-0.038; -0.021]). Comparing baseline with 12 months, ""pain"" concentrated more among individuals with lower income initially (E=-0.024), intensifying at 12 months (difference with baseline: E=-0.017 [-0.022; -0.012]). Similarly, the ""Desire for surgery"" concentrated more among individuals with lower income initially (E=-0.016), intensifying at 12 months (difference with baseline: E=-0.012 [-0.022; -0.002]). Conversely, ""Self-efficacy"" concentrated more among individuals with higher income initially (E=0.059), intensifying at 12 months (difference with baseline: E=0.016 [0.011; 0.021]). The variable 'Use of NSAIDs' was not recorded in the SOAR at 12-month follow-up.Our results highlight the increase of income-related inequalities in the SOAR over time.","['Epidemiology', 'Health Policy', 'National Health Programs', 'Personal Health Services', 'Physical Therapy Specialty', 'Rehabilitation']"
Effectiveness and safety of tripterygium glycosides tablet for lupus nephritis: a systematic review and Meta-analysis.,"To investigate the effectiveness and safety of tripterygium glycosides (TG) tablet for the treatment of Lupus nephritis (LN).Several databases were systematically searched including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Wiley, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Database, SinoMed and Wanfang Library till June 20, 2020. Revman5.3 was utilized to analyze the data according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Statement.In total, 8 randomized controlled trials involving 583 participants were identified. Meta-analyses showed that, compared with glucocorticoids (GC) alone, the combination with TG tablet provided a statistically significant improvement in total remission (TR) ( = 1.27, 95% : 1.08-1.50, = 0.004), complete remission (CR) ( = 1.61, 95% : 1.05-2.47, = 0.03) and C3 levels ( = 0.27, 95% : 0.14-0.39, < 0.000 1), C4 levels ( = 0.12, 95% : 0.07-0.17, < 0.000 01). No significant differences were seen in TR, CR, proteinuria, serum creatinine, C3 and C4 (TR: = 1.00, 95% : 0.87-1.16, = 0.95; CR: = 1.10, 95% : 0.78-1.56, = 0.58; proteinuria levels: = -0.06, 95% : -0.13 to 0.01, = 0.10; serum creatinine levels: = -0.01, 95%: -7.36 to 7.35, = 1.00; C3 levels: = 0.01, 95%: -0.06 to 0.07, = 0.84; C4 levels: = -0.01, 95%: -0.03 to 0.01, = 0.49) between azathioprine (AZA) / leflomit (LEF) + GC and TG tablet + GC. Adverse events (hepatic dysfunction, nausea, vomitting) showed no statistical differences between the TG tablet + GC group and the GC group. There were more new onset of irregular menstruation in the TG tablet + GC group than those in the AZA + GC ( = 3.57, 95% : 1.40-9.11, = 0.008) /LEF+ GC ( = 6.69, 95% : 2.42-18.46, = 0.000 2) group, but leucopenia lower than those in AZA + GC group ( = 0.38, 95% : 0.17-0.85, = 0.02) and alopecia ( = 0.14, 95% : 0.03-0.77, = 0.02) and rash ( = 0.09, 95% : 0.01-0.69, = 0.02) lower than those in LEF + GC group.This review indicates that TG tablet maybe effective in LN treatment. Nevertheless, adverse events cannot be ignored. Large sample, multi-center, high-quality clinical studies are needed to verify the exact effects and safety of TG tablet in treatment of LN.","['Metaanalysis', 'lupus nephritis', 'safety', 'systematic review', 'treatment outcome', 'tripterygium glycosides']"
"Role of Phytoestrogen-Rich Bioactive Substances (<i>Linum usitatissimum</i> L., <i>Glycine max</i> L., <i>Trifolium pratense</i> L.) in Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Postmenopausal Women: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.","The aim of this report was to determine the impact of flaxseed, soy and red clover, and their bioactive substances on the lipid profile in postmenopausal women in cardiovascular diseases prevention. We used the following databases: MEDLINE (PubMed), EMBASE and the Cochrane Library. Meta-analysis indicates that the intake of flaxseed by postmenopausal women is associated with a statistically significant reduction in total cholesterol (TC) levels (weighted-mean difference (WMD) = -0.26; 95% confidence interval (95% CI): -0.38 to -0.13; <i>p</i> = 0.0001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (WMD = -0.19; 95% CI: -0.30 to -0.08; <i>p</i> = 0.0006), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels (WMD = -0.06; 95% CI: -0.11 to -0.01; <i>p</i> = 0.0150). The effect of soy protein on the lipid profile showed a significant decrease in TC levels: WMD = -0.15; 95% CI: -0.25-0.05; <i>p</i> = 0.0048, LDL-C levels: WMD = -0.15; 95% CI: -0.25-0.05; <i>p</i> = 0.0067, as well as a significant increase in HDL-C levels: WMD = 0.05; 95% CI: 0.02-0.08; <i>p</i> = 0.0034. Changes in the lipid profile showed a significant reduction in TC levels after the use of red clover (WMD = -0.11; 95% CI: -0.18--0.04; <i>p</i> = 0.0017) and a significant increase in HDL-C levels (WMD = 0.04; 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.07; <i>p</i> = 0.0165). This meta-analysis provides evidence that consuming flaxseed, soy and red clover can have a beneficial effect on lipids in postmenopausal women and suggest a favorable effect in preventing cardiovascular diseases.","['botanical supplements', 'cardiovascular disease', 'flaxseed', 'lipid profile', 'metaanalysis', 'postmenopausal woman', 'red clover', 'soy']"
The Efficacy and Safety of Roxadustat for Anemia in Patients With Chronic Kidney Disease: A Meta-Analysis.,"<b>Background:</b> Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a global public health problem, and anemia is a common complication in CKD patients. Roxadustat (FG-4592) is an oral hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) stabilizer. Roxadustat has been shown in studies to keep up with and increase hemoglobin better than placebo or erythropoietin. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to assess the efficacy and safety of roxadustat. <b>Methods:</b> We searched CBM, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang Database, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and Web of Science for randomized controlled trials of roxadustat for the treatment of anemia in CKD patients. The papers were screened using rigorous criteria and their quality was assessed using the Cochrane 5.1.0 assessment manual for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). RevMan 5.3 was used to extract and synthesize data for meta-analysis. <b>Results:</b> There were 8 RCTs (7 articles) in all, and 1,364 patients with chronic kidney disease anemia were involved. The overall quality of the studies included was satisfactory. The meta-analysis findings revealed that roxadustat can considerably enhance hemoglobin, transferrin, and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) in both dialysis-dependent (DD) and non-dialysis-dependent (NDD) patients: Hemoglobin (Hb): DD: [SMD = 0.23, 95% CI (0.01, 0.44), <i>p</i> = 0.04], NDD: [SMD = 2.08, 95% CI (1.23, 2.93) <i>p</i> < 0.000001]; transferrin: DD: [SMD = 0.78, 95% CI (0.24, 1.32), <i>p</i> = 0.004], NDD: [SMD = 1.37, 95% CI (0.76, 1.98), <i>p</i> < 0.0001]; TIBC: DD [SMD = 0.97, 95% CI (0.64, 1.29), <i>p</i> < 0.00001], NDD [SMD = 1.34, 95% CI (0.9, 1.78), <i>p</i> < 0.00001]. After roxadustat therapy, patients' serum iron levels were considerably higher in the dialysis group than in the control group, but there was no significant change in the NDD group [SMD = 0.42, 95% CI (0.27, 0.57), <i>p</i> < 0.00001]. In the NDD group, hepcidin, ferritin, and transferrin saturation (TSAT) were significantly reduced after roxadustat treatment: Hepcidin [SMD = -1.59, 95% CI (-2.69, -0.49), <i>p</i> = 0.005], ferritin [SMD = -0.51, 95% CI (-0.72, 0.3) <i>p</i> < 0.00001], TSAT [SMD = -0.41, 95% CI (-0.62, 0.2), <i>p</i> < 0.0001]. In terms of safety, adverse events (AE) [SMD = 1.08, 95% CI (0.98, 1.18) <i>p</i> = 0.11] and serious adverse events (SAE) [SMD = 1.32, 95% CI (0.97, 1.9) <i>p</i> = 0.08] were not significantly different between the two groups. <b>Conclusion:</b> Roxadustat can improve anemia in NDD patients with chronic kidney disease, and its short-term safety was comparable to that of the comparison group.","['Anemia', 'CKD', 'FG4592', 'chronic kidney disease', 'metaanalysis', 'roxadustat']"
Higher Order Aberrations following Scleral Buckling Surgery in Patients with Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment.,"We aim to evaluate magnitudes of higher order aberrations (HOAs) from 3rd-6th order after scleral buckling (SB) for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). A retrospective cross-sectional study of 19 patients with RRD who received SB (six receiving encircling SB, thirteen receiving segmental SB) was conducted. A wavefront analysis for surveying HOAs and other ophthalmic parameters were collected. Data between operated and fellow eyes, and a subgroup analysis of operated eyes, were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test, while a generalized linear model was applied to evaluate the correlation of HOAs to best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and optical symptoms. BCVA in the operated eyes was significantly worse (LogMAR: 0.18 ± 0.23 versus 0.05 ± 0.07, <i>p</i> = 0.001). Tilt (0.32 ± 0.14 versus 0.13 ± 0.08, <i>p</i> = 0.004), defocus (1.78 ± 0.47 versus 1.05 ± 0.17, <i>p</i> = 0.019) and coma (0.43 ± 0.11 versus 0.27 ± 0.09, <i>p</i> = 0.016) were significantly increased after SB. All root mean square (RMS), including RMS-3, RMS-4 and total RMS, were higher in operated eyes (all <i>p</i> < 0.05). Regarding Zernike terms, a significant elevation of vertical coma in the operated eyes was found (<i>p</i> = 0.038). In addition, tilt (0.41 ± 0.10 versus 0.17 ± 0.12, <i>p</i> = 0.007), defocus (2.27 ± 0.58 versus 0.82 ± 0.39, <i>p</i> = 0.001) and coma (0.59 ± 0.17 versus 0.11 ± 0.10, <i>p</i> = 0.015) were higher in the segmental subgroup, whereas spherical aberration (SA) was higher in the encircling subgroup (0.22 ± 0.04 versus 0.40 ± 0.15, <i>p</i> = 0.024) and RMS-4 and total RMS were increased in the segmental subgroup (both <i>p</i> < 0.05). Besides, tilt was correlated to worse BCVA (<i>p</i> = 0.036), whereas all four HOAs were correlated to the presence of optical symptoms (all <i>p</i> < 0.05). In conclusion, SB may increase HOAs, which could be associated with unfavorable postoperative visual outcomes and subject symptoms.","['Zernike term', 'higher order aberrations', 'rhegmatogenous retinal detachment', 'scleral buckling', 'wavefront analysis']"
Might definitive local therapy of the primary tumor improve the survival benefits of metastatic prostate cancer?-evidence from a meta-analysis.,"With the successful application of local therapy (LT) of the primary tumor in other metastatic disease and the demonstration of their better survival benefits, the traditionally seldom involved role of LT for metastatic prostate cancer (mPCa) had gained a lot of interest. Hence, this meta-analysis was conducted to clarify its efficacy in mPCa.A comprehensive search of major databases (PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science) was conducted for eligible studies, up to May 2019. The pooled hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was utilized to evaluate the efficacy of LT for mPCa.A total of 12 eligible studies with 78,864 participants, containing 28 different comparisons were ultimately enrolled in this article. Our results showed that LT involving radical prostatectomy (RP) or radiation therapy (RT) for mPCa was related to enhanced overall survival (OS) (pooled HR =0.53, 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.61, I2=59.7%, P=0.015), decreased cancer-specific mortality (CSM) (pooled HR =0.42, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.51, I2=63.1%, P=0.004) and lower all-cause mortality (ACM) (pooled HR =0.37, 95% CI: 0.31 to 0.45, I2=49.4%, P=0.115), compared with no local therapy (NLT). In subsequent stratified analysis, RP or RT was respectively linked to longer OS (pooled HR =0.49, 95% CI: 0.44 to 0.54, I2=0.0%, P=0.741; pooled HR =0.64, 95% CI: 0.56 to 0.72, I2=15.4%, P=0.306), lower CSM (pooled HR =0.37, 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.46, I2=35.2%, P=0.187; pooled HR =0.51, 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.63, I2=27.0%, P=0.250) and decreased ACM (pooled HR =0.31, 95% CI: 0.23 to 0.40, I2=56.4%, P=0.130; pooled HR =0.44, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.56, I2=0.0%, P=0.856), compared with NLT. In terms of RP vs. RT, RP was linked to a decreased CSM (pooled HR =0.59, 95% CI: 0.53 to 0.66, I2=0.0%, P=0.653).In summary, our results shed light on the positive role of LT (RP or RT) for mPCa and meanwhile its feasibility and survival benefits had been demonstrated. Moreover, when compared with RT, RP showed its superiority in CSM. Upcoming prospective randomized controlled trials should be taken to validate our findings.","['Local therapy LT', 'metaanalysis', 'metastatic prostate cancer mPCa', 'radiation therapy RT', 'radical prostatectomy RP']"
Correlation of Change in Macular Thickness With Change in Visual Acuity in Diabetic Macular Edema: Post Hoc Analysis of VISTA and VIVID Trials.,"<b>Purpose:</b> To assess the correlation between the change in central subfield thickness (CST) and change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in eyes with diabetic macular edema (DME) treated with fixed-dosing intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI). <b>Methods:</b> This post hoc analysis of the VISTA and VIVID randomized controlled clinical trials, in which 862 eyes with central-involved DME were randomly assigned to IAI 2 mg every 4 weeks (2q4; 290 eyes), IAI 2 mg every 8 weeks after 5 initial monthly doses (2q8; 286 eyes), or macular laser (286 eyes) and followed through 100 weeks. Correlations between the change in CST and change in BCVA from baseline to weeks 12, 52, and 100 were assessed using the Pearson correlation. <b>Results:</b> The respective correlations (<i>r</i> [95% CI]) at weeks 12, 52, and 100 were -0.39 (-0.49 to -0.29), -0.27 (-0.38 to -0.15), and -0.30 (-0.41 to -0.17) in the 2q4 arm and -0.28 (-0.39 to -0.17), -0.29 (-0.41 to -0.17), and -0.33 (-0.44 to -0.20) in the 2q8 arm. Linear regression analysis of the correlation at week 100, adjusted for relevant baseline factors, showed CST changes accounted for 17% of the variance in BCVA changes; every 100-µm decrease in CST was associated with a 1.2-letter increase in BCVA (<i>P</i> = .001). <b>Conclusions:</b> Correlations between the change in CST and change in BCVA after 2q4 or 2q8 fixed-dosing IAI for DME were modest. Although a change in CST might be important in determining the need for antivascular endothelial growth factor for DME at follow-up, it was not a good surrogate for VA outcomes.","['aflibercept', 'antiVEGF', 'central subfield thickness', 'correlation', 'diabetic macular edema', 'visual acuity']"
Test-retest reliability of high-resolution surface electromyographic activities of facial muscles during facial expressions in healthy adults: A prospective observational study.,"Surface electromyography (sEMG) is a standard method for psycho-physiological research to evaluate emotional expressions or in a clinical setting to analyze facial muscle function. High-resolution sEMG shows the best results to discriminate between different facial expressions. Nevertheless, the test-retest reliability of high-resolution facial sEMG is not analyzed in detail yet, as good reliability is a necessary prerequisite for its repeated clinical application.Thirty-six healthy adult participants (53% female, 18-67 years) were included. Electromyograms were recorded from both sides of the face using an arrangement of electrodes oriented by the underlying topography of the facial muscles (Fridlund scheme) and simultaneously by a geometric and symmetrical arrangement on the face (Kuramoto scheme). In one session, participants performed three trials of a standard set of different facial expression tasks. On one day, two sessions were performed. The two sessions were repeated two weeks later. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation statistics were used to analyze the intra-session, intra-day, and between-day reliability.Fridlund scheme, mean ICCs per electrode position: Intra-session: excellent (0.935-0.994), intra-day: moderate to good (0.674-0.881), between-day: poor to moderate (0.095-0.730). Mean ICC's per facial expression: Intra-session: excellent (0.933-0.991), intra-day: good to moderate (0.674-0.903), between-day: poor to moderate (0.385-0.679). Kuramoto scheme, mean ICC's per electrode position: Intra-session: excellent (0.957-0.970), intra-day: good (0.751-0.908), between-day: moderate (0.643-0.742). Mean ICC's per facial expression: Intra-session: excellent (0.927-0.991), intra-day: good to excellent (0.762-0.973), between-day: poor to good (0.235-0.868). The intra-session reliability of both schemes were equal. Compared to the Fridlund scheme, the ICCs for intra-day and between-day reliability were always better for the Kuramoto scheme.For repeated facial sEMG measurements of facial expressions, we recommend the Kuramoto scheme.","['electromyography', 'emotional expression', 'face', 'facial palsy', 'mimic muscles', 'reliability—reproducibility of results']"
Short-term effectiveness of baricitinib in children with refractory and/or severe juvenile dermatomyositis.,"To determine the short-term effectiveness safety of baricitinib in children with refractory and/or severe juvenile dermatomyositis (rsJDM) in a real-world setting.This was a single-center retrospective study, including 20 children with rsJDM. They were all treated using baricitinib combined with steroids and other immunosuppressive agents. The childhood myositis assessment scale (CMAS) and PRINTO remission criteria were used to evaluate the disease severity and treatment outcome at 0, 4, 12, and 24 weeks after initiation of baricitinib.The skin rash improved in 95% of patients (19/20) at week 24, with a significant decrease of skin-DAS at weeks 12 (6.0 vs. 2.0, <i>p</i> < 0.05] and week 24 [6.0 vs. 1.0, <i>p</i> < 0.05) by median statistics. The CMAS score increased significantly at week 12 (41.0 [29.0, 44.0] vs. 46.0 [42.0, 52.0], <i>p</i> < 0.05) and week 24 (41.0 [29.0, 44.0] vs. 50.0 [45.0, 52.0], <i>p</i> < 0.05), as did the manual muscle testing (MMT)-8 score at week 24 (73.0 [610, 76.0] vs. 79.0 [77.0, 80.0], <i>p</i> < 0.05). At 24 weeks, the complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) were achieved in 75% (15/20) and 15% (3/20), respectively. The dose of corticosteroids (CS) decreased by 37% from the baseline (0.53 [0.42, 1.00] mg/kg) to week 12 (0.33 [0.18, 0.40] mg/kg) (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and by 49% at week 24 (<i>p</i> < 0.05). No serious side effects were observed.Baricitinib combined with traditional immunosuppressants treatment was efficacious in rsJDM. Add-on therapy of baricitinib was helpful for tapering CS dose. No serious side effects were observed in this study.","['baricitinib', 'juvenile dermatomyositis', 'refractory', 'severe', 'treatment']"
Young Adults' Loneliness and Depression During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Moderated Mediation Model.,"Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019, millions of people have been infected with the disease. The COVID-19 pandemic also produced severe mental health problems, such as loneliness and depression. The present study aimed to examine the mediating role of cognitive reappraisal and moderating role of resilience in the relationship between young adults' loneliness and depression during the pandemic by adopting a cross-sectional research approach. In March 2020, 654 young adults (18-29 years old) were recruited to complete the measures for loneliness, depression, emotion regulation, and resilience. Results found that loneliness was positively and moderately associated with depression (<i>r</i> = 0.531, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and that both loneliness and depression were separately negatively associated with cognitive reappraisal (<i>r</i> = -0.348, <i>p</i> < 0.001; <i>r</i> = -0.424, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and resilience (<i>r</i> = -0.436, <i>p</i> < 0.001; <i>r</i> = -0.419, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The results indicated that both loneliness and depression were not associated with expressive suppression (<i>r</i> = 0.067, <i>p</i> = 0.087; <i>r</i> = -0.002, <i>p</i> = 0.961). The moderated mediation model results revealed that only cognitive reappraisal partially mediated the relationship between loneliness and depression (<i>b</i> = -0.301; <i>Boot</i> 95% <i>CI</i> = -0.388, -0.215). In addition, the results of the moderated mediation model indicated that resilience moderated the association between loneliness and depression (<i>b</i> = 0.035, <i>p</i> < 0.001, <i>Boot 95% CI</i> = 0.014, 0.055), while also moderated the impact of cognitive reappraisal on depression (<i>b</i> = -0.031, <i>p</i> < 0.001, <i>Boot 95% CI</i> = -0.058, -0.005). These findings have practical implications that broaden our understanding of depression in young adults and shed light on how to enhance cognitive reappraisal and resilience as a means of combating depression in this age group during the COVID-19 pandemic.","['cognitive reappraisal', 'depression', 'loneliness', 'protective factors', 'resilience']"
Acute Myocardial Infarction Detection Using Deep Learning-Enabled Electrocardiograms.,"<b>Background:</b> Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is associated with a poor prognosis. Therefore, accurate diagnosis and early intervention of the culprit lesion are of extreme importance. Therefore, we developed a neural network algorithm in this study to automatically diagnose AMI from 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). <b>Methods:</b> We used the open-source PTB-XL database as the training and validation sets, with a 7:3 sample size ratio. Twenty-One thousand, eight hundred thirty-seven clinical 12-lead ECGs from the PTB-XL dataset were available for training and validation (15,285 were used in the training set and 6,552 in the validation set). Additionally, we randomly selected 205 ECGs from a dataset built by Chapman University, CA, USA and Shaoxing People's Hospital, China, as the testing set. We used a residual network for training and validation. The model performance was experimentally verified in terms of area under the curve (AUC), precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. <b>Results:</b> The AUC of the training, validation, and testing sets were 0.964 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.961-0.966], 0.944 (95% CI: 0.939-0.949), and 0.977 (95% CI: 0.961-0.991), respectively. The precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score of the deep learning model for AMI diagnosis from ECGs were 0.827, 0.824, 0.950, and 0.825, respectively, in the training set, 0.789, 0.818, 0.913, and 0.803, respectively, in the validation set, and 0.830, 0.951, 0.951, and 0.886, respectively, in the testing set. The AUC for automatic AMI location diagnosis of LMI, IMI, ASMI, AMI, ALMI were 0.969 (95% CI: 0.959-0.979), 0.973 (95% CI: 0.962-0.978), 0.987 (95% CI: 0.963-0.989), 0.961 (95% CI: 0.956-0.989), and 0.996 (95% CI: 0.957-0.997), respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> The residual network-based algorithm can effectively automatically diagnose AMI and MI location from 12-lead ECGs.","['acute myocardial infarction', 'convolutional neural network', 'deep learning', 'electrocardiogram', 'residual network']"
"Maternal perception, concern and dissatisfaction with child weight and their association with feeding practices in the Generation XXI birth cohort.","What a mother thinks about her child's weight status might influence what and how she feeds her child. We examined the association between maternal perception, concern and dissatisfaction with child weight alongside feeding practices. Participants were from the Generation XXI birth cohort (n = 3233). A validated version of the Child Feeding Questionnaire and the Overt/Covert Control scale were used. Associations were evaluated by linear regression models (β coefficients and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CI) with Bonferroni correction). Perceived underweight was associated with practices promoting food intake, such as higher pressure to eat at ages 4 and 7 years (β = 0·229; 95 % CI: 0·059, 0·398 and β = 0·190; 95 % CI:0·005, 0·376, respectively) and lower restriction at age 4 (β = -0·175; 95 % CI: -0·0310, -0·039). At age 7, perceived overweight was associated with higher covert control (β = 0·203; 95 % CI: 0·029, 0·376). Mothers who were concerned about child weight reported higher restriction (β = 0·226; 95 % CI: 0·142, 0·310 at 4 years and β = 0·261; 95 % CI: 0·169, 0·353 at 7 years) and covert control (β = 0·183; 95 % CI: 0·083, 0·282 at 4 years and β = 0·171; 95 % CI: 0·073, 0·269 at 7 years). Maternal desire for a heavier child was associated with higher pressure to eat at both ages (β = 0·285; 95 % CI: 0·163, 0·406 and β = 0·393; 95 % CI: 0·266, 0·520), while the desire for a thinner child was related to higher covert control at 7 years of age (β = 0·158; 95 % CI: 0·001, 0·316). Maternal perceptions and concern for child weight status are associated with feeding practices independently of actual weight status.","['Children', 'Feeding practices', 'Maternal concern', 'Maternal perception', 'Weight']"
Effects of Carnitine on Nutritional Parameters in Patients with Chronic Kidney Disease: An Updated Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Protein energy malnutrition is a common problem in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). Scattered reports indicate that supplementation of Carnitine may improve patients' clinical symptoms, with significant improvement in nutritional parameters. This systematic review was done to document the evidences of Carnitine effects in nutritional status of CKD patients. Peer-reviewed RCTs on Carnitine administration at any dose in CKD patients with at least four weeks of follow-up were including in the meta-analysis. Online databases (PubMed/Medline, ISI Web of Science, Embase, and Scopus) were searched to October 2017 using selected MeSH terms related to the study topic. Data was extracted independently by two reviewers using a standard form and then cross-checked. Statistical analyses were carried out with Comprehensive Meta-analysis software. Data are presented as standard mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI). According to the predefined criteria, a total of 14 randomized controlled clinical trials were included and screened for data extraction by two reviewers, separately. The preliminary results extracted from meta-analysis have shown that Carnitine can significantly increase the levels of albumin (SMD: -0.861; 95% CI: -1.321, -0.402), total protein (SMD: -0.418; 95% CI: -0.695, -0.141), total cholesterol (SMD: -0.350; 95% CI: -0.564, -0.135), LDL cholesterol (SMD: -0.362; 95% CI: -0.551, -0.173), transferrin (SMD: -1.465; 95% CI: -1.822, -1.108), and hemoglobin (SMD: -0.525; 95% CI: -0.732, -0.318); however there were no conclusive effects of Carnitine on body weight (SMD: -0.057; 95% CI: -0.404, 0.291) and BMI (SMD: -0.567; 95% CI: -1.548, 0.415), in pooled analyses. The results of this meta-analysis showed that there are considerable useful pieces of evidence so far about the effect of Carnitine on nutritional factors; however, there is still doubt about some evidences with this regard. It seems necessary to carry out clinical trials with stronger designs to evaluate the impact of these primary outcomes on the patients' clinical conditions. Having this evidences, the potential role of Carnitine in improving malnutrition consequences in CKD patients would be clearly defined.","['Carnitine', 'chronic kidney disease', 'metaanalysis', 'nutritional parameters', 'systematic review']"

"Fruit and vegetable consumption and all-cause, cancer and CVD mortality: analysis of Health Survey for England data.","Governments worldwide recommend daily consumption of fruit and vegetables. We examine whether this benefits health in the general population of England.Cox regression was used to estimate HRs and 95% CI for an association between fruit and vegetable consumption and all-cause, cancer and cardiovascular mortality, adjusting for age, sex, social class, education, BMI, alcohol consumption and physical activity, in 65 226 participants aged 35+ years in the 2001-2008 Health Surveys for England, annual surveys of nationally representative random samples of the non-institutionalised population of England linked to mortality data (median follow-up: 7.7 years).Fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with decreased all-cause mortality (adjusted HR for 7+ portions 0.67 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.78), reference category <1 portion). This association was more pronounced when excluding deaths within a year of baseline (0.58 (0.46 to 0.71)). Fruit and vegetable consumption was associated with reduced cancer (0.75 (0.59-0.96)) and cardiovascular mortality (0.69 (0.53 to 0.88)). Vegetables may have a stronger association with mortality than fruit (HR for 2 to 3 portions 0.81 (0.73 to 0.89) and 0.90 (0.82 to 0.98), respectively). Consumption of vegetables (0.85 (0.81 to 0.89) per portion) or salad (0.87 (0.82 to 0.92) per portion) were most protective, while frozen/canned fruit consumption was apparently associated with increased mortality (1.17 (1.07 to 1.28) per portion).A robust inverse association exists between fruit and vegetable consumption and mortality, with benefits seen in up to 7+ portions daily. Further investigations into the effects of different types of fruit and vegetables are warranted.","['Cancer', 'Cardiovascular disease', 'Diet', 'Mortality', 'Nutrition']"
People with Diabetes Have Poorer Self-Rated Health (SRH) and Diabetes Moderates the Association between Age and SRH.,"Diabetes is a severe chronic condition that is related to decreased physical functioning. Recently, there has been growing interest in understanding how a brief report on health such as self-rated health (SRH) could be used to track changes in health status and service needs in people with diabetes. The current research aims to investigate how SRH is affected by diabetes and how diabetes could moderate the association between age and SRH. By analyzing data from 47,507 participants, with 2869 of them clinically diagnosed with diabetes, the current study found that people with diabetes had significantly poorer SRH than people without diabetes after controlling for demographic covariates (t(2868) = -45.73, <i>p</i> < 0.001, 95% C.I. (-0.92, -0.85), Cohen's d = -0.85). In addition, diabetes was a significant moderator of the relationship between age and SRH (<i>b</i> = 0.01, <i>p</i> < 0.001, 95% C.I. (0.01, 0.01)). Specifically, age was more strongly related to SRH in people without diabetes (<i>b</i> = -0.015, <i>p</i> < 0.001, 95% C.I. (-0.016, -0.015)) than in people with diabetes (<i>b</i> = -0.007, <i>p</i> < 0.001, 95% C.I. (-0.010, -0.004)). Health professionals should aim to improve SRH in people with diabetes given that SRH is related to various outcomes.","['age', 'diabetes', 'selfrated health']"
Comparison of atlas-based auto-segmentation accuracy for radiotherapy in prostate cancer.,"Atlas-based auto-segmentation (ABS) procedure used in radiotherapy can be classified into two groups, one using one atlas per patient (sSM) and the other using multiple atlases (sMM).

Effect of the Use of Metronome Feedback on the Quality of Pediatric Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation.,"Although the use of audio feedback with devices such as metronomes during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is a simple method for improving CPR quality, its effect on the quality of pediatric CPR has not been adequately evaluated. In this study, 64 healthcare providers performed CPR (with one- and two-handed chest compression (OHCC and THCC, respectively)) on a pediatric resuscitation manikin (Resusci Junior QCPR), with and without audio feedback using a metronome (110 beats/min). CPR was performed on the floor, with a compression-to-ventilation ratio of 30:2. For both OHCC and THCC, the rate of achievement of an adequate compression rate during CPR was significantly higher when performed with metronome feedback than that without metronome feedback (CPR with vs. without feedback: 100.0% (99.0, 100.0) vs. 94.0% (69.0, 99.0), <i>p</i> < 0.001, for OHCC, and 100.0% (98.5, 100.0) vs. 91.0% (34.5, 98.5), <i>p</i> < 0.001, for THCC). However, the rate of achievement of adequate compression depth during the CPR performed was significantly higher without metronome feedback than that with metronome feedback (CPR with vs. without feedback: 95.0% (23.5, 99.5) vs. 98.5% (77.5, 100.0), <i>p</i> = 0.004, for OHCC, and 99.0% (95.5, 100.0) vs. 100.0% (99.0, 100.0), <i>p</i> = 0.003, for THCC). Although metronome feedback during pediatric CPR could increase the rate of achievement of adequate compression rates, it could cause decreased compression depth.","['cardiopulmonary resuscitation', 'feedback', 'manikins', 'pediatrics']"
Manipulation of Breath Alcohol Tests: Can Specific Techniques Alter Breath Alcohol Content?,"The most common form of measurement of breath alcohol content (BrAC) is through the use of a diode catheter. This study aims to test the accuracy of breath alcohol analysis through different manipulations.BrAC was measured after individuals consumed each standardized beer until they reached a 0.1 BrAC. Then, the individuals were breath analyzed while not providing full effort, using the side of their mouths, immediately after hyperventilating, 5 and 10 min after hyperventilation, immediately after a sip of water, and 5 min after that water.There were 54 individuals. Two baselines were used as the controls. The first baseline was a mean BrAC of. 104 with standard deviation of +0.008 for poor effort, side of mouth, and hyperventilating. The second baseline used for drinking water manipulations was a BrAC of 0.099 + 0.11. Poor effort (mean + standard deviation: 0.099 ± 0.10, <i>P</i> < 0.0001), immediately after hyperventilating (0.086 ± 0.011, <i>P</i> < 0.0001), 5 min after hyperventilating (0.099 ± 0.009, <i>P</i> < 0.0001), and 10 min after hyperventilating (0.099 ± 0.011, <i>P</i> < 0.0001) were all found to be statistically significant in their ability to lower BrAC. Both immediately after water (0.084 ± 0.011, <i>P</i> < 0001) and 5 min after drinking water (0.096 ± 0.13, <i>P</i> < 0.0001) were found to have significantly altered the BrAC.Our research shows that manipulations can alter BrAC readings significantly. Breath analyzer operators should be cognizant of these methods that may lead to falsely lower BrAC readings.","['Alcohol intoxication', 'breath alcohol content', 'breathalyzer']"
Associations between apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and KI 67 in different tumors: a meta-analysis. Part 1: ADC<sub>mean</sub>.,"Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique based on measure of water diffusion in tissues. This diffusion can be quantified by apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC). Some reports indicated that ADC can reflect tumor proliferation potential. The purpose of this meta-analysis was to provide evident data regarding associations between ADC and KI 67 in different tumors. Studies investigating the relationship between ADC and KI 67 in different tumors were identified. MEDLINE library was screened for associations between ADC and KI 67 in different tumors up to April 2017. Overall, 42 studies with 2026 patients were identified. The following data were extracted from the literature: authors, year of publication, number of patients, tumor type, and correlation coefficients. Associations between ADC and KI 67 were analyzed by Spearman's correlation coefficient. The reported Pearson correlation coefficients in some studies were converted into Spearman correlation coefficients. The pooled correlation coefficient between ADC<sub>mean</sub> and KI 67 for all included tumors was <i>ρ</i> = -0.44. Furthermore, correlation coefficient for every tumor entity was calculated.

Ketamine for the treatment of major depression: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Intranasal esketamine has received regulatory approvals for the treatment of depression. Recently a large trial of repeated dose racemic ketamine also demonstrated efficacy in severe depression. However, uncertainties remain regarding comparative efficacy, dosage, and the time course of response.In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched Embase, Medline, Pubmed, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL up to April 13, 2023, for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating ketamine for depression. Two investigators independently assessed study eligibility and risk of bias and extracted the data on depression severity scores, response and remission rates, and all-cause dropouts. Multivariable mixed-effects meta-regressions incorporated drug formulation (racemic (Rac) or esketamine (Esket)) and dose (Low or High) as covariates. Treatment effects were assessed: immediately following the first dose, during further repeated dosing, and follow-up after the final dose of a treatment course. This study is registered with PROSPERO (CRD42021221157).The systematic review identified 687 articles, of which 49 RCTs were eligible for analysis, comprising 3299 participants. Standardised mean differences (95% confidence intervals) immediately following the first/single treatment were moderate-high for all conditions (Rac-High: -0.73, -0.91 to -0.56; Esket-High: -0.48, -0.75 to -0.20; Rac-Low: -0.33, -0.54 to -0.12; Esket-Low: -0.55, -0.87 to -0.24). Ongoing effects during repeated dosing were significantly greater than the control for Rac-High (-0.61; -1.02 to -0.20) and Rac-Low (-0.55, -1.09 to -0.00), but not Esket-Low (-0.15, -0.49 to 0.19) or Esket-High (-0.22, -0.54 to 0.10). At follow-up effects remained significant for racemic ketamine (-0.65; -1.23 to -0.07) but not esketamine (-0.33; -0.96 to 0.31). All-cause dropout was similar between experiment and control conditions for both formulations combined (Odds Ratio = 1.18, 0.85-1.64). Overall heterogeneity varied from 5.7% to 87.6.Our findings suggested that effect sizes for depression severity, as well as response and remission rates, were numerically greater for racemic ketamine than esketamine. Higher doses were more effective than low doses. Differences were evident in initial effects, ongoing treatment, and lasting effects after the final dose.None.","['Depression', 'Ketamine', 'Metaanalysis', 'Systematic review']"
Evaluation of the LFA-REAL clinician-reported outcome (ClinRO) and patient-reported outcome (PRO): prespecified analysis of the phase III ustekinumab trial in patients with SLE.,"The Lupus Foundation of America Rapid Evaluation of Activity in Lupus (LFA-REAL) system is a novel and simple SLE disease activity instrument, consisting of a tandem clinician-reported (ClinRO) and patient-reported (PRO) outcome measure. The aim of this study was to compare the LFA-REAL system with other SLE activity measures in the phase III trial of ustekinumab in patients with active SLE.This was a prespecified analysis of data from a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial conducted at 140 sites in 20 countries. Correlations were evaluated between the LFA-REAL ClinRO and PRO with a panel of clinician-reported and patient-reported disease activity measures commonly used in SLE clinical trials at baseline, week 24 and week 52. All p values are reported as nominal.Trial participants included 516 patients with SLE with a mean (SD) age of 43.5 (8.9), of whom 482 (93.4%) were female. The LFA-REAL ClinRO correlated with Physician Global Assessment (r=0.39, 0.65 and 0.74, p<0.001), British Isles Lupus Assessment Group Index (r=0.43, 0.67 and 0.73, p<0.001) and SLE Disease Activity Index-2000 (r=0.35, 0.60 and 0.62, p<0.001). The LFA-REAL ClinRO arthralgia/arthritis score correlated well with active joint counts (r=0.54, 0.73 and 0.68, p<0.001) and the mucocutaneous global score correlated strongly with Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index total activity (r=0.57, 0.77 and 0.81, p<0.001). The LFA-REAL PRO demonstrated a moderate correlation with Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (r=-0.60, -0.55 and -0.58, p<0.001), Lupus QoL physical health (r=-0.42, -0.47 and -0.46, p<0.001), SF-36v2 vitality (r=-0.40, -0.43 and -0.58, p<0.001) and SF-36v2 Physical Component Summary (r=-0.45, -0.53 and -0.53, p<0.001). The LFA-REAL ClinRO and PRO showed a moderate correlation with each other (r=0.32, 0.45 and 0.50, p<0.001).The LFA-REAL ClinRO and PRO showed varied levels of correlations (weak to strong) with existing physician-based lupus disease activity measures and patient-reported outcome instruments, respectively and were able to more accurately capture organ-specific mucocutaneous and musculoskeletal manifestations. More analyses are needed to determine areas in which patient-reported outcomes are most similar or different to physician-reported end points and the basis for differences.","['arthritis', 'lupus erythematosus', 'systemic', 'outcome assessment', 'health care', 'therapeutics']"

Besides, the total effects of SXN to improve mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) [SMD = 0.12, 95% CI (-0.16, 0.4), <i>p</i> = 0.41], mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) [SMD = 0.03, 95% CI (-0.18, 0.24), <i>p</i> = 0.77], hematocrit (HCT) [SMD = 0.65, 95% CI (-0.25, 1.55), <i>p</i> = 0.16], and serum ferritin (SF) levels [SMD = 0.59, 95% CI (-0.67, 1.85), <i>p</i> = 0.36] and reduce the total iron binding capacity (TIBC) [SMD = 0.34, 95% CI (-0.07, 0.74), <i>p</i> = 0.1] was comparable to that of iron supplementation. SXN significantly raised the total effective rates of IDA [risk ratio (RR) = 1.06, 95% CI (1.02, 1.09), <i>p</i> = 0.0005] and was associated with fewer adverse events [RR = 0.24, 95% CI (0.18, 0.31), <i>p</i> < 0.00001], fewer adverse pregnancy outcomes [RR = 0.34, 95% CI (0.2, 0.57), <i>p</i> < 0.0001], and lower anemia recurrence rates during pregnancy [RR = 0.29, 95% CI (0.1, 0.84), <i>p</i> = 0.02]. Regarding prevention, the effects of SXN to maintain the RBC count, Hb level and other IDA-related parameters were comparable to that of control group and SXN reduced the risk of IDA incidence during pregnancy. <b>Conclusion:</b> SXN demonstrated promising efficacy in the treatment and prevention of IDA and outperformed routine iron formulations in terms of safety, thus rendering SXN a reliable treatment option for IDA. <b>Systematic Review Registration:</b> https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier: CRD42022353247.","['Shengxuening tablet', 'iron deficiency anemia', 'metaanalysis', 'random controlled trials', 'systematic review']"
The Effects of Patient Education on Psychological Status and Clinical Outcomes in Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common systemic inflammatory autoimmune disease. The disease has a serious impact on mental health and requires more effective non-pharmacological interventions.This study aims to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of patient education on psychological status and clinical outcomes in rheumatoid arthritis.This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE database, and Web of Science database were screened for articles published until November 2, 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of patient education for RA were included. Outcomes measures included pain, physical function, disease activity, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), anxiety, depression, Arthritis Self-Efficacy (pain, other symptoms, total), and General health. For each outcome, standardized mean differences or mean differences and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.A total of 24 RCTs (<i>n</i> = 2,276) were included according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Meta-analysis revealed a statistically significant overall effect in favor of patient education for physical function [SMD = -0.52, 95% CI (-0.96, -0.08), <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 93%, <i>P</i> = 0.02], disease activity [SMD = -1.97, 95% CI (-3.24, -0.71), <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 97%, <i>P</i> = 0.002], ASE (pain) [SMD = -1.24, 95% CI (-2.05, -0.43), <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 95%, <i>P</i> = 0.003], ASE (other symptoms) [SMD = -0.25, 95% CI (-0.41, -0.09), <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 25%, <i>P</i> = 0.002], ASE (total) [SMD = -0.67, 95% CI (-1.30, -0.05), <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 90%, <i>P</i> = 0.03], and general health [SMD = -1.11, 95% CI (-1.36, -0.86), <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 96%, P < 0.00001]. No effects were found for anxiety [SMD = 0.17, 95% CI (-0.64, 0.98), <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 82%, <i>P</i> = 0.68], depression [SMD = -0.18, 95% CI (-0.52, 0.15), <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 52%, <i>P</i> = 0.28], pain [SMD = -0.37, 95% CI (-0.80, 0.05), <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 89%, <i>P</i> = 0.08], and CRP [SMD = -0.27, 95% CI (-0.57, 0.02), <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%, <i>P</i> = 0.07].Patient education may be effective in improving clinical outcomes and psychological status in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Considering the methodological limitations of the included RCTs, more high-quality and large-sample RCTs are needed to confirm this conclusion in the future.http://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero, identifier: CRD42021250607.","['metaanalysis', 'patient education', 'psychotherapy', 'rheumatoid arthritis', 'systematic review']"
Association between socioeconomic status and academic performance in children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease.,"Lower socioeconomic status (SES) is associated with lower academic achievement; however, this relationship is understudied in children with chronic kidney disease (CKD). This study examined the relationship between SES and academic performance in children and adolescents with CKD.A total of 377 participants aged 6-18 years with CKD stages 1-5 (n = 199), on dialysis (n = 43) or with a kidney transplant (n = 135) were recruited. Five SES measures and a composite SES index were examined for associations with parent-rated average or above average academic performance in numeracy and literacy using multivariable logistic regression.Participants' median age was 12.6 years (IQR 8.9-15.5). Adjusted odds ratios (aOR) (95%CI) for better performance in numeracy and literacy, respectively, were 0.71 (0.44-1.15) and 0.75 (0.45-1.23) for children whose caregivers had lower educational attainment; 0.46 (0.26-0.80) and 0.53 (0.30-0.93) for lower household income; 0.52 (0.32-0.85) and 0.44 (0.26-0.73) for caregivers who were unemployed; 0.68 (0.41-1.12) and 0.59 (0.35-1.00) for caregivers with poor self-rated financial status; and 0.93 (0.53-1.64) and 1.00 (0.56-1.79) for caregivers who did not own their own home. Compared with the highest SES index quartile, the aORs for better performance by SES quartile in descending order were 1.24 (0.60-2.54), 0.76 (0.37-1.58), and 0.39 (0.18-0.86) for numeracy and 0.88 (0.41-1.85), 0.77 (0.35-1.66), and 0.32 (0.14-0.72) for literacy. No interactions were identified between SES and CKD stage, child age, or gender.Across all CKD stages, children from lower SES families are less likely to perform well in literacy and numeracy than those from higher SES households. A higher resolution version of the Graphical abstract is available as Supplementary information.","['Academic achievement', 'CKD', 'Education', 'Pediatric', 'Socioeconomic status']"
Skeletal Muscle Tissue Saturation Changes Measured Using Near Infrared Spectroscopy During Exercise Are Associated With Post-Occlusive Reactive Hyperaemia.,"Measuring local haemodynamics in skeletal muscle has the potential to provide valuable insight into the oxygen delivery to tissue, especially during high demand situations such as exercise. The aim of this study was to compare the skeletal muscle microvascular response during post-occlusive reactive hyperaemia (PORH) with the response to exercise, each measured using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and to establish if associations exist between muscle measures and exercise capacity or sex. Participants were from a population-based cohort study, the Southall and Brent Revisited (SABRE) study. Skeletal muscle measures included changes in tissue saturation index at the onset of exercise (∆TSI<sub>BL-INC</sub>) and across the whole of exercise (∆TSI<sub>BL-EE</sub>), time to 50%, 95% and 100% PORH, rate of PORH recovery, area under the curve (AUC) and total oxygenated Haemoglobin (oxy-Hb) change during PORH. Exercise capacity was measured using a 6-min stepper test (6MST). Analysis was by multiple linear regression. In total, 558 participants completed the 6MST with NIRS measures of TSI (mean age±SD: 73 ± 7years, 59% male). A sub-set of 149 participants also undertook the arterial occlusion. Time to 100% PORH, recovery rate, AUC and ∆oxy-Hb were all associated with ∆TSI<sub>BL-EE</sub> (β-coefficient (95%CI): 0.05 (0.01, 0.09), <i>p</i> = 0.012; -47 (-85, -9.9), <i>p</i> = 0.014; 1.7 (0.62, 2.8), <i>p</i> = 0.002; 0.04 (0.002.0.108), <i>p</i> = 0.041, respectively). Time to 95% & 100% PORH, AUC and ∆oxy-Hb were all associated with ∆TSI<sub>BL-INC</sub> (β-coefficient (95%CI): -0.07 (-0.12,-0.02), <i>p</i> = 0.02; -0.03 (-0.05, -0.003), <i>p</i> = 0.028; 0.85 (0.18, 1.5), <i>p</i> = 0.013 & 0.05 (0.02, 0.09), <i>p</i> = 0.001, respectively). AUC and ∆Oxy-Hb were associated with steps achieved (β-coefficient (95%CI): 18.0 (2.3, 33.7), <i>p</i> = 0.025; 0.86 (0.10, 1.6), <i>p</i> = 0.027). ∆TSI<sub>BL-EE</sub> was associated with steps and highest VO<sub>2</sub> (1.7 (0.49, 2.9), <i>p</i> = 0.006; 7.7 (3.2, 12.3), <i>p</i> = 0.001). ∆TSI<sub>BL-INC</sub> was associated with steps and VO<sub>2</sub> but this difference was attenuated towards the null after adjustment for age, sex and ethnicity. ∆TSI<sub>BL-EE</sub> was greater in women (3.4 (0.4, 8.9) versus 2.1 (0.3, 7.4), <i>p</i> = 0.017) and ∆TSI<sub>BL-INC</sub> was lower in women versus men (2.4 (0.2, 10.2) versus 3.2 (0.2, 18.2), <i>p</i> = 0.016). These Local microvascular NIRS-measures are associated with exercise capacity in older adults and several measures can detect differences in microvascular reactivity between a community-based sample of men and women.","['exercise', 'microvascular', 'nearinfrared spectroscopy', 'reactive hyperaemia', 'skeletal muscle']"
"Liver fibrosis assessments using FibroScan, virtual-touch tissue quantification, the FIB-4 index, and mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer levels compared with pathological findings of liver resection specimens in patients with hepatitis C infection.","Evaluation of fibrosis stage is important to monitor progression of liver disease and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). While liver biopsy is the gold standard, the method is invasive and faces several limitations. The aim of this study was to determine correlations among METAVIR scores and FibroScan, Virtual-Touch tissue quantification (VTQ), fibrosis index based on four factors (FIB-4 index), and Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) level, and for examine differences in the reliability of non-invasive methods to evaluate fibrosis.We used liver resection specimens from patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV), correlations were assessed between METAVIR scores and non-invasive method. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the sensitivity, specificity, and cut off values of the methods.All Patients group: In F0-2 vs F3-4, the areas under the ROC curve (AUC) (0.85) of FibroScan was significantly higher than that (0.67) of FIB-4 index (p = 0.002) and that (0.67) of M2BPGi (p = 0.001). The AUC (0.83) of VTQ was significantly higher than that (0.67) of FIB-4 index (p = 0.01) and that (0.67) of M2BPGi (p = 0.002). In F0-3 vs F4, the AUC (0.86) of VTQ was significantly higher than that (0.65) of FIB-4 index (p = 0.04). The AUC (0.89) of FibroScan was significantly higher than that (0.65) of FIB-4 index (p = 0.002) and that (0.76) of M2BPGi (p = 0.02). Non-SVR group: In F0-2 vs F3-4, the AUC (0.85) of FibroScan was significantly higher than that (0.84) of FIB-4 index (p = 0.02) and that (0.73) of M2BPGi (p = 0.003). The AUC (0.84) of VTQ was significantly higher than that (0.74) of FIB-4 index (p = 0.04). In F0-3 vs F4, the AUC (0.91) of FibroScan was significantly higher than that (0.67) of FIB-4 index (p = 0.003) and that (0.78) of M2BPGi (p = 0.02). The AUC (0.88) of VTQ was significantly higher than that of FIB-4 index (0.67) and that of M2BPGi (0.78) (p = 0.04).FibroScan and VTQ best reflected the results of hepatic fibrosis diagnosis using liver resection specimens among the four examination methods evaluated.","['FibroScan', 'Fibrosis index based on four factors', 'Mac2 binding protein glycosylation isomer', 'Virtualtouch tissue quantification']"
Influence of low dose of gamma radiation and storage on some vitamins and mineral elements of dried oyster mushrooms (<i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i>).,"Mushrooms contain some of the most potent natural medicines on the planet. Vitamins A, C, D, Mineral elements, contents, as well as total soluble solids (Brix<sup>o</sup>) of dried composition of <i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i> were investigated after exposing to gamma radiation doses of 0 (control), 0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 kGy at a dose rate of 1.7 kGy per hour in air from a Cobalt 60 source (SLL 515, Hungary) batch irradiator prior to storage (0 month) and after storage (12 months) at room temperature (28 ± 2°C). Results obtained showed some significant (<i>p</i> < .05) differences due to irradiation and storage. Before storage, vitamins A, C, and D contents of dried and irradiated mushrooms ranged 0.003 ± 0.08-0.014 ± 0.08, 0.042 ± 1.06-0.132 ± 1.06, and 0.040 ± 0.76-0.057 ± 0.76 mg/g, respectively. After 12 months, vitamin contents decreased and ranged 0.0029 ± 0.08-0.010 ± 0.08, 0.038 ± 1.06-0.125 ± 1.06, and 0.031 ± 0.76-0.05 ± 0.76 mg/g for vitamins A, C, and D, respectively. Total soluble solids recorded 1.5 Brix<sup>o</sup>, however, showed no significant difference (<i>p</i> > .05) and did not change in 12 months after gamma irradiation up to 2 kGy. Sodium ranged from 14.00 ± 0.7 to 14.90 ± 0.8 mg/100 g. Potassium content varied from 30.20 ± 0.5 to 33.10 ± 0.6 mg/100 g. Magnesium content ranged 1.27 ± 0.15-3.53 ± 0.04 mg/100 g. Calcium ranged 11.00 ± 0.4-12.53 ± 0.4 ± 0.03 mg/100 g. Phosphorus content ranged 6.11 ± 0.30-6.41 ± 0.35 mg/100 g, whereas Nitrogen content was found to be 3.00 ± 0.03-3.60 ± 0.25 mg/100 g. Microelements or heavy metals included Copper; detected ranged 0.00 ± 0.00-0.02 ± 0.001 mg/100 g, Zinc content ranged 0.01 ± 0.002-0.03 ± 0.001 mg/100 g. Iron content was found to be in the range 0.29 ± 0.01-0.37 ± 0.1 mg/100 g. Manganese content was found to be in the range 0.03 ± 0.001-0.04 ± 0.01 mg/100 g. Lead content was found to be 0.00 ± 0.00-0.03 ± 0.001 mg/100 g. Food processing and storage has the potential to slightly alter the stability of vitamins in foods. <i>Pleurotus ostreatus</i> showed appreciable levels of mineral elemental composition, essential vitamins A, C, and D, and can be endorsed as a natural medicinal food product in the food and pharmaceutical industries. The heavy metals detected were with also below the upper limits permissible by the WHO standards and is thus safe for human consumption.","['P\xa0ostreatus', 'gamma irradiation', 'mineral elements', 'oyster mushrooms', 'storage', 'total soluble solids', 'vitamins']"
Muscles data compression in body sensor network using the principal component analysis in wavelet domain.,"Body sensor network is a key technology that is used for supervising the physiological information from a long distance that enables physicians to predict and diagnose effectively the different conditions. These networks include small sensors with the ability of sensing where there are some limitations in calculating and energy.In the present research, a new compression method based on the analysis of principal components and wavelet transform is used to increase the coherence. In the present method, the first analysis of the main principles is to find the principal components of the data in order to increase the coherence for increasing the similarity between the data and compression rate. Then, according to the ability of wavelet transform, data are decomposed to different scales. In restoration process of data only special parts are restored and some parts of the data that include noise are omitted. By noise omission, the quality of the sent data increases and good compression could be obtained.Pilates practices were executed among twelve patients with various dysfunctions. The results showed 0.7210, 0.8898, 0.6548, 0.6765, 0.6009, 0.7435, 0.7651, 0.7623, 0.7736, 0.8596, 0.8856 and 0.7102 compression ratios in proposed method and 0.8256, 0.9315, 0.9340, 0.9509, 0.8998, 0.9556, 0.9732, 0.9580, 0.8046, 0.9448, 0.9573 and 0.9440 compression ratios in previous method (Tseng algorithm).Comparing compression rates and prediction errors with the available results show the exactness of the proposed method.","['Body sensor network', 'Data compression', 'Prediction', 'Principal component analysis', 'Wavelet transform']"
Effect of dexmedetomidine combined with local infiltration analgesia on postoperative wound complications in patients with total knee arthroplasty: A meta-analysis.,"Dexmedetomidine has been demonstrated to be effective in the management of pain in total knee replacement (TKA). Nevertheless, a combination of a local anaesthetic and a dose of dexmedetomidine might be a better choice for post-operative pain management of TKA. The aim of this research is to determine if the combination of a local anaesthetic with dexmedetomidine during a knee replacement operation can decrease the post-operation pain. Furthermore, the effectiveness and security of dexmedetomidine combined with topical anaesthetic were evaluated for the management of post-operative TKA. Based on the research results, the author made a research on the basis of four big databases. The Cochrane Handbook on Intervention Systems Evaluation has also evaluated the quality of the literature. Seven randomized controlled trials have been established from this. It was found that the combination of local anaesthesia and dexmedetomidine had a greater effect on postoperative pain in 4 h (mean difference [MD], -0.9; 95% CI, -1.71, -0.09; p = 0.03), 8 h (MD, -0.52; 95% CI, -0.66, -0.38; p < 0.0001), 12 h (MD, -0.72; 95% CI, -1.04, -0.40; p < 0.0001), 24 h (MD, -0.49; 95% CI, -0.83, -0.14; p = 0.006), 48 h (MD, -0.51; 95% CI, -0.92, -0.11; p = 0.01). Nevertheless, because of the limited number of randomized controlled trials covered by this meta-analysis, caution should be exercised with regard to data treatment. More high quality research will be required to confirm the results.","['dexmedetomidine DEX', 'local infiltration analgesia LIA', 'total knee arthroplasty TKA', 'wound pain']"
"Validity of a low-cost friction encoder for measuring velocity, force and power in flywheel exercise devices.","The purpose of this study was to investigate the validity of a low-cost friction encoder against a criterion measure (strain gauge combined with a linear encoder) for assessing velocity, force and power in flywheel exercise devices. Ten young and physically active volunteers performed two sets of 14 maximal squats on a flywheel inertial device (YoYo Technology, Stockholm, Sweden) with five minutes rest between each set. Two different resistances were used (0.075 kg · m<sup>2</sup> for the first set; 0.025 kg · m<sup>2</sup> for the second). Mean velocity (V<sub>rep</sub>), force (F<sub>rep</sub>) and power (P<sub>rep</sub>) for each repetition were assessed simultaneously via a friction encoder (Chronojump, Barcelona, Spain), and with a strain gauge combined with a linear encoder (MuscleLab 6000, Ergotest Technology, Porsgrunn, Norway). Results are displayed as (Mean [CI 90%]). Compared to criterion measures, mean bias for the practical measures of V<sub>rep</sub>, F<sub>rep</sub> and P<sub>rep</sub> were moderate (-0.95 [-0.99 to -0.92]), small (0.53 [0.50 to 0.56]) and moderate (-0.68 [-0.71 to -0.65]) respectively. The typical error of estimate (TEE) was small for all three parameters; V<sub>rep</sub> (0.23 [0.20 to 0.25]), F<sub>rep</sub> (0.20 [0.18 to 0.22]) and P<sub>rep</sub> (0.18 [0.16 to 0.20]). Correlations with MuscleLab were nearly perfect for all measures in all load configurations. Based on these findings, the friction encoder provides valid measures of velocity, force and power in flywheel exercise devices. However, as error did exist between measures, the same testing protocol should be used when assessing changes in these parameters over time, or when aiming to perform inter-individual comparisons.","['Feedback', 'Isoinertial', 'Monitoring', 'Resistance Training']"
Vitamin D supplementation positively affects anthropometric indices: Evidence obtained from an umbrella meta-analysis.,"Despite the growing evidence from meta-analyses on vitamin D's anti-obesity properties, their results are controversial. The current umbrella review was performed to assess the available evidence and provide a conclusive explanation in this regard. The international databases PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science and Google Scholar were systematically searched till March, 2022. A random-effects model was used to run the meta-analysis. All meta-analyses that examined the effect of vitamin D supplementation on BW, BMI, WC, and fat mass were included. Findings of 14 meta-analyses revealed that vitamin D supplementation reduced body mass index (BMI) (ES: -0.11 kg/m<sup>2</sup>; 95% CI: -0.18, -0.05, <i>p</i>?0.001; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 61.0%, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and waist circumference (WC) (ES = -0.79 cm; 95% CI: -1.20, -0.37; <i>p</i> < 0.001; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 46.5%, <i>p</i> = 0.096) in comparison to control group. However, the effects of vitamin D on body weight (ES = -0.16 kg, 95% CI: -0.36, 0.04; <i>p</i> = 0.125; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 57.0%, <i>p</i> = 0.017), and fat mass (ES: 0.02, 95% CI: -0.20, 0.24, <i>p</i> = 0.868; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.0%, <i>p</i> = 0.531) were not considerable. Vitamin D supplementation significantly improved levels of obesity indices such as BMI, and WC.","['anthropometric indices', 'body mass index', 'obesity', 'umbrella metaanalysis', 'vitamin D']"
"Correlation of Demographics, Healthcare Availability, and COVID-19 Outcome: Indonesian Ecological Study.","<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the correlation between demographic and healthcare availability indicators with COVID-19 outcome among Indonesian provinces. <b>Methods:</b> We employed an ecological study design to study the correlation between demographics, healthcare availability, and COVID-19 indicators. Demographic and healthcare indicators were obtained from the Indonesian Health Profile of 2019 by the Ministry of Health while COVID-19 indicators were obtained from the Indonesian COVID-19 website in August 31st 2020. Non-parametric correlation and multivariate regression analyses were conducted with IBM SPSS 23.0. <b>Results:</b> We found the number of confirmed cases and case growth to be significantly correlated with demographic indicators, especially with distribution of age groups. Confirmed cases and case growth was significantly correlated (<i>p</i> < 0.05) with population density (correlation coefficient of 0.461 and 0.491) and proportion of young people (-0.377; -0.394). Incidence and incidence growth were correlated with ratios of GPs (0.426; 0.534), hospitals (0.376; 0.431), primary care clinics (0.423; 0.424), and hospital beds (0.472; 0.599) per capita. For mortality, case fatality rate (CFR) was correlated with population density (0.390) whereas mortality rate was correlated with ratio of hospital beds (0.387). Multivariate analyses found confirmed case independently associated with population density (β of 0.638) and demographic structure (-0.289). Case growth was independently associated with density (0.763). Incidence growth was independently associated with hospital bed ratio (0.486). <b>Conclusion:</b> Pre-existing inequality of healthcare availability correlates with current reported incidence and mortality rate of COVID-19. Lack of healthcare availability in some provinces may have resulted in artificially low numbers of cases being diagnosed, lower demands for COVID-19 tests, and eventually lower case-findings.","['COVID19', 'Indonesia', 'demographic', 'ecological study', 'healthcare availability']"
Effect of cooking and preservation on nutritional and phytochemical composition of the mushroom <i>Amanita zambiana</i>.,"The effect of different cooking and preservation methods on the nutritional and phytochemical composition of the mushroom, <i>Amanita zambiana</i>, was investigated. Fresh mushrooms were boiled in water, fried, or microwaved. In addition, fresh mushrooms were either air-dried for 7 days or frozen at -20°C for 14 days. The protein, lipid, carbohydrate, and phenolic content of the treated mushrooms were measured and compared to the fresh mushroom contents. Frying increased the protein (2.01% ± 0.2% [fresh mushroom] to 2.23% ± 0.09%), lipid (14.68% ± 0.9% to 15.56% ± 0.34%), and carbohydrate (0.89% ± 0.01% to 2.69% ± 0.03%) content, while microwaving increased the protein (2.01% ± 0.2% to 3.64% ± 0.08%) and carbohydrate content (0.89% ± 0.01% to 2.26% ± 0.09%). Boiling only increased the carbohydrate content (0.89% ± 0.01% to 1.71% ± 0.05%) of the mushroom and significantly decreased (<i>p</i> < .05) the phenolic content (8.77 ± 0.1 to 1.46 ± 0.2 mg gallic acid equivalent (GAE)/g mushroom). Drying resulted in significant increase (<i>p</i> < .05) in protein (2.01 ± 0.2% to 24.36 ± 0.09%), carbohydrate (0.89% ± 0.01% to 58.67% ± 3.29%), and phenolic contents (8.77 ± 0.1 to 119.8 ± 0.7 mg GAE/g mushroom), while freezing only increased the carbohydrate content (0.89% ± 0.01% to 1.77% ± 0.03%). From the three cooking methods studied, frying is recommended as the most effective cooking procedure in retaining or enhancing the mushroom nutrients, while drying is a better preservation method than freezing.","['Amanita zambiana', 'cooking', 'mushroom', 'nutrition', 'preservation']"
"Human leukocyte antigen alleles, genotypes and haplotypes frequencies in renal transplant donors and recipients from West Central India.","Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) is comprised of a highly polymorphic set of genes which determines the histocompatibility of organ transplantation. The present study was undertaken to identify HLA class I and class II allele, genotype and haplotype frequencies in renal transplant recipients and donors from West Central India.HLA typing was carried out using Polymerase Chain Reaction-Sequence Specific Primer in 552 live related and unrelated renal transplant recipients and donors.The most frequent HLA class I and class II alleles and their frequencies in recipients were HLA-AFNx0101 (0.1685) and AFNx0102 (0.1649), HLA-BFNx0135 (0.1322), and HLA-DR beta 1 (DRB 1)FNx0115 (0.2192), whereas in donors, these were HLA-AFNx0102 (0.1848) and AFNx0101 (0.1667), HLA-BFNx0135 (0.1359), and HLA-DRB1FNx0115 (0.2409). The two-locus haplotype statistical analysis revealed HLA-AFNx0102-B61 as the most common haplotype with the frequency of 0.0487 and 0.0510 in recipients and donors, respectively. Further, among the three locus haplotypes HLA-AFNx0133-BFNx0144-DRB1FNx0107 and HLA-AFNx0102-BFNx0161-DRB1FNx0115 were the most common haplotypes with frequencies 0.0362 and 0.0326, respectively in recipients and 0.0236 and 0.0323, respectively in donors. Genotype frequency revealed a high prevalence of genotype HLA-AFNx0102/AFNx0124 in recipients (0.058) compared to donors (0.0109) whereas low prevalence of HLA-AFNx0101/AFNx0102 in recipients (0.0435) than in donors (0.0797). The phylogenetic and principal component analysis of HLA allele and haplotype frequency distribution revealed genetic similarities of various ethnic groups. Further, case control analysis provides preliminary evidence of association of HLA-A genotype (P < 0.05) with renal failure.This study will be helpful in suitable donor search besides providing valuable information for population genetics and HLA disease association analysis.","['Allele', 'genotype', 'haplotype', 'human leukocyte antigens frequencies', 'polymorphism', 'renal transplant']"
Effect of Celastrus paniculatus on trace elements of cerebellum in ageing albino rats.,"In Indian traditional system of medicine Celastrus paniculatus extract has been used to improve intellect, memory and for the treatment of various mental disorders.The present study was undertaken to evaluate the effectiveness of this medicinal plant on serum biochemistry.Ethanolic extract of seed of Celastrus paniculatus (2g/kg/body weight) was orally administrated for 16 days in 20 months old albino rats. The results were compared with 3 months, 12 months and 20 months old control rats. The concentration of trace elements was determined by atomic absorption spectrophotometer.Significant variation was observed in the concentration of trace elements. In case of copper there was decrease in content in early aged (0.240 ± 0.004) control and age control (0.115 ± 0.004) rats whereas an increase in treated aged rats (0.124 ± 0.004) was observed. Non significant variation was observed in zinc content. Young control rats possessed 0.683 ± 0.004 (µg/ml) zinc contents in cerebellum. Age control animal showed the highest level of Zn 0.954 ± 0.002. Celastrus paniculatus treated rat show revealed the lowest level of zinc 0.457 ± 0.003 (µg/ml) in cerebellum. Young control rat had 0.066 ± 0 (µg/ml) manganese content which was significantly decreased in early age control (0.022 ± 0.0008) followed the significant increase in age control (0.087 ± 0.002). Treated rats possessed the decreased content than age control but higher than young and early age control. Non significant decrease in cobalt content was observed during ageing as in young control the highest cobalt content was 0.084 ± 0.0007 followed by decrease in early age control 0.83 ± 0 and age control 0.006 ± 0.0007 (µg/ml). Treated rats showed an increase in cobalt content up to 0.032 ± 0.0007.Results of the present study revealed that the determination of trace elements in blood and tissues has been widely used in the last two decades as a tool to understand their metabolic role in human and animals.","['Antioxidants', 'Brain', 'Free radicals', 'Neuron']"
Diagnostic findings caused by cutting of the iliotibial tract and anterolateral ligament in an ACL intact knee using a standardized and automated clinical knee examination.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the separate contribution of the two definitions of the anterolateral ligament (ALL), the mid-third lateral capsular ligament (MTLCL) and deep capsule-osseous layer of the iliotibial tract (dcITT) in addition to the superficial iliotibial tract (sITT) to the control of tibial motion with respect to the femur during the application of force/torque seen during the three tests of the standard clinical knee examination (AP Lachman test, tibial axial rotation test and varus-valgus stress test).Six pelvis-to-toe cadaveric specimens were examined using an automated testing device that carried out the three components of the clinical knee examination. Internal/external rotation torque, anteroposterior load and adduction/abduction torque were applied, while torque/force and positional measurements were recorded. Sequential sectioning of the structures followed the same order for each knee, sITT, dcITT and MTLCL. Testing was repeated after release of each structure.During the tibial axial rotation test, releasing the sITT caused an increase in internal rotation of 2.6° (1.4-4.1°, p < 0.0005), while release of the dcITT increased internal rotation an additional 0.8° (0.4-1.1°, p < 0.0015). Changes in secondary motions of the tibia after sITT release demonstrated an increase in anterior translation of 1.2 mm (0.6-2.0 mm, p < 0.0005) during internal rotation, while release of the dcITT increased the same motion an additional 0.4 mm (0.2-0.5 mm, p < 0.0005). During the AP Lachman test, release of the sITT caused the tibia to move more anteriorly by 0.7 mm (0.4-1.1 mm, p < 0.0005) and increased internal rotation by 2.7° (0.9-5.2°, p < 0.004). The additional release of the dcITT resulted in more anterior translation by 0.3 mm (0.1-0.4 mm, p < 0.002) and internal rotation by 0.9° (0.2-1.7°, p < 0.005). During the varus-valgus stress test, release of the sITT permitted 0.9° (0.4-1.4°, p < 0.0005) more adduction of the tibia, while the additional release of the dcITT significantly increased adduction by 0.4° (0.2°-0.5°, p < 0.001). Release of the MTLCL had a nominal but significant increase in internal rotation, 0.6° (0.1-1.1°, p < 0.0068) and external rotation, -0.1° (-0.1° to -0.2°, p < 0.0025) during the tibial axial rotation test, anterior translation of 0.2 mm (0.0-0.4 mm, p < 0.021) only during the AP Lachman test, and adduction rotation, 0.2° (0.0-0.3°, p < 0.034) only during the varus-valgus stress test.The presence of increased adduction during an automated knee examination provides unique information identifying the release of the sITT, dcITT and the MTLCL in this cadaveric study. While their sequential release caused similar pattern changes in the three components of the automated knee examination, the extent of change due to release of the MTLCL was markedly less than after release of the dcITT which was markedly less than after release of the sITT.","['Anterolateral ligament', 'Knee laxity', 'Knee ligaments', 'Ligament biomechanics']"
<i>In vivo</i> evaluation of early renal damage in type 2 diabetic patients on 3.0 T MR diffusion tensor imaging.,"To investigate the utility of renal diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to detect early renal damage in patients with type 2 diabetes.Twenty-six diabetic patients (12 with microalbuminuria (MAU), and 14 with normoalbuminuria) and fourteen healthy volunteers were prospectively included in this study. Renal DTI on 3.0 T MR was performed, and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was recorded for each subject. Mean cortical and medullary fractional anisotropy (FA) values were calculated by placing multiple representative regions of interest. Mean FA values were statistically compared among groups. Correlations between FA values and eGFR were evaluated.Both cortical and medullary FA were significantly reduced in diabetic patients compared to healthy controls (0.403 ± 0.064 <i>vs</i> 0.463 ± 0.047, <i>P</i> = 0.004, and 0.556 ± 0.084 <i>vs</i> 0.645 ± 0.076, <i>P</i> = 0.002, respectively). Cortical FA was significantly lower in diabetic patients with NAU than healthy controls (0.412 ± 0.068 <i>vs</i> 0.463 ± 0.047, <i>P</i> = 0.02). Medullary FA in diabetic patients with NAU and healthy controls were similar (0.582 ± 0.096 <i>vs</i> 0.645 ± 0.076, <i>P</i> = 0.06). Both cortical FA and medullary FA correlated with eGFR (<i>r</i> = 0.382, <i>P</i> = 0.015 and <i>r</i> = 0.552, <i>P</i> = 0.000, respectively).FA of renal parenchyma on DTI might serve as a more sensitive biomarker of early diabetic nephropathy than MAU.","['Correlation', 'Diabetic nephropathy', 'Estimated GFR', 'Fractional anisotropy', 'Microalbuminuria', 'Renal diffusion tensor imaging']"
The Effect of Long-Term Low-Dose Atropine on Refractive Progression in Myopic Australian School Children.,"Myopia will affect half the global population by 2050 and is a leading cause of vision impairment. High-dose atropine slows myopia progression but with undesirable side-effects. Low-dose atropine is an alternative. We report the effects of 0.01% or 0.005% atropine eye drops on myopia progression in 13 Australian children aged between 2 and 18 years and observed for 2 years without and up to 5 years (mean 2.8 years) with treatment. Prior to treatment, myopia progression was either 'slow' (more positive than -0.5 D/year; mean -0.19 D/year) or 'fast' (more negative than -0.5 D/year; mean -1.01 D/year). Atropine reduced myopic progression rates (slow: -0.07 D/year, fast: -0.25 D/year, combined: before: -0.74, during: -0.18 D/year, <i>p</i> = 0.03). Rebound occurred in 3/4 eyes that ceased atropine. Atropine halved axial growth in the 'Slow' group relative to an age-matched model of untreated myopes (0.098 vs. 0.196 mm/year, <i>p</i> < 0.001) but was double that in emmetropes (0.051 mm/year, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Atropine did not slow axial growth in 'fast' progressors compared to the age-matched untreated myope model (0.265 vs. 0.245 mm/year, <i>p</i> = 0.754, Power = 0.8). Adverse effects (69% of patients) included dilated pupils (6/13) more common in children with blue eyes (5/7, <i>p</i> = 0.04). Low-dose atropine could not remove initial myopia offsets suggesting treatment should commence in at-risk children as young as possible.","['001', 'Australia', 'atropine', 'eye growth', 'myopia', 'refractive error']"
"Estimates of genetic parameters for rumination time, feed efficiency, and methane production traits in first lactation Holstein cows.","The large-scale recording of traits such as feed efficiency and methane emissions for use in genetic improvement programs is complex, costly, and time-consuming. Therefore, heritable traits that can be continuously recorded in dairy herds and are correlated to feed efficiency and methane emission traits could provide useful information for genetic evaluation. Rumination time has been suggested to be associated with feed efficiency, methane production (methane emission in g/day), and production traits at the phenotypic level. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the genetic relationships among rumination time, feed efficiency, methane and production traits using 7,358 records from 656 first lactation Holstein cows. The estimated heritabilities were moderate for rumination time (0.45 ± 0.14), methane production (0.36 ± 0.12), milk yield (0.40 ± 0.08), fat yield (0.29 ± 0.06), protein yield (0.32 ± 0.07), and energy corrected milk (0.28 ± 0.07), while low and non-significant for feed efficiency (0.15 ± 0.07), which was defined as the residual of the multiple linear regression of DMI on ECM and MBW. A favorable negative genetic correlation was estimated between rumination time and methane production (-0.53 ± 0.24), while a positive favorable correlation was estimated between rumination time and energy corrected milk (0.49 ± 0.11). The estimated genetic correlation of rumination time with feed efficiency (-0.01 ± 0.17) was not significantly different from zero but showed a trend of a low correlation with dry matter intake (0.21 ± 0.13, P = 0.11). These results indicate that rumination time is genetically associated with methane production and milk production traits, but high standard errors indicate that further analyses should be conducted to verify these findings when more data for rumination time, methane production and feed efficiency become available.","['feed efficiency', 'heritability', 'methane production', 'rumination time']"
Healthy lifestyle interventions for childhood and adolescent cancer survivors: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This study investigated the effects of healthy lifestyle interventions (HLSIs) on health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) in childhood and adolescent cancer survivors (CACS).Major databases were searched for English-language original articles published between January 1, 2000 and May 2, 2021. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-RCTs were included. Quality was assessed using the revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, and a meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3 software.Nineteen studies were included. Significant effects on HR-QoL were found for interventions using a multi-modal approach (exercise and education) (d=-0.46; 95% confidence interval [CI]=-0.84 to -0.07, p=.02), lasting not less than 6 months (d=-0.72; 95% CI=-1.15 to -0.29, p=.0010), and using a group approach (d=-0.46; 95% CI=-0.85 to -0.06, p=.02). Self-efficacy showed significant effects when HLSIs provided health education only (d=-0.55; 95% CI=-0.92 to -0.18; p=.003), lasted for less than 6 months (d=-0.40; 95% CI=-0.69 to -0.11, p=.006), and were conducted individually (d=-0.55; 95% CI=-0.92 to -0.18, p=.003). The physical outcomes (physical activity, fatigue, exercise capacity-VO2, exercise capacity-upper body, body mass index) revealed no statistical significance.Areas of HLSIs for CACS requiring further study were identified, and needs and directions of research for holistic health management were suggested.","['Cancer survivors', 'Healthy lifestyle', 'Metaanalysis', 'Systematic review']"
Factors associated with therapeutic inertia in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus started on basal insulin.,"In this study we aim to identify the factors associated with treatment inertia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who have been recently started on basal insulin (BI).Using UK CPRD GOLD, we identified adults with T2DM with suboptimal glycaemia (HbA1c within 12 months of BI ≥ 7% (≥53 mmol/mol)). We used multivariable Cox regression model to describe the association between patient characteristics and the time to treatment intensification.A total of 12,556 patients were analysed. Compared to individuals aged < 65 years, those aged ≥ 65 years had lower risk of treatment intensification (HR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.64-0.73). Other factors included being female (0.93, 0.89-0.99), longer T2DM duration (0.99, 0.98-0.99), living in the most deprived areas (0.90, 0.83-0.98), being a current smoker (0.91, 0.84-0.98), having one (0.91, 0.85-0.97) or more than one comorbidity (0.88, 0.82-0.94), and patients who were on metformin (0.71, 0.63-0.80), or 2nd generation sulphonylureas (0.85; 0.79-0.92) or DPP4 inhibitors (0.87, 0.82-0.93) compared to those who were not.Therapeutic inertia still remains a major barrier, with multiple factors associated with delay in intensification. Interventions to overcome therapeutic inertia need to be implemented at both patient and health care professional level.","['Basal insulin', 'Suboptimal glycaemic level', 'Therapeutic inertia', 'Type 2 diabetes mellitus']"
The Effectiveness of Pap and Visual Inspection With Acetic Acid (VIAA) Tests in Cervical Dysplasia Screenings During the COVID-19 Pandemic.,"Objective This study was aimed at analyzing the validity and reliability of the Papanicolaou (Pap) test and visual inspection with acetic acid (VIAA) tests for cervical dysplasia screenings during the COVID-19 pandemic. Material and methods This was a retrospective study of patients 21 years or older seen at the Luis Negreiros Primary Care Center in Lima, Peru between 2020 and 2021, who underwent cervical dysplasia screening (Pap or VIAA). Relevant information regarding patient age, date of service, and Pap and VIAA results were collected. Parallel form reliability was analyzed with chi-square tests, and phi, contingency and Cramer's V coefficients. The validity of these tests was analyzed through the calculation of the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values with confidence intervals. A p-value less than 0.05 indicated statistical significance. Results From 4,503 records, the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for Pap were 0.87 (0.81-0.92), 1.0 (1.0-1.0), 1.0 (1.0-1.0) and 0.99 (0.98-0.99), respectively, and those for VIAA were 0.22 (0.14-0.31), 0.10 (0.10-0.10), 0.53 (0.38-0.69) and 0.10 (0.10-0.10), respectively. Test validity varied slightly according to patient age and the year of testing. The correlation, although significant, was inverse; chi-square = 39.18, p <0.001, phi = -0.60, contingency = 0.51 and Cramer's V = -0.59. Conclusion The validity and reliability of Pap testing and VIAA for cervical dysplasia screening significantly decreased during the COVID-19 pandemic. The correlation between these tests, although significant, was inverse. More larger-scale studies are needed to confirm these findings and understand the reasons underlying the decreased effectiveness of these tests.","['acetic acid', 'colposcopy', 'covid19', 'cytological techniques', 'early detection of cancer', 'papanicolaou test', 'sarscov2', 'sensitivity and specificity', 'uterine cervical neoplasms', 'vaginal smears']"
Hope and depression: the mediating role of social support and spiritual coping in advanced cancer patients.,"Depression is the most common mental disorder in patients with advanced cancer, which may lead to poor prognosis and low survival rate. This study aims to explore the serial multiple mediating roles of social support and spiritual coping between hope and depression among patients with advanced cancer.A cross-sectional study was conducted in China between May and August 2020. A total of 442 advanced cancer patients were investigated by the following self-reported questionnaires: Herth Hope Index (HHI), Spiritual Coping Questionnaire (SCQ, Chinese version), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).Depression was negatively correlated with hope, social support, and positive spiritual coping (P < 0.01), and positively correlated with negative spiritual coping (P < 0.01). Hope explained 16.0% of the variance in depression. Bootstrap analyses of the hope--social support--positive spiritual coping--depression showed that there were direct [B = -0.220, 95%CI(- 0.354, - 0.072)] and indirect effects of hope on depression mediated solely by social support [B = -0.122, 95%CI(- 0.200, - 0.066)] and positive spiritual coping [B = -0.112, 95%CI(- 0.217,-0.025)], or by both together [B = -0.014, 95%CI(- 0.038,-0.003)]. Similarly, the hope--social support--negative spiritual coping--depression showed that there were direct [B = -0.302, 95%CI(- 0.404, - 0.190)] and indirect effects of hope on depression mediated solely by social support [B = -0.126, 95%CI(- 0.205, - 0.071)] and negative spiritual coping [B = -0.033, 95%CI(- 0.080,-0.002)], or by both together [B = -0.010, 95%CI(- 0.030,-0.001)].This study proves the hypothesis that social support and spiritual coping play intermediary roles between hope and depression. Interventions established through hope, social support and spiritual coping can effectively prevent depression from occurring.","['Advanced cancer', 'Cope', 'Depression', 'Hope', 'Serial multiple mediation', 'Social support', 'Spirituality']"
Safety of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with inflammatory bowel disease: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Risk of adverse effects and flare of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) are frequently cited reasons for COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.Electronic databases were searched to identify studies reporting the use of COVID-19 vaccine in IBD. We selected studies reporting the incidence of various adverse effects (local or systemic) and flares of IBD after COVID-19 vaccination. The pooled incidence rates for various adverse effects, stratified for the dose and the type of vaccine (adenoviral or mRNA) were estimated.Nine studies (16 vaccination cohorts) were included. The pooled incidence rate of overall adverse events was 0.55 (95%CI, 0.45-0.64, I<sup>2</sup>= 95%). The pooled incidence rate of local adverse events was 0.64 (0.47-0.78, I<sup>2</sup>= 100%). The pooled incidence rates of fatigue, headache, myalgia, fever and chills were 0.30 (0.21-0.40, I<sup>2</sup>= 99%), 0.23 (0.17-0.30, I<sup>2</sup>= 99%), 0.18 (0.13-0.24, I<sup>2</sup>= 99%), 0.10 (0.06-0.17, I<sup>2</sup>= 98%) and 0.15 (0.06-0.3, I<sup>2</sup>= 86%), respectively. The pooled incidence rates of severe adverse events, adverse events requiring hospitalization and flares of IBD following COVID-19 vaccination were 0.02 (0.00-0.12, I<sup>2</sup>= 97%), 0.00 (0.00-0.01, I<sup>2</sup>= 27%) and 0.01 (0.01-0.03, I<sup>2</sup>= 45%), respectively.COVID-19 vaccination in patients with IBD appears to be safe with only mild adverse events. Flares of IBD and severe adverse events requiring hospitalization were infrequent.","['Crohns disease', 'SARSCoV2', 'Sideeffect', 'Ulcerative colitis']"
Circulating trace elements status in COVID-19 disease: A meta-analysis.,"Trace elements are a group of essential metals or metalloids, which are necessary for life, and present in minute amounts. Despite substantial researches highlighting the importance of trace elements in Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) diseases, a thorough evaluation of the levels of circulating trace elements is lacking. Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the trace element status (Zn, Fe, Cu, Mg, and Se) in COVID-19 disease. We also assessed the relationship between circulating trace elements and COVID-19 disease severity and survival status during follow-up. We searched comprehensively MEDLINE, Web of Science, CNKI, and WangFang databases without language restriction, between November 1, 2019 and April 1, 2022. The search identified 1,566 preliminary references. A total of 49 studies met the eligibility criteria and were included in the review, and 42 studies were included in the final meta-analysis. Meta-analysis showed that COVID-19 patients had significantly lower circulating Zn (SMD: -0.83, 95% CI: -1.19 to -0.46, <i>P</i> < 0.001), Fe (SMD: -1.56, 95% CI: -2.90 to -0.21, <i>P</i> = 0.023), and Se (SMD: -0.75, 95% CI: -0.94 to -0.56, <i>P</i> < 0.001) levels than healthy controls, and circulating Zn (SMD: -0.47, 95% CI: -0.75 to -0.18, <i>P</i> = 0.002), Fe (SMD: -0.45, 95% CI: -0.79 to -0.12, <i>P</i> = 0.008), and Se (SMD: -0.27, 95% CI: -0.49 to -0.04, <i>P</i> = 0.020) levels were associated with the presence of severity status in COVID-19 patients. Moreover, circulating Fe levels in non-survivors were significantly lower than survivors in COVID-19 (SMD: -0.28, 95% CI: -0.44 to -0.12, <i>P</i> = 0.001). However, there was no significant difference in Cu and Mg levels between COVID-19 patients and controls, severity and non-severity status, and survivors and non-survivors (all <i>P</i> > 0.05). Taken together, COVID-19 patients displayed lower circulating levels of Zn, Fe, and Se, and their levels were associated with severity status. Moreover, circulating Fe levels may provide part of the explanation for the unfavorable survival status. Therefore, we presumed optimistically that supplements of trace elements might provide an adjutant treatment in the early stages of COVID-19.[https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero], identifier [CRD42022348599].","['COVID19', 'SARSCoV2', 'metaanalysis', 'prognosis', 'serum', 'trace element']"
The effects of integrated palliative care on quality of life and psychological distress in patients with advanced cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Integrated palliative care (IPC) is regarded as the standard therapy for advanced cancer. We conduct a comprehensive analysis to evaluate current evidence for the effectiveness of IPC on quality of life (QoL) and psychological distress among patients with advanced cancer. Differences in effectiveness are explored regarding various types of IPC and the follow-up time/period.A systematic literature search of PubMed, PsycINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials was conducted. We identified 12 randomized controlled trials, which included 2,356 participants, that were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis.Our results suggested no significant difference between the three different models of IPC and conventional treatment on overall QoL (SMD =0.06, 95% CI: -0.06 to 0.17, P=0.318). However, there was a long-lasting favorable effect of IPC on overall QoL throughout the follow-up period of 12 to 18 weeks (SMD =0.13, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.24, P=0.016). The inpatient consulting model was more effective than other models in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms (SMD =-0.42, 95% CI: -0.64 to -0.19, P<0.001; SMD =-0.31, 95% CI: -0.54 to -0.09, P=0.006). In the early period of approximately 2 weeks of follow-up, IPC was shown to be significantly more effective in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms (SMD =-0.30, 95% CI: -0.52 to -0.07, P=0.009; SMD =-0.45, 95% CI: -0.68 to -0.23, P<0.001). IPC was also effective in decreasing posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (SMD =-0.46, 95% CI: -0.69 to -0.23, P<0.001).IPC can effectively improve QoL and alleviate early psychological distress in patients with advanced cancer. The inpatient consulting model of IPC was more effective than other models in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms.","['Palliative care', 'advanced cancer', 'metaanalysis', 'psychological distress', 'quality of life QoL']"
Roles of BN52021 in platelet-activating factor pathway in inflammatory MS1 cells.,"To determine the effects of BN52021 on platelet-activating factor receptor (PAFR) signaling molecules under lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory conditions in MS1 cells.MS1 cells (a mouse pancreatic islet endothelial cell line) were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mmol/L glutamine and 100 μg/mL penicillin/streptomycin in 5% CO2 at 37 °C. After growth to confluency in media, the cells were processed for subsequent studies. The MS1 cells received 0, 0.1, 1 and 10 μg/mL LPS in this experiment. The viability/proliferation of the cells induced by LPS was observed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide colorimetric assay. Apoptosis and necrosis of the cells under the inflammatory condition described previously were observed using Hoechst 33342-propidium iodide staining. Adenylate cyclase (AC), phospholipase A2 (PLA2), phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ), protein tyrosine kinase (PTK), G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK) and p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) mRNA in the PAFR signaling pathway were measured by real-time polymerase chain reaction. The protein expression level of phosphorylated AC (p-AC), phosphorylated PLA2 (p-PLA2), phosphorylated PTK (p-PTK), phosphorylated p38 MAPK (p-p38 MAPK), PLCβ and GRK was measured using Western blotting analysis.The activity of MS1 cells incubated with different concentrations of LPS for 6 h decreased significantly in the 1 μg/mL LPS group (0.49 ± 0.10 vs 0.67 ± 0.13, P < 0.05) and 10 μg/mL LPS group (0.44 ± 0.10 vs 0.67 ± 0.13, P < 0.001), but not in 0.1 μg/mL group. When the incubation time was extended to 12 h (0.33 ± 0.05, 0.32 ± 0.03 and 0.25 ± 0.03 vs 0.69 ± 0.01) and 24 h (0.31 ± 0.01, 0.29 ± 0.03 and 0.25 ± 0.01 vs 0.63 ± 0.01), MS1 cell activity decreased in all LPS concentration groups compared with the blank control (P < 0.001). BN52021 significantly improved the cell activity when its concentration reached 50 μmol/L compared with the group that received LPS treatment alone, which was consistent with the results obtained from fluorescence staining. The mRNAs levels of AC (4.02 ± 0.14 vs 1.00 ± 0.13), GRK (2.63 ± 0.03 vs 1.00 ± 0.12), p38 MAPK (3.87 ± 0.07 vs 1.00 ± 0.17), PLA2 (3.31 ± 0.12 vs 1.00 ± 0.12), PLCβ (2.09 ± 0.08 vs 1.00 ± 0.06) and PTK (1.85 ± 0.07 vs 1.00 ± 0.11) were up-regulated after LPS stimulation as compared with the blank control (P < 0.05). The up-regulated mRNAs including AC (2.35 ± 0.13 vs 3.87 ± 0.08), GRK (1.17 ± 0.14 vs 2.65 ± 0.12), p38 MAPK (1.48 ± 0.18 vs 4.30 ± 0.07), PLCβ (1.69 ± 0.10 vs 2.41 ± 0.13) and PLA2 (1.87 ± 0.11 vs 2.96 ± 0.08) were significantly suppressed by BN52021 except for that of PTK. The level of p-AC (1.11 ± 0.12 vs 0.65 ± 0.08), GRK (0.83 ± 0.07 vs 0.50 ± 0.03), PLCβ (0.83 ± 0.16 vs 0.50 ± 0.10) and p-p38 MAPK (0.74 ± 0.10 vs 0.38 ± 0.05) was up-regulated after LPS stimulation as compared with the blank control (P < 0.05). The up-regulated proteins, including p-AC (0.65 ± 0.15 vs 1.06 ± 0.14), GRK (0.47 ± 0.10 vs 0.80 ± 0.06), PLCβ (0.47 ± 0.04 vs 0.80 ± 0.19) and p-p38 MAPK (0.30 ± 0.10 vs 0.97 ± 0.05), was significantly suppressed by BN52021, but p-PLA2 and p-PTK protein level were not suppressed.BN52021 could effectively inhibit LPS-induced inflammation by down-regulating the mRNA and protein levels of AC, GRK, p38 MAPK, PLA2 and PLCβ in the PAFR signaling pathway.","['BN52021', 'Inflammation', 'Pancreatitis', 'Plateletactivating factor receptor', 'Signaling pathway']"
Multivariate analysis for various quantitative traits in wheat advanced lines.,"Genetic diversity play key role in the germplasm improvement which is directly correlated with the crop production. Various statistical techniques have been used to study diversity among different genotypes. Among these techniques multivariate is most frequently used one for the genetic association of genotypes. In the present study a total of 64 advance lines included one check cultivar were evaluated under the field conditions of Cereal Crop Research Institute, Pirsabaq Nowshera, Pakistan during September 2017. Data were recorded for nine different parameters. Multivariate analysis divided the total 64 genotypes into four groups. The first five PCs with Eigen values > 1 contributed 86.95% of the variability amongst genotypes. Characters with maximum values in PC1 were Spikelets spike<sup>-1</sup> (SPPS) (0.732), spike length (SPL) (0.722) and biological yield (BY) (0.607), PC2 comprised of 100-grain weight (TGW) (0.605), grain yield (GY) (0.482) while days to heading (DH) (0.393), for PC3 major contributors were BY (0.550) and number of tillers meter square<sup>-1</sup> (NTPS) (0.289), the contribution of PC4 were flag leaf area (FLA) (0.716) and SPL (0.298) and the maximum values for various traits in PC5 were SPPS (0.732), SPL (0.722) and BY (0.607). From the findings of present study best performing lines can be directly recommended for general cultivation or to be used in future breeding programs.","['Correlation', 'Eigen values', 'Genetic diversity', 'Multivariate analysis', 'Wheat']"
Estimation of Protein and Amino Acid Requirements in Layer Chicks Depending on Dynamic Model.,"Four trials were conducted to establish a protein and amino acid requirement model for layer chicks over 0-6 weeks by using the analytical factorization method. In trial 1, a total of 90 one-day-old Jing Tint 6 chicks with similar body weight were selected to determine the growth curve, carcass and feather protein deposition, and amino acid patterns of carcass and feather proteins. In trials 2 and 3, 24 seven-day-old and 24 thirty-five-day-old Jing Tint 6 chicks were selected to determine the protein maintenance requirements, amino acid pattern, and net protein utilization rate. In trial 4, 24 ten-day-old and 24 thirty-eight-day-old Jing Tint 6 chicks were selected to determine the standard terminal ileal digestibility of amino acids. The chicks were fed either a corn-soybean basal diet, a low nitrogen diet, or a nitrogen-free diet throughout the different trials. The Gompertz equation showed that there is a functional relationship between body weight and age, described as BWt(g) = 2669.317 × exp(-4.337 × exp(-0.019t)). Integration of the test results gave a comprehensive dynamic model equation that could accurately calculate the weekly protein and amino acid requirements of the layer chicks. By applying the model, it was found that the protein requirements for Jing Tint 6 chicks during the 6-week period were 21.15, 20.54, 18.26, 18.77, 17.79, and 16.51, respectively. The model-predicted amino acid requirements for Jing Tint 6 chicks during the 6-week period were as follows: Aspartic acid (0.992-1.284), Threonine (0.601-0.750), Serine (0.984-1.542), Glutamic acid (1.661-1.925), Glycine (0.992-1.227), Alanine (0.909-0.961), Valine (0.773-1.121), Cystine (0.843-1.347), Methionine (0.210-0.267), Isoleucine (0.590-0.715), Leucine (0.977-1.208), Tyrosine (0.362-0.504), Phenylalanine (0.584-0.786), Histidine (0.169-0.250), Lysine (0.3999-0.500), Arginine (0.824-1.147), Proline (1.114-1.684), and Tryptophan (0.063-0.098). In conclusion, this study constructed a dynamic model for the protein and amino acid requirements of Jing Tint 6 chicks during the brooding period, providing an important insight to improve precise feeding for layer chicks through this dynamic model calculation.","['Jing Tint 6', 'amino acids', 'dynamic model', 'layer chicks', 'requirements']"
Effectiveness of nontechnical skills educational interventions in the context of emergencies: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"In recent years, the importance of training healthcare professionals in nontechnical skills using effective methodologies has been increasingly recognised as a means of preventing clinical errors in the practice of health care. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of educational interventions on nontechnical skills in the emergency medical services and/or critical care unit settings.A systematic search was carried out in the PubMed, SCOPUS, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases according to predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. After the initial search, 7952 records were selected after duplicates removed. Finally, a selection of 38 studies was included for quantitative analysis. Separate meta-analyses of standardised mean changes were carried out for each outcome measure assuming a random-effects model. Cochran's Q-statistic and I<sup>2</sup> index were applied to verify study heterogeneity. Weighted analyses of variance and meta-regressions were conducted to test the influence of potential moderators and funnel plots using Duval and Tweedie's trim-and-fill method, and Egger's regression test were used to examine publication bias.All the variables analysed had a significant effect size, with the exception of situational awareness (d<sub>+</sub> = -0.448; 95% confidence interval [CI] = -1.034, 0.139). The highest mean effect size was found for knowledge (d<sub>+</sub> = -0.925; 95% CI = -1.177, -0.673), followed by the mean effect sizes for global nontechnical skills (d<sub>+</sub> = -0.642; 95% CI = -0.849, -0.434), team nontechnical skills (d<sub>+</sub> = -0.606; 95% CI = -0.949, -0.262), and leadership nontechnical skills (d<sub>+</sub> = -0.571; 95% CI = -0.877, -0.264). Similar mean effect sizes were found for attitude (d<sub>+</sub> = -0.406; 95% CI = -0.769, -0.044), self-efficacy (d<sub>+</sub> = -0.469; 95% CI = -0.874, -0.064), and communication nontechnical skills (d<sub>+</sub> = -0.458; 95% CI = -0.818, -0.099). Large heterogeneity among the standardised mean changes was found in the meta-analyses (I<sup>2</sup> > 75% and p < .001), except for self-efficacy where I<sup>2</sup> = 58.17%, and there was a nonstatistical result for Cochran's Q. This great variability is also reflected in the forest plots.The use of simulation interventions to train emergency and critical care healthcare professionals in nontechnical skills significantly improves levels of knowledge, attitude, self-efficacy, and nontechnical skills performance.","['Crisis resource management', 'Critical care', 'Emergency medicine', 'Highfidelity simulation', 'Metaanalysis', 'Nontechnical skills']"
"Socioeconomic deprivation, mortality and health of within-city migrants: a population cohort study.","Evidence linking selective migration (the situation where people in good health move from deprived to affluent areas, whilst people in poor health move in the opposite direction) within local areas to mortality is inconclusive.Mortality in within-city migrants was examined using a Sheffield population cohort, adjusted for moves to care homes. The cohort comprised 310 894 people aged 25+ years in 2001 followed up for 9.18 years, with 42 252 (13.6%) deaths. Information on pre-existing medical conditions, socioeconomic indicators and smoking was available from a sample survey.Relative risks (95% CI) of mortality in migrants from deprived to affluent areas were lower compared with people remaining in deprived areas; 0.53 (0.42 to 0.65), 0.70 (0.61 to 0.80), 0.76 (0.68 to 0.86), 0.93 (0.88 to 1.00) and 0.98 (0.93 to 1.03) in the 25-44, 45-64, 65-74, 75-84 and 85+ year age bands, respectively. They also had lower prevalence ORs (95% CI) for bronchitis (0.59 (0.39 to 0.89)), asthma (0.70 (0.53 to 0.93)), depression (0.59 (0.38 to 0.94)), and were less likely to receive benefits (0.60 (0.47 to 0.76)) and less likely to smoke (0.66 (0.51 to 0.85)).Conversely, mortality relative risks in migrants from affluent to deprived areas were higher compared with people remaining in affluent areas; 1.71 (1.37 to 2.12), 1.59 (1.40 to 1.82), 1.44 (1.26 to 1.63), 1.18 (1.10 to 1.27) and 1.04 (1.00 to 1.09) in the corresponding age groups. They also had higher prevalence odds ratios for long-term illness (2.37 (1.71 to 3.29)), asthma (1.71 (1.25 to 2.35)), diabetes (3.03 (1.70 to 5.41)), depression (2.71 (1.74 to 4.21)), were more likely to receive benefits (2.25 (1.65 to 3.07)) and more likely to smoke (1.51 (1.12 to 2.05)).People moving from deprived to affluent areas had lower mortality and better health, and vice versa, especially in the younger age groups. This study provides strong evidence linking selective migration within local areas to mortality.","['inequalities', 'migration', 'mortality']"
Factors Affecting the Success of Endodontic Microsurgery: A Cone-Beam Computed Tomography Study.,"The purpose of this retrospective study was to verify preoperative local parameters of periapical lesions evaluated on cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans as a potential prognostic factor in endodontic microsurgery (EMS). Among 89 cases, local factors (dimensions of lesion, bone destruction pattern, presence/absence of cortical bone destruction, height of buccal bone plate, apical extend of root canal filling, presence/absence of communication with anatomical cavities, type of lesion restriction) were measured on preoperative CBCT images before EMS. At least one year after surgery, the outcome of EMS was classified as a success or a failure. Ten cases (11.24%) were classified as a failure and 79 as a success (88.76%). Symptomatic lesions (OR = 0.088 (95% CI 0.011-0.731); <i>p</i> = 0.024), apicomarginal lesions (OR = 0.092 (0.021-0.402); <i>p</i> = 0.001) and an association with molar teeth (OR = 0.153 (0.032-0.732); <i>p</i> = 0.019) were found as negative predictive factors in the univariate analysis, whereas large apicocoronal dimension (OR = 0.664 (0.477-0.926); <i>p</i> = 0.016), apicomarginal lesions (OR = 0.058 (0.006-0.55); <i>p</i> = 0.013), and an association with molar teeth (OR = 0.047 (0.003-0.869); <i>p</i> = 0.04) were identified as negative predictive factors in the multivariate analysis model. Symptomatic lesions, apicomarginal lesions, lesions associated with molar teeth and large apicocoronal dimensions are significantly associated with the failure of EMS.","['conebeam computed tomography', 'endodontic microsurgery', 'periapical lesion', 'prognostic factors']"
Measurement of Human Semicircular Canal Spatial Attitude.,"Located deep in the temporal bone, the semicircular canal is a subtle structure that requires a spatial coordinate system for measurement and observation. In this study, 55 semicircular canal and eyeball models were obtained by segmentation of MRI data. The spatial coordinate system was established by taking the top of the common crus and the bottom of the eyeball as the horizontal plane. First, the plane equation was established according to the centerline of the semicircular canals. Then, according to the parameters of the plane equation, the plane normal vectors were obtained. Finally, the average unit normal vector of each semicircular canal plane was obtained by calculating the average value of the vectors. The standard normal vectors of the and left posterior semicircular canal, superior semicircular canal and lateral semicircular canal were [-0.651, 0.702, 0.287], [0.749, 0.577, 0.324], [-0.017, -0.299, 0.954], [0.660, 0.702, 0.266], [-0.739, 0.588, 0.329], [0.025, -0.279, 0.960]. The different angles for the different ways of calculating the standard normal vectors of the right and left posterior semicircular canal, superior semicircular canal and lateral semicircular canal were 0.011, 0.028, 0.008, 0.011, 0.024, and 0.006 degrees. The technology for measuring the semicircular canal spatial attitudes in this study are reliable, and the measurement results can guide vestibular function examinations and help with guiding the diagnosis and treatment of BPPV.","['human', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'measurement', 'model', 'semicircular canal', 'spatial direction']"
Preschool Asthma Symptoms in Children Born Preterm: The Relevance of Lung Function in Infancy.,"<b>Background:</b> The aim of the study is to assess whether lung function of infants born preterm predicts wheezing in pre-school age. <b>Methods:</b> A survey of the core wheezing questionnaire of the International Study on Asthma and Allergy in Children was administered to parents of preterm newborns, to whom lung function tests were performed at a corrected age of six months, and who, at the time of the survey, were between three and nine years of age. <b>Results:</b> Low values of all lung function parameters measured, except FVC, were predictors of wheezing at some time in life, (FEV0.5 OR: 0.62 (95%CI 0.39; 0.995); FEV0.5/FVC OR: 0.73 (0.54; 0.99)) FEF75 OR: 0.60 [0.37; 0.93]; FEF25-75 OR: 0.57 (0.37; 0.89)); and of wheezing in the past year (FEV0.5 OR: 0.36 (0.17; 0.76); FEV0.5/FVC OR: 0.59 (0.38; 0.93); FEF75 OR: 0.38 [0.19; 0.76]; FEF25-75 OR: 0.35 (0.17; 0.70). In addition, FEV0.5/FVC values lower than the lowest limit of normality, were predictive of hospital admissions due to wheezing (OR: 3.07; (1.02; 9.25)). <b>Conclusions:</b> Limited lung function in infancy is predictive of both future wheezing and hospitalization for a wheezing episode.","['infant lung function', 'preschool asthma', 'preterm newborn']"
"Gender Patterns in Immigrants' Health Profiles in France: Tobacco, Alcohol, Obesity and Self-Reported Health.","<i>Background:</i> to date, little attention has been given to gender differences in the health of migrants relative to native-born. In this study, we examine the health profile of the largest immigrant groups in metropolitan France, considering several health indicators and with a special interest in the gendered patterns. <i>Methods</i>: The data originate from the 2017 Health Barometer survey representative of metropolitan France. A subsample of 19,857 individuals aged 18-70 years was analysed using modified Poisson regression, and risk ratio estimates (RR) were provided for the different migrant groups regarding alcohol use, current smoking, obesity and less-than-good self-reported health, adjusting for age and educational level. <i>Results</i>: None of the groups of male migrants differs from the native-born in terms of self-reported health, and they have healthier behaviours for alcohol (men from sub-Saharan Africa: 0.42 (0.29-0.61)) and from the Maghreb: 0.30 (0.1-0.54)) and smoking (men from sub-Saharan Africa: 0.64 (0.4-0.84)), with less frequent obesity (men from the Maghreb: 0.61 (0.3-0.95)). The latter, however, more frequently report current smoking (1.21 (1.0-1.46)). For women, less-than-good health is more frequently reported by the groups from sub-Saharan Africa (1.42 (1.1-1.75)) and from the Maghreb (1.55 (1.3-1.84)). Healthier behaviours were found for alcohol (women from overseas <i>départements</i>: 0.38 (0.1-0.85)) and from the Maghreb: (0.18 (0.0-0.57)) and current smoking (women from southern Europe: 0.68 (0.4-0.97), from sub-Saharan Africa: 0.23 (0.1-0.38) and from the Maghreb: 0.42 (0.2-0.61)). Conversely, some were more frequently obese (women from overseas <i>départements</i>: 1.79 (1.2-2.56) and from sub-Saharan Africa: 1.67 (1.2-2.23)). In the latter two groups from Africa, there is a larger relative male excess for tobacco than in the native-born (male-to-female ratios of respectively 2.87 (1.6-5.09) and 3.1 (2.0-4.65) vs 1.13 (1.0-1.20)) and there is a female excess for obesity (0.51 (0.2-0.89) and 0.41 (0.2-0.67)) in contrast with the native-born (1.07 (0.9-1.16)). The female disadvantage in terms of less-than-good self-reported health is more pronounced among migrants from the Maghreb than among the natives (0.56(0.4-0.46) vs. 0.86 (0.8-0.91)). <i>Conclusion</i>: Considering a set of four health indicators, we provide evidence for distinctive gender patterns among immigrants in France. Male immigrants have a healthy behavioural profile in comparison with the natives and no health disadvantage. Female immigrants have a more mixed profile, with a health disadvantage for the non-Western groups from Africa. The contribution to this discordance of socioeconomic factors and gender relations needs to be investigated.","['France', 'alcohol', 'gender', 'immigrants', 'obesity', 'selfreported health', 'smoking']"
N terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide is associated with improved heart rate recovery after treadmill exercise test.,"Heart rate recovery (HRR) and N terminal-pro B type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are markers for survival and cardiac function; however, Little is known about their association.We examined 2540 healthy subjects aged 12-49 years with data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey(NHANES) 1999-2002. HRR parameters 1-3 min after exercise were calculated from exercise test results. Baseline characteristics, anthropometric and NT-proBNP, and other risk covariates were obtained.The results showed that NT-proBNP was positively correlated with HRR2(correlation coefficient (cc) = 0.042 [0.029-0.054], P < 0.001) and HRR3(cc = 0.046 [0.029-0.064], P = 0.001); with further adjustment, the associations remained significant between NT-proBNP and HRR2(cc = 0.030 [0.010-0.049], P = 0.004)/HRR3(cc = 0.029[0.004-0.054], P = 0.025). Our study also found significant correlations between NT-pro BNP and SBP(cc = -0.026 [-0.046∼-0.005], P = 0.017), DBP(cc = -0.037 [-0.062∼-0.012], P = 0.005), and total cholesterol(cc = -0.065 [-0.12∼-0.018], P = 0.009).Our results suggest that BNP might reduce heart rate after exercise by inhibiting the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), reducing HRR2 and HRR3, as these phases involve the reduction of heart rate through cardiac sympathetic withdrawal. Moreover, the interaction of BNP on the SNS might be related to the effect of BNP on cardiovascular risks.","['Brain natriuretic peptide', 'Heart rate recovery', 'N terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide']"
Multifocal versus modified monovision corrections: A non-dispensing comparison of visual assessment in presbyopic neophytes.,"To compare the visual performance of two simultaneous-vision soft multifocal contact lenses and to compare multifocal contact lens and its modified monovision counterpart in presbyopic neophytes.A double-masked, prospective, comparative study was conducted on 19 participants fitted with soft PureVision2 multifocal (PVMF) and clariti multifocal (CMF) lenses in random order. High- and low-contrast distance visual acuity, near visual acuity, stereopsis, contrast sensitivity, and glare acuity were measured. The measurements were conducted using multifocal and modified monovision design with one brand and then repeated with another brand of lens.High-contrast distance visual acuity showed a significant difference between CMF (0.00 [-0.10-0.04]) and PureVision2 modified monovision (PVMMV; -0.10 [-0.14-0.00]) correction (P = 0.003) and also between CMF and clariti modified monovision (CMMV; -0.10 [-0.20-0.00]) correction (P = 0.002). Both modified monovision lenses outperformed CMF. The current study did not show any statistically significant difference between contact lens corrections for low-contrast visual acuity, near visual acuity, and contrast sensitivity (P > 0.01). Stereopsis at near distance was significantly lower with both modified monovision (PVMMV: 70 [50-85]; P = 0.007, CMMV: 70 [70-100]; P = 0.006) and with CMF (50 [40-70]; P = 0.005) when compared to spectacles (50 [30-70]). Glare acuity was significantly lower with multifocal (PVMF: 0.46 [0.40-0.50]; P = 0.001, CMF: 0.40 [0.40-0.46]; P = 0.007) compared with spectacles (0.40 [0.30-0.40]), but no significant difference was noted between the multifocal contact lenses (P = 0.033).Modified monovision provided superior high-contrast vision compared to multifocal correction. Multifocal corrections performed better for stereopsis when compared to modified monovision. In parameters like low-contrast visual acuity, near acuity, and contrast sensitivity, both the corrections performed similarly. Both multifocal designs showed comparable visual performances.","['Contrast sensitivity', 'modified monovision', 'multifocal contact lens', 'presbyopia', 'stereopsis']"
Accuracy of tooth-implant impressions: Comparison of five different techniques.,"To compare the accuracy of five different tooth-implant impression techniques.In this in vitro, experimental study, an acrylic model containing one bone-level Straumann dental implant at the site of maxillary first molar and an adjacent second premolar prepared for a porcelain fused to metal restoration was used. Impressions were made from the model using five different one-step tooth-implant impression techniques including scanning with an intraoral scanner, occlusal matrix, wax relief, closed-tray, and open-tray techniques. Each technique was repeated 15 times. The impressions were poured with dental stone, and the obtained casts were scanned by a laboratory scanner. The scan file of each technique was compared with the scan file of the original acrylic model by Geomagic Design X software. Data were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance, and Tamhane's post-hoc test (α = 0.05).For dental implant, intraoral scanning had the highest accuracy (0.1004 mm<sup>2</sup> ) followed by open-tray (0.1914 mm<sup>2</sup> ), occlusal matrix (0.2101 mm<sup>2</sup> ), closed-tray (0.2422 mm<sup>2</sup> ), and wax relief (0.2585 mm<sup>2</sup> ) techniques (p < 0.05). For the prepared tooth, wax relief (0.0988 mm<sup>2</sup> ) had the highest accuracy followed by occlusal matrix (0.1211 mm<sup>2</sup> ), open-tray (0.1663 mm<sup>2</sup> ), closed-tray (0.1737 mm<sup>2</sup> ), and intraoral scanning (0.4903 mm<sup>2</sup> ) technique (p < 0.05).

The Relationship Between Suicidal Ideation and Parental Attachment Among Adolescents: The Mediator of Anhedonia and Peer Attachment.,"<b>Background:</b> Previous studies had shown that poor quality of early parental attachment is a risk factor for suicide, but few have focus on the mechanism between suicidal ideation and parental attachment. The aim of this study was to explore how parental attachment, anhedonia, and peer attachment were associated with suicidal ideation in adolescents. <b>Method:</b> Participants were enrolled in middle schools, in Hefei, Anhui, China. All participants completed socio-demographic characteristic and standard assessments on parental attachment, peer attachment, anhedonia, and suicidal ideation by paper surveys. The effect of parental attachment on suicidal ideation mediated by anhedonia and peer attachment was analyzed by a structural equation model (SEM) using SPSS AMOS 23.0. <b>Results:</b> The SEM analysis revealed that the standard total effect of parental attachment on suicidal ideation was -0.137 (<i>Z</i>=-27.00, 95% confidence interval [CI; -0.147, -0.127], <i>p</i><0.001), with a direct effect of parental attachment on suicidal ideation of -0.107 (<i>Z</i>=-21.40, 95% CI [-0.117, -0.098], <i>p</i><0.001), while the indirect effects were-0.002 (<i>Z</i>=-3.33, 95% CI [-0.003, -0.002], <i>p</i><0.001) in the pathway of parental attachment-anhedonia-peer attachment-suicidal ideation, -0.019 (<i>Z</i>=-19.00, 95%CI [-0.022, -0.017], <i>p</i><0.001) in the pathway of parental attachment-anhedonia-suicidal ideation, and-0.008 (<i>Z</i>=-7.00, 95% CI [-0.010, -0.007], <i>p</i><0.001) in the pathway of parental attachment-peer attachment-suicidal ideation. <b>Conclusion:</b> The study suggested that parental attachment could directly influence suicidal ideation and indirectly influence suicidal ideation via anhedonia and peer attachment. The results emphasized the importance of attachment in infancy and verified the feasibility of intervention on anhedonia and peer attachment to prevent suicidal ideation.","['anhedonia', 'parental attachment', 'peer attachment', 'structural equation model', 'suicidal ideation']"
Relationship of Absolute and Relative Lower-Body Strength to Predictors of Athletic Performance in Collegiate Women Soccer Players.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between absolute and relative lower-body strength on predictors of athletic performance among Division II collegiate women's soccer players. Archived pre-season testing data for seventeen (<i>n</i> = 17) female National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) Division II soccer players were analyzed, including: vertical jump, 3RM back squat, 505-agility, modified T-test, 10 m and 30 m sprint, and 20 m multistage fitness test (20 m MSFT). Relative strength was calculated based on the estimated 1RM back squat divided by the athlete's body mass. Significant correlations were discovered between absolute lower-body strength and 505-agility (Right: <i>r</i> = -0.51, <i>p</i> < 0.05; Left: <i>r</i> = -0.59, <i>p</i> < 0.05), modified T-test (<i>r</i> = -0.55, <i>p</i> < 0.05), 10 m and 30 m (<i>r</i> = -0.59, <i>p</i> < 0.05; <i>r</i> = -0.54, <i>p</i> < 0.05), and sprint performance. Relative lower-body strength showed significant correlations with vertical jump (<i>r</i> = 0.54, <i>p</i> < 0.05), 505-agility (Right: <i>r</i> = -0.58, <i>p</i> < 0.05; Left: <i>r</i> = -0.67, <i>p</i> < 0.01), modified T-test (<i>r</i> = -0.75, <i>p</i> < 0.01), 10 m and 30 m (<i>r</i> = -0.59 <i>p</i> < 0.05; <i>r</i> = -0.67, <i>p</i> < 0.01), and the 20 m MSFT (<i>r</i> = 0.58, <i>p</i> < 0.05). These results indicate that strength and conditioning coaches should emphasize the development of absolute and relative lower-body strength with their players to improve power, agility, and speed performance.","['agility', 'change of direction speed', 'maximum strength', 'power', 'speed', 'testing']"
The consistency of antibiotic resistance' results in two methods of disk diffusion and MIC in isolated organisms from patients with urinary tract infections.,"<b>Introduction:</b> The urinary tract infection is the most common infection and drug resistance to it is increasing. Due to the acute infection, the prescribing of medicine is conducted before culture and antibiogram and according to the results, disk diffusion is adjusted. The aim of this study was to compare it with MIC to determine to what extent the current method could be useful. <b>Methods:</b> This descriptive cross-sectional investigation research regarding drug resistance was conducted with the help of two methods of disk diffusion and MIC on the isolations of patients' urine culture with UTI (midstream clean catch). Bacterial resistance was measured, and sensitivity and specificity were evaluated. <b>Results:</b> The MIC method was considered the gold standard and, according to the related formula, the sensitivity and specificity of disk diffusion were related to 13 antibiotics obtained as it follows: ciprofloxacin 69% and 69.1% (0.0001 > p and Kappa = .292), cotrimoxazole 50% and 77.3% (p = 0.010), nitrofurantoin 84.7% and 58.2% (0.0001 > p and Kappa = 0.44), ampicilin 83.3% and 85.3% (0.0001 > p and Kappa = 0.33), ofloxacin 65.5% and 83.9% (0.0001 > p and Kappa = 0.429), cephalexin 46.2% and 75.2% (p = 0.012 and Kappa = 0.116), gentamicin 64.2% and 66% (0.0001 > p and Kappa = 0.276), ceftriaxone 27.6% and 80.9% (p = 0.216 and Kappa = 0.074), nalidixic acid 42.1% and 89.2% (0.0001 > p and Kappa = 0.354), imipenem 63.4% and 70.4% (0.0001 > p and Kappa 0.306), co-amoxiclav 83% and 71% (0.0001 > p and Kappa = 0.412), cefixime 21% and 80.9% (0.0001 > p and Kappa = 0.412), vancomycin 55.9% and 94.7 (0.9001 > p and Kappa = 0.532). Sensitivity and specificity of this method were reported to be lower than MIC. <b>Conclusions:</b> Due to the low sensitivity and specificity of the disk diffusion method, antibiotic therapy should be certainly considered in clinical conditions, and risk factors for the infection and only by this approach cannot prescribe the drug.","['disk diffusion', 'drug resistance', 'minimum inhibitory concentration', 'urinary tract infection']"
"Interlinking alcohol intake, mental stress, psychotic experiences and job performance of higher institutions' graduates: A structural equation modelling.","Graduates' job performance has become a matter that needs urgent attention. This is because many stakeholders are increasingly becoming interested in understanding the extent schools are able to produce output that meets the yearnings of society. Along these lines, we examined the contributions of alcohol intake to the job performance of higher education graduates while treating mental stress and psychotic experiences as mediators in the nexus.The study's population comprised all the graduates of higher education institutions in Nigeria between 2015 and 2020. Data were collected from a virtual cross-section of 3,862 graduates who self-reported to have taken alcohol in the past. These participants responded to an electronic questionnaire that was mailed to them. The scale content validity for clarity and relevance were 0.90 and 0.88, respectively, while the Cronbach alpha reliability estimate of the instrument is 0.86.Amongst many others, key findings indicate that alcohol intake, mental stress and psychotic experiences jointly made a significant negative contribution to the overall job performance of graduates (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.256, 95% confidence interval (CI) [0.23, 0.28], <i>P</i> = 0.00). Mental stress (<i>B</i> = -0.09, <i>β</i> = -0.14, <i>z</i> = -4.45, 95%CI [-0.24, -0.05], <i>P</i> = 0.00) and psychotic experiences (<i>B</i> = -0.26, <i>β</i> = -0.43, <i>z</i> = -8.07, 95%CI [-0.68, -0.16], <i>P</i> = 0.01) have significant negative contributions to graduates' job performance, respectively. Alcohol intake and mental stress jointly predict the psychotic experiences of graduates (<i>B</i> = -0.26, <i>β</i> = -0.43, <i>z</i> = -8.07, 95%CI [-0.68, -0.16], <i>P</i> = 0.01). Alcohol intake has a positive contribution to the mental stress of graduates (<i>R</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0.797, 95%CI [0.77, 0.825], <i>P</i> = 0.01). Mental stress and psychotic experiences jointly mediated the relationship between alcohol intake and graduates' job performance.It was concluded that high intake of alcohol and high levels of mental stress and psychotic experiences significantly reduce graduates' job performance generally and in specific aspects. Alcohol intake can increase graduates' job performance to a small extent depending on the amount consumed.","['Alcohol', 'experiences', 'job performance', 'mental stress', 'psychosis']"
Risk of Abdominal Obesity Associated with Phthalate Exposure of Nurses.,"Background: Occupational health hazards associated with phthalate exposure among nurses are still not well understood. Methods: We used high-performance liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry to analyze phthalates. Anthropometric measurements and questionnaires were conducted. Results: We observed associations between mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) and body mass index (BMI), hip circumference (HC), waist circumference (WC), waist to height ratio (WHtR), and fat mass index (FMI), visceral fat content, BMI risk and hip index risk (HIrisk), adjusted to consumer behavior and consumer practices (r = 0.36−0.61; p ≤ 0.046). In the same model, we detected an association between mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) and waist to hip ratio (WHR; r = 0.36; p = 0.046), mono-carboxy-isononyl phthalate (cx-MiNP) and BMI (r = 0.37; p = 0.043), HC (r = 0.4; p = 0.026) and WHtR (r = 0.38; p = 0.037), between mono-oxo-isononyl phthalate oxo (MiNP) and HC (r = 0.36; p = 0.045), mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP), mono(2-ethyl-5-oxohexyl) phthalate (oxo-MEHP) and HIrisk (r = 0.38−0.41; p ≤ 0.036), between oxo-MEHP and Anthropometric Risk Index (ARI risk; r = 0.4; p = 0.028). We detected a relationship between BMI and MBzP (β = 0.655; p < 0.001) and mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP; β = −0.365; p = 0.003), between hip circumference and MBzP (β = 0.486; p < 0.001), MEHP (β = −0.402; p = 0.001), and sum of secondary metabolites of diisononyl phthalate (∑DiNP; β = 0.307; p = 0.016). We observed a relationship between fat content and MBzP (β = 0.302; p = 0.033), OH-MnBP (β = −0.736; p = 0.006) and MiBP (β = 0.547; p = 0.046), visceral fat content and MBzP (β = 0.307; p = 0.030), HI-risk and MBzP (β = 0.444; p = 0.001), ARI-risk and sum of di-n-butyl phthalate metabolites (∑DnBP; β = 0.337; p = 0.018). We observed an association between the use of protective equipment with cx-MiNP. Conclusions: Occupational exposure to phthalates may induce abdominal obesity and result in obesity-related metabolic disorders.","['health risk', 'nurses', 'obesogenic effect', 'occupational exposure', 'phthalates']"
Relationship between environmental factors and responsive behaviours in long-term care homes: a secondary data analysis.,"Responsive behaviours (eg, wandering, resisting care and verbal abuse) are a continuing issue for staff and individuals living in long-term care (LTC) homes. The LTC environment can influence responsive behaviours and is a factor in determining the quality of life for those living there. The ways in which the quality of the environment might influence responsive behaviours has not been investigated yet. We hypothesised that better quality environments would be associated with reduced rates of responsive behaviours. We used a tool that simultaneously encompasses human and structural elements of the environment, a novel approach in this field of research.Cross-sectional study, using data collected from September 2014 to May 2015 as part of the Translating Research in Elder Care research programme.A representative, stratified (size, owner-operator model and health region) random sample of 76 LTC homes in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba.13 224 individuals (67.3% females) living in participating LTC homes.Quality of care unit work environment was assessed using the observable indicators of quality (OIQ) tool. Responsive behaviours were assessed using routinely collected Resident Assessment Instrument-Minimum Data Set V.2.0 data.Adjusted regression coefficients of overall Aggressive Behaviour Scale score and interpersonal communication were 0.02 (95% CI -0.011 to 0.045), grooming 0.06 (95% CI -0.032 to 0.157), environment-basics 0.067 (95% CI 0.024 to 0.110), odour -0.066 (95% CI -0.137 to -0.004), care delivery -0.007 (95% CI -0.033 to 0.019), environment-access -0.027 (95% CI -0.062 to 0.007), environment-homelike -0.034 (95% CI -0.065 to -0.002) and total OIQ score 0.003 (95% CI -0.004 to 0.010).We found small associations between the environmental quality and responsive behaviours in Western Canadian LTC homes. Higher scores on homelikeness were associated with decreased responsive behaviours. Higher scores on basic environmental quality were associated with increased responsive behaviours.","['dementia', 'geriatric medicine', 'quality in health care']"
Genetic relationship among somatic cell score and some milking traits in Holstein-Friesian primiparous cows milked by an automated milking system.,"The automated milking system provides breeders with a large amount of automatically collected information about each cow in herd that cannot be easily obtained in non-robotised systems. This knowledge can be used in breeding programs improving somatic cell count (SCC) level. The objective of this study was to estimate heritabilities and genetic correlations among test-day (TD) somatic cell score (SCS) and selected milking traits, such as daily milk yield (MY), milking frequency (MF), milking time (MT) and milking speed (MS), attachment time (AT) to single teat cups, electrical conductivity (EC) and milk temperature (MTEMP). Data were collected for 1899 Polish Holstein-Friesian primiparous cows milked in an automatic milking system. Genetic parameters of the studied traits were estimated using Bayesian method via Gibbs sampling and two-trait random regression animal model with fixed effect of herd x TD, fixed regressions on days in milk (DIM) nested within age at calving by season of calving and RR for additive genetic and permanent environmental effects. Both fixed and RR were fitted with fourth-order Legendre polynomials on DIM. The estimated daily heritabilities were in the following ranges: MY - 0.162-0.338, MF - 0.156-0.444, MT - 0.090-0.320, MS - 0.252-0.665, AT - 0.105-0.394, EC - 0.269-0.466, MTEMP - 0.135-0.304 and SCS - 0.155-0.321. The heritabilities for traits expressed on a 305-d basis were moderate to high: 0.460 for MY, 0.514 for MF, 0.315 for MT, 0.431 for MS, 0.256 for AT, 0.386 for EC, 0.407 for MTEMP and 0.359 for SCS. Genetic correlations between traits on a 305-d basis showed that SCS was most strongly genetically correlated with MTEMP (0.572) and MS (0.480), whereas genetic relationships of SCS with MT (0.221) and EC (-0.216) were moderate. Phenotypic correlations between traits on a 305-d basis were moderate or low. Somatic cell score was negatively phenotypically correlated with MY, MF and MT, with the highest relationship with MT (-0.302). The largest positive phenotypic correlations were observed between SCS and MS (0.311) and with MTEMP (0.286). In summary, it is concluded that there is a chance to carry out effective selection for lower SCS and for some other traits, in particular MS and MTEMP. The obtained results are promising enough to conduct further research to evaluate how these traits can be used both to increase the accuracy of genetic evaluations of SCC and to improve udder health.","['Correlations', 'Heritability', 'Milk', 'Parameters', 'Robots']"
Meaning in Life Mediates Between Emotional Deregulation and Eating Disorders Psychopathology: A Research From the Meaning-Making Model of Eating Disorders.,"Emotional dysregulation, age, gender, and obesity are transdiagnostic risk factors for the development and maintenance of eating disorders (EDs). Previous studies found that patients with ED had less meaning in life than the non-clinical population, and that meaning in life acted as a buffer in the course of ED; however, to the data, there are no studies about the mediator role of meaning in life in association between the emotional dysregulation and the ED psychopathology. <b>Objective:</b> To analyze the mediating role of meaning in life in the relationship between emotional dysregulation and the ED psychopathology in three samples with diverse risk factors for ED. <b>Method:</b> Sample 1, <i>n</i> = 153 undergraduate young women; sample 2, <i>n</i> = 122 participants with obesity; and sample 3, <i>n</i> = 292 participants with ED. Multiple mediation analysis was performed. <b>Results:</b> Sample 1: meaning in life showed a mediation effect between emotional dysregulation and the ED psychopathology (direct effect β = 0.390, <i>p</i> < 0.05) (indirect effect β = 0.227, <i>p</i> < 0.05), body satisfaction (direct effect β = -0.017, <i>p</i> < 0.05) (indirect effect β = -0.013, <i>p</i> < 0.01), and depression symptoms (direct effect β = 1.112, <i>p</i> < 0.001) (indirect effect β = 0.414, <i>p</i> < 0.001); sample 2: meaning in life showed a mediation effect between emotional dysregulation and binge eating and purging behaviors (direct effect β = 0.194, <i>p</i> < 0.01) (indirect effect β = 0.054, <i>p</i> < 0.05) and depression symptoms (direct effect β = 0.357, <i>p</i> < 0.001) (indirect effect β = 0.063, <i>p</i> < 0.05); sample 3: meaning in life showed a mediation effect between emotional dysregulation and the ED psychopathology (direct effect β = 0.884, <i>p</i> < 0.001) (indirect effect β = 0.252, <i>p</i> < 0.007), body satisfaction (direct effect β = -0.033, <i>p</i> < 0.05) (indirect effect β = -0.021, <i>p</i> < 0.001), borderline symptoms (direct effect β = 0.040, <i>p</i> < 0.001) (indirect effect β = 0.025, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and hopelessness (direct effect β = 0.211, <i>p</i> < 0.001) (indirect effect β = 0.087, <i>p</i> < 0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> These studies suggest the importance of considering meaning in life as a variable in the onset and maintenance of ED.","['eating disorders', 'emotional deregulation', 'meaning in life', 'meaningmaking model', 'obesity', 'young women']"
Efficacy of pentoxifylline treatment for neonatal sepsis: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies.,"Pentoxifylline may be an important approach to treat neonatal sepsis. However, its use has not been well established. We conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of pentoxifylline treatment for neonatal sepsis.PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials are searched. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the influence of pentoxifylline treatment on neonatal sepsis are included. Two investigators independently have searched articles, extracted data, and assessed the quality of included studies. This meta-analysis is performed using the random-effect model.Seven RCTs involving 439 patients are included in the meta-analysis. Compared with control intervention for neonatal sepsis, pentoxifylline treatment is associated with reduced hospital stay (Std. MD = -0.61; 95% CI = -0.93 to - 0.29; P = 0.0002) and metabolic acidosis (RR = 0.38; 95% CI = 0.22 to 0.66; P = 0.0006), but has no remarkable impact on mortality (RR = 0.59; 95% CI = 0.30 to 1.16; P = 0.13), serum TNF-α (Std. MD = -0.38; 95% CI = -1.29 to 0.52; P = 0.41), serum CRP (Std. MD = -0.25; 95% CI = -0.92 to 0.42; P = 0.47), plasma IL-6 (Std. MD = -0.13; 95% CI = -0.41 to 0.15; P = 0.37), disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (RR = 0.55; 95% CI = 0.25 to 1.21; P = 0.14), and oliguria/anuria (RR = 0.77; 95% CI = 0.28 to 2.16; P = 0.62). In addition, pentoxifylline treatment can significantly reduce mortality (RR = 0.50; 95% CI = 0.29 to 0.88; P = 0.02) after excluding the study conducted by Akdag during the sensivity analysis.Pentoxifylline treatment may be associated with reduced mortality and hospital stay in neonatal sepsis.","['Metaanalysis', 'Mortality', 'Neonatal sepsis', 'Pentoxifylline', 'Randomized controlled trials']"
Effectiveness of Colorectal Cancer (CRC) Screening on All-Cause and CRC-Specific Mortality Reduction: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"(1) Background: The aim of this study was to pool and compare all-cause and colorectal cancer (CRC) specific mortality reduction of CRC screening in randomized control trials (RCTs) and simulation models, and to determine factors that influence screening effectiveness. (2) Methods: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane library were searched for eligible studies. Multi-use simulation models or RCTs that compared the mortality of CRC screening with no screening in general population were included. CRC-specific and all-cause mortality rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated by a bivariate random model. (3) Results: 10 RCTs and 47 model studies were retrieved. The pooled CRC-specific mortality rate ratios in RCTs were 0.88 (0.80, 0.96) and 0.76 (0.68, 0.84) for guaiac-based fecal occult blood tests (gFOBT) and single flexible sigmoidoscopy (FS) screening, respectively. For the model studies, the rate ratios were 0.45 (0.39, 0.51) for biennial fecal immunochemical tests (FIT), 0.31 (0.28, 0.34) for biennial gFOBT, 0.61 (0.53, 0.72) for single FS, 0.27 (0.21, 0.35) for 10-yearly colonoscopy, and 0.35 (0.29, 0.42) for 5-yearly FS. The CRC-specific mortality reduction of gFOBT increased with higher adherence in both studies (RCT: 0.78 (0.68, 0.89) vs. 0.92 (0.87, 0.98), model: 0.30 (0.28, 0.33) vs. 0.92 (0.51, 1.63)). Model studies showed a 0.62-1.1% all-cause mortality reduction with single FS screening. (4) Conclusions: Based on RCTs and model studies, biennial FIT/gFOBT, single and 5-yearly FS, and 10-yearly colonoscopy screening significantly reduces CRC-specific mortality. The model estimates are much higher than in RCTs, because the simulated biennial gFOBT assumes higher adherence. The effectiveness of screening increases at younger screening initiation ages and higher adherences.","['colorectal cancer', 'metaanalysis', 'mortality reduction', 'randomized control trials', 'screening', 'simulation models']"
Older American Women May Especially Benefit from Distributing and Consuming Protein for Decreasing Odds of Functional Limitations.,"Protein is a key macronutrient for preserving physical function, but the role of protein intake on functional status may differ in men and women. We sought to examine the associations of daily protein intake and distribution on functional limitations in older American men and women.Cross-sectional.Population-based survey.The analytic sample included 3,976 men and 4,081 women aged ≥60-years from the 2007-2016 waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.Participants reported their ability to perform basic activities of daily living, instrumental activities of daily living, leisure and social activities, lower extremity mobility activities, and general physical tasks. Those reporting difficulty or an inability in completing such functional tasks were considered as having a functional limitation. Protein intake was determined with dietary recalls and participants revealed functional limitations. Protein recommendations of ≥0.80, ≥1.00, and ≥1.50 g/kg/day were used. Based on these cut-points, we also investigated distribution of protein across 4 eating occasions at ≥0.20, ≥0.25, and ≥0.38 g/kg/meal, respectively.Older women meeting each recommendation had decreased odds for functional limitations: 0.55 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.40-0.75) for ≥0.80 g/kg/day, 0.75 (CI: 0.58-0.97) for ≥1.00 g/kg/day, and 0.72 (CI: 0.55-0.94) for ≥1.5 g/kg/day. No significant associations were observed in older men. Further, older women with protein consumption ≥0.20 g/kg/meal had decreased odds for functional limitations: 0.24 (CI: 0.10-0.61) for 1 occasion, 0.20 (CI: 0.08-0.49) for 2 occasions, 0.16 (CI: 0.07-0.40) for 3 occasions, and 0.12 (CI: 0.04-0.32) for 4 occasions. A similar trend was observed for intake ≥0.25 g/kg/meal: 0.31 (CI: 0.16-0.62) for 2 occasions, 0.30 (CI: 0.14-0.61) for 3 occasions, and 0.31 (CI: 0.12-0.78) for 4 occasions. Women with 1 and 2 eating occasions at ≥0.38 g/kg/meal of protein had 0.66 (CI: 0.48-0.91) and 0.54 (CI: 0.37-0.79) decreased odds for functional limitations, respectively.Trials that are powered to detect the effects of protein on functional status in women will help to establish causality.","['Diet', 'geriatrics', 'nutritional sciences', 'sex characteristics']"
Is thyroid autoimmunity itself associated with psychological well-being in euthyroid Hashimoto's thyroiditis?,"Recent studies imply that euthyroid Hashimoto's thyroiditis (HT) might be related with impaired HRQoL, depression and anxiety. Ninety three patients with euthyroid HT and 31 age- and gender-matched euthyroid control subjects were enrolled into this study. SF-36 questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory tests were used for evaluating HRQoL, depression and anxiety. Beck Depression Inventory scores were higher in patients with HT compared to control subjects (7.5 (4.0-14.75) vs. 5.0 (2.25-9.0), p=0.008). Beck Anxiety Questionnaire scores were also higher in patients with HT than controls (9.50 (5.0-17.0) vs. 5.0 (2.0-11.75), p=0.021). In SF-36 questionnaire; physical functioning (26.0 (20.0-28.0) vs. 29.0 (26.0-30.0), p=0.038), general health (16.4 (13.4-20.4) vs. 19.4 (16.3-21.2), p=0.026) and mental health (20.5 (16.0-23.0) vs. 23.0 (21.0-25.0), p=0.001) scores were lower in patients with HT than control subjects. There were no significant differences between patients with HT under levothyroxine replacement therapy compared to those without therapy in terms of depression and anxiety scores and components of SF-36 questionnaire. Beck Depression Inventory scores were positively correlated with TSH (r=0.250, p=0.01). In SF-36, role physical (r=0.192, p<0.05) and vitality (r=0.181, p<0.05) were positively correlated with fT4. Role emotional was negatively correlated with TSH (r=-0.185, p<0.05) and anti-TPO (r=-0.234, p<0.05). Mental health was negatively correlated with anti-TPO (r=-0.287, p<0.01). HRQoL is impaired and depression and anxiety scores are high in patients with euthyroid HT independent of levothyroxine replacement. Therefore, our results indicate that thyroid autoimmunity itself may have an impact on psychological well-being in euthyroid patients with HT.","['Anxiety', 'Autoimmunity', 'Depression', 'Hashimoto’s thyroiditis', 'Quality of life']"
Effectiveness of osteopathic interventions in chronic non-specific low back pain: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a frequent cause of disability and it represents a medical, social and economic burden globally. Therefore, we assessed effectiveness of osteopathic interventions in the management of NS-CLBP for pain and functional status.A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted. Findings were reported following the PRISMA statement. Six databases were searched for RCTs. Studies were independently assessed using a standardized form. Each article was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias (RoB) tool. Effect size (ES) were calculated at post-treatment and at 12 weeks' follow up. We used GRADE to assess quality of evidence.10 articles were included. Studies investigated osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT, n = 6), myofascial release (MFR, n = 2), craniosacral treatment (CST, n = 1) and osteopathic visceral manipulation (OVM, n = 1). None of the study was completely judged at low RoB. Osteopathy revealed to be more effective than control interventions in pain reduction (ES: -0.59; 95% CI: -0.81, -0.36; P < 0.00,001) and in improving functional status (ES: -0.42; 95% 95% CI: -0.68, -0.15; P = 0.002). Moderate-quality evidence suggested that MFR is more effective than control treatments in pain reduction (ES: -0.69; 95% CI: -1.05, -0.33; P = 0.0002), even at follow-up (ES: -0.73; 95% CI: -1.09, -0.37; P < 0.0001). Low-quality evidence suggested superiority of OMT in pain reduction (ES: -0.57; 95% CI: -0.90, -0.25; P = 0.001) and in changing functional status (ES: -0.34; 95% CI: -0.65, -0.03; P = 0.001). Very low-quality evidence suggested that MFR is more effective than control interventions in functional improvements (ES: -0.73; 95% CI: -1.25, -0.21; P = 0.006).Results strengthen evidence that osteopathy is effective in pain levels and functional status improvements in NS-CLBP patients. MFR reported better level of evidence for pain reduction if compared to other interventions. Further high-quality RCTs, comparing different osteopathic modalities, are recommended to produce better-quality evidence.","['Chronic low back pain', 'Manipulation', 'Myofascial release', 'Osteopathic manipulative treatment', 'Systematic review']"
Xpert MTB/RIF assay for the diagnosis of rifampicin resistance in different regions: a meta-analysis.,"To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance in different regions, a meta-analysis was carried out.Several databases were searched for relevant studies up to March 3, 2019. A bivariate random-effects model was used to estimate the diagnostic accuracy.We identified 97 studies involving 26,037 samples for the diagnosis of rifampicin resistance. The pooled sensitivity, specificity and AUC of Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance detection were 0.93 (95% CI 0.90-0.95), 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.98) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.97-0.99), respectively. For different regions, the pooled sensitivity were 0.94(95% CI 0.89-0.97) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.88-0.94), the pooled specificity were 0.98 (95% CI 0.94-1.00) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.99), and the AUC were 0.99 (95% CI 0.98-1.00) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.97-0.99) in high and middle/low income countries, respectively. The pooled sensitivity were 0.91 (95% CI 0.87-0.94) and 0.91 (95% CI 0.86-0.94), the pooled specificity were 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.99) and 0.98 (95% CI 0.96-0.99), and the AUC were 0.98 (95% CI 0.97-0.99) and 0.99 (95% CI 0.97-0.99) in high TB burden and middle/low prevalence countries, respectively.The diagnostic accuracy of Xpert MTB/RIF for rifampicin resistance detection was excellent.","['Income', 'Metaanalysis', 'Prevalence', 'Rifampicin resistance', 'Xpert MTBRIF']"
Efficacy of Different Powers of Low-Level Red Light in Children for Myopia Control.,"To compare the efficacy and safety of low-level red light (LRL) in controlling myopia progression at 3 different powers: 0.37 mW, 0.60 mW, and 1.20 mW.Single-center, single-masked, randomized controlled trial.Two hundred children aged 6-15 with myopia of -0.50 diopter (D) or more and astigmatism of -2.50 D or less were enrolled from April to May 2022. Follow-up ended in December 2022.Participants were assigned randomly to 3 intervention groups and 1 control group (1:1:1:1). All participants wore single-vision spectacles. Moreover, the intervention group randomly received LRL at 3 different powers twice daily for 3 minutes per session, with a minimum 4-hour interval.Changes in spherical equivalent (SE), axial length (AL), and subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) were measured.After 6 months, SE progression was significantly lower in the 0.37-mW group (0.01 D; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.12 to 0.15), 0.60-mW group (-0.05 D; 95% CI, -0.18 to 0.07), and 1.20-mW group (0.16 D; 95% CI, 0.03 to 0.30) compared to the control group (-0.22 D; 95% CI, -0.50 to 0.30; adjusted P < 0.001 for all). AL changes in the 0.37-mW group (0.04 mm; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.08), 0.60-mW group (0.00 mm; 95% CI, -0.05 to 0.05), and 1.20-mW group (-0.04 mm; 95% CI, -0.08 to 0.01) were significantly smaller than the control group (0.27 mm; 95% CI, 0.22 to 0.33; adjusted P < 0.001 for all). Similarly, increases in SFCT were significantly greater in the 0.37-mW group (22.63 μm; 95% CI, 12.13 to 33.34 μm), 0.60-mW group (36.17 μm; 95% CI, 24.37 to 48.25 μm), and 1.20-mW group (42.59 μm; 95% CI, 23.43 to 66.24 μm) than the control group (-5.07 μm; 95% CI, -10.32 to -0.13 μm; adjusted P < 0.001 for all). No adverse events were observed.LRL effectively controlled myopia progression at 0.37 mW, 0.60 mW, and 1.20 mW. Further research is required.The author(s) have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article.","['Axial length', 'Different power', 'Lowlevel red light', 'Myopia control', 'Subfoveal choroidal thickness']"
Fatty Acids Profile of Wild and Cultivar Tunisian Peanut Oilseeds (A. hypogaea L.) at Different Developmental Stages.,"Eleven fatty acids were identified during maturity in the wild (AraA) and varieties peanut kernels (AraC and AraT). These fatty acids included C<sub>16:0</sub> (palmitic acid), C<sub>18:0</sub> (stearic acid), C<sub>18:1</sub> (oleic acid), C<sub>18:2</sub> (linoleic acid), C<sub>19:0</sub> (nonadecanoic acid), C<sub>20:1</sub> (gadoleic acid), C<sub>20:0</sub> (arachidic acid), C<sub>22:1</sub> (erucic acid), C<sub>22:0</sub> (behenic acid), C<sub>23:0</sub> (tricosanoic acid) and C<sub>24:0</sub> (linoceric acid). Two fatty acids C<sub>19:0</sub> and C<sub>23:0</sub> were not previously detected from peanut kernels. Furthermore, eight major fatty acids (C<sub>16:0</sub>, C<sub>18:0</sub>, C<sub>18:1</sub>, C<sub>18:2</sub>, C<sub>20:0</sub>, C<sub>20:1</sub>, C<sub>22:0</sub> and C<sub>24:0</sub>) were quantified during maturity. Wild AraA was distinguished by its highest level of oleic (38.72%) and stearic (2.63%) acids contents and the lowest one of linoleic acid (19.40%) compared to the varieties. As for the O/L ratio, wild AraA presents a significantly higher (p < 0.05) (O/L = 2) than that of the AraC and AraT varieties with (O/L = 1.7 and 1.04) respectively. Correlation coefficients (r) between the eight major fatty acids revealed an inverse association between oleic and linoleic acids (r = -0.99, p < 0.001), while linoleic acid was positively correlated to palmitic acid (r = 0.97). These results aim to provide a detailed basis for quality improvement in the cultivated peanut with wild resources.","['GCMS', 'OL', 'correlation coefficients', 'cultivar peanut', 'fatty acids', 'wild peanut']"
The relationship between perceptions of school climate and internet gaming disorder of teenage students: A moderated mediation model.,"In recent years, teenage students' internet gaming disorder has raised widespread concern in the society. The current study aims to explore how perceptions of school climate, maladaptive cognition, and belief in a just world impact teenage students' internet gaming disorder and seek the suitable intervention to prevent teenage students' internet gaming disorder tendency.A total of 1,164 teenage students (age: 19.62 ± 3.14 years) were evaluated using the Perceived School Climate Scale (PSCS), Maladaptive Cognition Scale (MCS), Belief in a Just World Scale (BJWS), and Internet Gaming Disorder Scale (IGDS).(1) Perceptions of school climate could predict teenage students' internet gaming disorder [β = -0.15, <i>p</i> < 0.001, 95% CI = (-0.20, -0.11)]. (2) Teenage students' maladaptive cognition exerts a partial mediating effect between their perceptions of school climate and internet gaming disorder [ab = -0.13, boot <i>SE</i> = 0.01, 95% CI = (-0.16, -0.11)]. (3) The direct effect of perceptions of school climate on internet gaming disorder [β = -0.07, <i>p</i> < 0.01, <i>95% CI</i> = (-0.11, -0.02)], the first half of the mediation model ""perceptions of school climate → maladaptive cognition"" [β = -0.08, <i>p</i> < 0.01, 95% <i>CI</i> = (-0.12, -0.03)], and the second half of the mediation model ""maladaptive cognition → internet gaming disorder"" [β = 0.10, <i>p</i> < 0.001, 95% CI = (0.06, 0.14)] are all moderated reciprocally by teenage students' belief in a just world.Schools should create a good climate and shape belief in a just world to reduce the maladaptive cognition of teenagers, to effectively prevent teenage students' internet gaming disorder tendency.","['belief in a just world', 'internet gaming disorder', 'maladaptive cognition', 'school climate', 'teenager students']"
Transport losses in market weight pigs: II. U.S. incidence and economic impact.,"An industry survey representing approximately 310 million (M) market weight pigs was conducted with 20 U.S. slaughter facilities over the calendars years of 2012 to 2015 to determine the incidence, seasonal patterns, and estimated economic impact of dead and non-ambulatory pigs. Each plant entered daily totals in a secure online database for the following variables: 1) pigs slaughtered, 2) dead on arrival (DOA; dead on the truck), 3) euthanized on arrival (EOA; non-ambulatory pig with an injury that required euthanasia), 4) dead in pen (DIP; died after unloading), and 5) non-ambulatory (pig unable to move or keep up with the rest of the group from unloading to stunning). Total dead pigs were calculated as DOA + EOA + DIP, and total losses were calculated as non-ambulatory + total dead. The economic impact was estimated based on the 4-yr weighted averages from USDA annual reports for market swine slaughtered (108,470,550 pigs), live market weight (126.9 kg), and live market price ($1.44/kg). The 4-yr weighted averages for total dead, non-ambulatory, and total losses were 0.26%, 0.63%, and 0.88%, respectively. Total dead consisted of 0.15% DOA, 0.05% EOA, and 0.05% DIP. The months with the highest rates of total dead were July (0.29%), August (0.32%), and September (0.30%), while the lowest incidence rates occurred in February (0.22%), March (0.22%), and April (0.22%). The months with the highest rates of non-ambulatory pigs were observed during the months of October (0.70%), November (0.71%), and December (0.70%), whereas the lowest rates of non-ambulatory pigs were observed during the months of April (0.57%), May (0.53%), and June (0.54%). The following assumptions were used in the economic analysis: 1) dead pigs received no value and 2) non-ambulatory pigs were discounted 30%. Based on these assumptions, the annual cost to the industry for dead and non-ambulatory pigs was estimated to be $52 M ($0.48 per pig marketed) and $37 M ($0.35 per pig marketed), respectively. Therefore, total losses represent approximately $89 M in economic losses or $0.83 per pig marketed. This is the first industry-wide survey on the incidence of transport losses in market weight pigs at U.S. slaughter facilities, and this information is important for establishing an industry baseline and benchmark for transport losses that can be used for measuring industry improvements.","['fatigued', 'injured', 'mortality', 'nonambulatory', 'swine', 'transport']"
"A randomized triple-blind clinical trial to compare the effectiveness of topical triamcinolone acetonate (0.1%), clobetasol propionate (0.05%), and tacrolimus orabase (0.03%) in the management of oral lichen planus.","Oral lichen planus (OLP) is believed to result from an abnormal T-cell mediated immune response. The most useful agent in the treatment is corticosteroids. The present study will be aimed at evaluation of therapeutic efficiency of two corticosteroids triamcinolone acetonate (0.1%) and clobetasol propionate with tacrolimus orabase (0.03%), an immunomodulator in the management of OLP.To compare the effectiveness of topical triamcinolone acetonate (0.1%), clobetasol propionate (0.05%), and tacrolimus orabase (0.03%) in the management of OLP and also to compare which has less recurrence.The study comprises 30 patients, all were diagnosed with OLP clinically and histopathologically. They are randomly divided into three groups: Group A - triamcinolone acetonate (0.1%), Group B - clobetasol propionate (0.05%), and Group C - tacrolimus (0.03%). A formal informed consent was obtained from all of them who participated in the study.Subjects in the Group A (triamcinolone 0.1%) and Group B (clobetasol 0.05%) show a significant reduction in lesion size than that of Group C (tacrolimus 0.03%). Group B (clobetasol 0.05%) shows a better significant reduction in lesion size than that of Group A (triamcinolone 0.1%). The overall treatment response was significant better in the Group B (clobetasol 0.05%). No recurrence was observed in any of the three groups at the end of 3 months. It is concluded that clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment has higher efficacy when compared to triamcinolone acetonide 0.1% ointment and tacrolimus ointment 0.03% in the management of OLP. It was also inferred that triamcinolone 0.1% has better effects than tacrolimus 0.03%.","['Clobetasol propionate', 'oral lichen planus', 'tacrolimus', 'triamcinolone acetonate']"
Accelerated Early Vascular Aging Among Adolescents With Obesity and/or Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Background The normal rate of subclinical vascular aging from adolescence to young adulthood has not been well-characterized. We conducted a 5-year longitudinal study among adolescents with normal-weight, obesity, and/or type 2 diabetes mellitus to examine trajectories of early vascular aging. Methods and Results Adolescents (mean [SD] age 17.6 [3.5]; 35.3% male) had either normal weight (n=141), obesity (n=156), or type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=151) at baseline. Primary metrics used for early vascular aging included measures of vascular structure (carotid intima-media thickness [cIMT]; common, internal, and bulb) and arterial stiffness (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, and augmentation index). Longitudinal (5-year) outcomes were examined using generalized estimating equations adjusting for baseline value, sex, race, and age. Compared with participants with normal weight, those with obesity had greater positive change in common cIMT (0.05 mm [0.03, 0.06]; <i>P</i><0.001), bulb cIMT (0.02 mm [0.00, 0.05]; <i>P</i>=0.033), internal cIMT (0.03 mm [0.01, 0.05]; <i>P</i><0.001), and pulse wave velocity carotid-femoral (0.38 m/sec [0.14, 0.61]; <i>P</i>=0.001), and those with type 2 diabetes mellitus had greater positive change in common cIMT (0.05 mm [0.04, 0.07]; <i>P</i><0.001), bulb cIMT (0.06 mm [0.04, 0.09]; <i>P</i><0.001), internal cIMT (0.04 mm [0.02, 0.07]; <i>P</i><0.001), augmentation index (4.67% [2.20, 7.13]; <i>P</i><0.001), and pulse wave velocity carotid-femoral (0.74 m/sec [0.46, 1.02]; <i>P</i><0.001). Higher baseline systolic blood pressure was associated with greater positive change in common cIMT (0.007 mm [0.003, 0.011]; <i>P</i><0.001), bulb cIMT (0.009 mm [0.002, 0.016]; <i>P</i>=0.01), internal cIMT (0.008 mm [0.003, 0.013]; <i>P</i>=0.001), and pulse wave velocity carotid-femoral (0.066 m/sec [0.002, 0.130]; <i>P</i>=0.042). Conclusions These longitudinal data support the hypothesis that the presence of obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and elevated baseline systolic blood pressure in early life accelerates the progression of risk factors key in the development of early vascular aging.","['adolescent', 'cardiovascular', 'longitudinal', 'subclinical']"
Intake of Dietary Fiber From Grains and the Risk of Hypertension in Late Midlife Women: Results From the SWAN Study.,"<b>Background:</b> The possible effects of dietary fiber intake on hypertension have not been clarified fully. The association of dietary fiber intake with hypertension risk in midlife women was analyzed in this study. <b>Methods:</b> Baseline data were obtained from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation (SWAN). Smooth curve, linear regression, and logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the associations of four indices of daily dietary estimate (DDE) of dietary fiber (dietary fiber intake, dietary fiber intake from beans, dietary fiber intake from vegetables/fruit, and dietary fiber intake from grains) with blood pressure in midlife women. For this research purpose, diastolic blood pressure (DBP) ≥90 mmHg was defined as diastolic hypertension, and systolic blood pressure <b>(</b>SBP) ≥140 mmHg was defined as systolic hypertension. <b>Results:</b> This study included 2,519 participants with an average age of 46. The smooth curve showed approximate negative correlations between three fiber indices (DDE dietary fiber, DDE fiber from vegetables/fruit, and DDE fiber from grains) and blood pressure, including DBP and SBP (all <i>P</i> < 0.005). There were also approximate negative correlations between two fiber indices (DDE dietary fiber and DDE fiber from grains) and the risk of diastolic hypertension and systolic hypertension (all <i>P</i> < 0.05). Furthermore, multiple linear regression analysis suggested that DDE dietary fiber (Sβ = -0.057, 95% CI -0.194 - -0.012, <i>P</i> = 0.027), DDE fiber from vegetables/fruit (Sβ = -0.046, 95% CI -0.263 - -0.007, <i>P</i> = 0.039), and DDE fiber from grains (Sβ = -0.073, 95% CI -0.600 - -0.099, <i>P</i> = 0.006, Model 4) were still negatively correlated with DBP after adjusting for confounding factors. Only DDE fiber from grains was independently and negatively associated with SBP (Sβ = -0.060, 95% CI -0.846 - -0.093, <i>P</i> = 0.015) after these same confounding factors were adjusted for. Importantly, multiple logistic regression analysis suggested that only higher DDE fiber from grains was independently associated with a reduced risk of diastolic hypertension (OR = 0.848, 95% CI 0.770-0.934, <i>P</i> = 0.001, Model 4) and systolic hypertension (OR = 0.906, 95% CI 0.826-0.993, <i>P</i> = 0.034, Model 4) after the adjustments were made for confounding factors. <b>Conclusions:</b> We found that dietary fiber intake, especially DDE fiber from grains, contributes to a lower risk of systolic hypertension and diastolic hypertension in midlife women.","['blood pressure', 'dietary fiber', 'hypertension', 'midlife women', 'smooth curve']"
Do Impairments in Visual Functions Affect Skiing Performance?,"Nordic and alpine skiing-related visual tasks such as identifying hill contours, slope characteristics, and snow conditions increase demands on contrast processing and other visual functions. Prospective observational studies were conducted to assess the relationships between skiing performance and a broad range of visual functions in nordic and alpine skiers with vision impairments. The study hypothesized that contrast sensitivity (CS), visual acuity (VA), and visual field (VF) would be predictive of skiing performance. Binocular static VA, CS, light sensitivity, glare sensitivity, glare recovery, dynamic VA, translational and radial motion perception, and VF were assessed in elite Para nordic (<i>n</i> = 26) and Para alpine (<i>n</i> = 15) skiers. Skiing performance was assessed based on skiers' raw race times. Performance on the visual function tests was compared with skiing performances using Kendall's correlations (with and without Bonferroni-Holm corrections) and linear multivariable regressions (<i>p</i> < 0.05 considered significant). None of the vision variables were significantly correlated with performance in Para nordic or Para alpine skiing after Bonferroni-Holm corrections were applied. Before applying the corrections, VF extent (ρ = -0.37, <i>p</i> = 0.011), and static VA (ρ = 0.26, <i>p</i> = 0.066) demonstrated the strongest correlations with Para nordic skiing performance; in Para alpine skiing, static VA and CS demonstrated the strongest correlations with downhill (static VA: ρ = 0.54, <i>p</i> = 0.046, CS: ρ = -0.50, <i>p</i> = 0.06), super G (static VA: ρ = 0.50, <i>p</i> = 0.007, CS: ρ = -0.51, <i>p</i> = 0.017), and giant slalom (static VA: ρ = 0.57, <i>p</i> = 0.01, CS: ρ = -0.46, <i>p</i> = 0.017) performance. Dynamic VA and VF were significantly associated with downhill (ρ = 0.593, <i>p</i> = 0.04) and slalom (ρ = -0.49, <i>p</i> = 0.013) performances, respectively. Static VA was a significant predictor of giant slalom [(<i>F</i>(3,11) = 24.71, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and <i>R</i> of 0.87], super G [(<i>F</i>(3,9) = 17.34, <i>p</i> = 0.002), and <i>R</i> of 0.85], and slalom [(<i>F</i>(3,11) = 11.8, <i>p</i> = 0.002), and <i>R</i> of 0.80] performance, but CS and VF were not. Interestingly, static VA and CS were highly correlated in both Para nordic (ρ = -0.60, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and Para alpine (ρ = -0.80, <i>p</i> < 0.001) skiers. Of the vision variables, only static VA and VF were associated with skiing performance and should be included as the in Para nordic and Para alpine classifications. The strong correlations between static VA and CS in these skiers with vision impairment may have masked relationships between CS and skiing performance.","['Paralympic alpine skiing', 'Paralympic nordic skiing', 'contrast sensitivity', 'visual acuity', 'visual field']"
"Reciprocal Associations Between Sleep, Mental Strain, and Training Load in Junior Endurance Athletes and the Role of Poor Subjective Sleep Quality.","The importance of adequate sleep for athletic functioning is well established. Still, the literature shows that many athletes report sleep of suboptimal quality or quantity. To date, no research has investigated how bidirectional variations in mental and physiological states influence sleep patterns. The present study, therefore, investigates reciprocal associations between sleep, mental strain, and training load by utilizing a prospective, observational design. In all, 56 junior endurance athletes were followed over 61 consecutive days. Unobtrusive, objective measurements of sleep with novel radar technology were obtained, and subjective daily reports of mental strain and training load were collected. The role of subjective sleep quality was investigated to identify whether the reciprocal associations between sleep, mental strain, and training load depended on being a good versus poor sleeper. Multilevel modeling with Bayesian estimation was used to investigate the relationships. The results show that increases in mental strain are associated with decreased total sleep time (TST, 95% CI = -0.12 to -0.03), light sleep (95% CI = -0.08 to -0.00), and sleep efficiency (95% CI = -0.95 to -0.09). Further, both mental strain and training load are associated with subsequent deceased rapid eye movement (REM, respectively, 95% CI = -0.05 to -0.00 and 95% CI = -0.06 to -0.00) sleep. Increases in TST, light, deep, and REM sleep are all associated with subsequent decreased training load (respectively, 95% CI = -0.09 to -0.03; 95% CI = -0.10 to -0.01; 95% CI = -0.22 to -0.02; 95% CI = -0.18 to -0.03). Finally, among poor sleepers, increases in sleep onset latency are associated with increases in subsequent mental strain (95% CI = 0.09-0.46), and increases in deep sleep are associated with decreases in subsequent training load (95% CI = -67.65 to 11.43). These results offer novel insight into the bidirectional associations between sleep, mental strain, and training load in athletes and demonstrate the detrimental effects of mental strain on sleep, likely caused by mental activation incompatible with sleep. An increased need for recovery, suggested by increased TST and time in different sleep stages, is associated with subsequent self-regulatory reduction of training loads by the athletes. In poor sleepers, increases in deep sleep may suggest an elevated need for physiological recovery.","['athlete', 'mental strain', 'sleep', 'sleep quality', 'training load']"
[A biomechanical study on effect of deep radioulnar ligaments on the distal radioulnar joint rotatory stability repaired by bone suture anchors].,"To discuss the role of the bone suture anchors for repair of avulsed deep radioulnar ligaments in maintaining the rotatory stability of the distal radioulnar joint.Nine upper limbs specimens were selected from fresh adult cadavers to make wrist joint-bone capsular ligaments complex specimen. All the specimens were tested under conditions of intact (normal group), deep radioulnar ligaments injury (injury group), and deep radioulnar ligaments injury repaired with anchoring (repair group). The internal and external rotation torque values were recorded in 45° wrist extension, neutral position, and 45° wrist flexion by AG-IS series MS biomechanical testing system. The statistic software was used to compare difference in rotation torque between groups.In 45° wrist extension, neutral position, and 45° wrist flexion, the internal rotation torque values in normal group were (0.83±0.33), (0.86±0.34), and (0.36±0.30) N·m respectively; the external rotation torque values were (0.86±0.38), (0.44±0.22), and (0.25±0.21) N·m respectively. The internal rotation torque values in injury group were (0.18±0.17), (0.22±0.17), and (0.16±0.15) N·m respectively; the external rotation torque values were (0.27±0.26), (0.13±0.17), and (0.04±0.04) N·m respectively. The internal rotation torque values in repair group were (0.79±0.34), (0.73±0.33), and (0.41±0.23) N·m respectively; the external rotation torque values were (0.80±0.39), (0.41±0.22), (0.41±0.40) N·m respectively. In 45° wrist extension, neutral position, and 45° wrist flexion, the internal and external rotation torque values in injury group were significantly lower than those in normal group and repair group ( <i>P</i><0.05), but no significant difference was found between repair group and normal group ( <i>P</i>>0.05).The deep radioulnar ligaments are important structure for maintaining rotatory stability of distal radioulnar joint. Bone anchoring of the avulsed deep radioulnar ligaments to the ulna fovea is critically important in reconstructing function anatomy of the distal radioulnar joint.","['Wrist', 'biomechanics', 'deep radioulnar ligament', 'distal radioulnar joint', 'triangular fibrocartilage complex']"
Prophylactic abdominal drainage following appendectomy for complicated appendicitis: A meta-analysis.,"To date, the value of prophylactic abdominal drainage (AD) following appendectomy in patients with complicated appendicitis (CA), including adults and children, has yet to be determined. This paper presents a meta-analysis of the effects of prophylactic AD on postoperative complications in patients with CA, with the goal of exploring the safety and effectiveness of prophylactic AD.PubMed, Science Direct, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were searched for relevant articles published before August 1, 2022. The primary outcomes were the complication rates [overall incidence of postoperative complications, incidence of intra-abdominal abscess (IAA), wound infection (WI), and postoperative ileus (PI), and the secondary outcome was the perioperative outcome]. The meta-analysis was performed with STATA V. 16.0A.A total of 2,627 articles were retrieved and 15 high-quality articles were eventually included after screening, resulting in a total of 5,123 patients, of whom 1,796 received AD and 3,327 did not. The results of this meta-analysis showed that compared with patients in the non-drainage group, patients in the drainage group had longer postoperative length of hospitalization (LOH) (SMD = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.01-1.35, <i>P</i> = 0.046), higher overall incidence of postoperative complications (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.19-0.81, <i>P</i> = 0.01), higher incidence of WI (OR = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.08-0.51, <i>P</i> = 0.01) and PI (OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.57-1.54, <i>P</i> = 0.01), the differences were statistically significant. However, there was no significant difference in the incidence of IAA (OR = 0.10, 95% CI: -0.10 to 0.31, <i>P</i> = 0.31) between the two groups. The results of subgroup meta-analysis showed that in the adult subgroup, the overall incidence of postoperative complications in the drainage group was higher than that in the non-drainage group (OR = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.37-0.96, <i>P</i> = 0.01). However, there were no significant differences in IAA (OR = 0.18, 95% CI: -0.28 to 0.64, <i>P</i> = 0.45) and WI (OR = 0.13, 95% CI: (-0.40 to 0.66, <i>P</i> = 0.63) and PI (OR = 2.71, 95% CI: -0.29 to 5.71, <i>P</i> = 0.08). In the children subgroup, there were no significant differences in the incidence of IAA (OR = 0.51, 95% CI: -0.06 to 1.09, <i>P</i> = 0.08) between the two groups. The overall incidence of postoperative complications (OR = 0.46, 95% CI: 0.02-0.90, <i>P</i> = 0.04), incidences of WI (OR = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.14-0.71, <i>P</i> = 0.01) and PI (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.10-1.39, <i>P</i> = 0.02) were significantly higher than those in the non-drainage group.This meta-analysis concluded that prophylactic AD did not benefit from appendectomy, but increased the incidence of related complications, especially in children with CA. Thus, there is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of prophylactic AD following appendectomy.","['abdominal drainage', 'appendectomy', 'complicated appendicitis', 'metaanalysis', 'postoperative complications']"
"Impact of Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Adolescence, Young Adulthood, and Midlife on Late-Life Cognition: Study of Healthy Aging in African Americans.","Midlife cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs) increase risk of dementia. Black Americans experience an elevated prevalence of CVRFs and dementia. However, little is known of how CVRFs prior to midlife affect late-life cognition. We examined CVRFs in adolescence, young adulthood, and midlife with late-life cognition in the Study of Healthy Aging in African Americans (STAR).STAR assesses cognitive aging among 764 Black Americans aged ≥50 (mean age = 69; SD = 9; range = 53-95). Participants' body mass index, blood pressure, glucose, and total cholesterol were collected during Multiphasic Health Checkups (MHC; 1964-1985). At STAR baseline (2018-2019), executive function, verbal episodic memory, and semantic memory were measured using the Spanish and English Neuropsychological Assessment Scales. Linear regression models examined associations between CVRFs and cognition adjusting for demographics and years since MHC.At MHC, 36% of participants had 1 CVRF and 26% had ≥2. Twenty-two percent of participants were adolescents (age 12-20), 62% young adults (age 21-34), and 16% midlife adults (age 35-56). Overweight/obesity was not associated with cognition. Hypertension was associated with worse executive function (β [95% CI]: -0.14 [-0.28, -0.0003]) and verbal episodic memory (β [95% CI]: -0.22 [-0.37, -0.07]) compared to normotension. Diabetes was associated with worse executive function (β [95% CI]: -0.43 [-0.83, -0.03]). Having ≥2 CVRFs (vs 0) was associated with worse executive function (β [95% CI]: -0.19 [-0.34, -0.03]) and verbal episodic memory (β [95% CI]: -0.25 [-0.41, -0.08]). Adolescents with hypertension had lower late-life executive function compared to normotensive adolescents (β [95% CI]: -0.39 [-0.67, -0.11]). Young adulthood hypertension (β [95% CI]: -0.29 [-0.49, -0.09]) and midlife hyperlipidemia (β [95% CI]: -0.386 [-0.70, -0.02]) were associated with lower verbal episodic memory.Among Black Americans, life-course CVRFs were associated with poorer executive function and verbal episodic memory emphasizing the importance of cardiovascular health on the aging brain.","['Black Americans', 'Cardiovascular disease', 'Cognitive aging', 'Dementia', 'Life course']"
"Plasma adiponectin, IL-6, hsCRP, and TNF-α levels in subject with diabetic foot and their correlation with clinical variables in a North Indian tertiary care hospital.","Pro- and anti-inflammatory processes are crucial in different phases of wound healing and their disturbances interfere with tissue homeostasis after the manifestation of ulcers, leading to chronic non-healing wounds. However, data on the association between infl ammation and acute foot syndrome are scarce.Circulating levels of acute-phase reactants and cytokines were measured in diabetic patients with ulcer (n = 162) and without ulcer (n = 162) in a case control study.Of the patients, 85.1% had type 2 diabetes. Subjects with diabetic foot ulcer showed lower median plasma level of adiponectin [8.4 (7.1-9.2) ng/ml vs. 13.4 (12.1-14.2) ng/ml], and higher median plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) [32.5 (9.4-44.8) ng/ml vs. 6.7 (4.6-14.6) ng/ml], high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) [12.6 (11.2-13.6) mg/ml vs. 8.4 (7.1-9.2) mg/ml], and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) [99.4 (79.9-121.5) ng/ml vs. 4.9 (4.5-5.6) ng/ml]. A positive correlation was found between body mass index (BMI) (r = -0.088, P < 0.264) and retinopathy (r = 0.249, P < 0.001) for adiponectin. For IL-6, it was between grade of ulcer (r = 0.250, P < 0.001), BMI (r = -0.161, P < 0.04), low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) (r = -0.155, P < 0.049), triglycerides (r = -0.165, P < 0.035), retinopathy (r = -0.166, P < 0.035), nephropathy (r = -0.199, P < 0.011), and smoking (r = -0.164, P < 0.036). For hsCRP: grade of ulcer (r = 0.236, P < 0.002), BMI (r = -0.155, P < 0.048), LDL-C (r = -0.174, P < 0.026), triglycerides (r = -0.216, P < 0.005), retinopathy (r = -0.165, P < 0.037), nephropathy (r = -0.028, P < 0.007), and smoking (r = -0.164, P < 0.036), while total cholesterol (r = -0.209, P < 0.007) and neuropathy (r = 0.141, P < 0.072) for TNF-α.This study demonstrates that diabetic subjects with various grades of diabetic foot ulcer showed a higher IL-6, hsCRP, TNF-α, and lower adiponectin plasma levels in comparison with diabetes without foot ulcer, independent of the concomitant infections. It would be interesting to fi nd out whether an activation of immune system precedes the development of foot ulcer and whether anti-infl ammatory therapies might be effective in improving the outcome in such patients.","['Correlation', 'India', 'diabetic foot ulcer', 'inflammatory marker']"
Effect of 0.02% and 0.01% atropine on astigmatism: a two-year clinical trial.,"To evaluate the effects of 0.02% and 0.01% atropine eye drops on ocular and corneal astigmatism over 2 years.A prospective clinic-controlled trail. The cohort study assessed 400 myopic children and divided them into three groups: 138 and 142 children were randomized to use either 0.02% or 0.01% atropine eye drops, respectively. They wore single-vision (SV) spectacles, with one drop of atropine applied to both eyes once nightly. Control children (n = 120) only wore SV spectacles. Spherical equivalent refractive errors (SER) and corneal curvature were measured every 4 months. The SER and corneal curvature were assessed by cycloplegic autorefraction and IOLMaster. Ocular and corneal astigmatism were calculated by Thibos vector analysis and then split into its power vector components, J0 (with-the-rule astigmatism) and J45 (oblique).After 2 years, the ocular astigmatism increased by -0.38 ± 0.29 D, -0.47 ± 0.38 D, -0.41 ± 0.35 D in the 0.02%, 0.01% atropine groups and control group, respectively (p = 0.15). The corresponding corneal astigmatism increased by -0.20 ± 0.34 D, -0.28 ± 0.35 D and -0.26 ± 0.26 D (p = 0.18). The ocular astigmatism J0 increased by 0.19 ± 0.28 D, 0.22 ± 0.36 D, 0.18 ± 0.31 D in the 0.02% atropine, 0.01% atropine and control groups, respectively (p = 0.65). The corresponding corneal astigmatism J0 increased by -0.05 ± 0.34 D, -0.11 ± 0.37 D and -0.13 ± 0.30 D (p = 0.23). There was a small but significant increase in ocular astigmatism (including J0) (all P < 0.05), but there were no changes in the ocular astigmatism J45 and corneal astigmatism (including J0 and J45) in the three groups over time (all p > 0.05). However, there were no significant differences in the changes in ocular astigmatism (including J0) among the three groups.Treatment with 0.02% and 0.01% atropine had no clinically significant effect on ocular and corneal astigmatism over 2 years.The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, ChiCTR-IPD-16008844 .

Diathermy versus scalpel for skin incision in patients undergoing open inguinal hernia repair: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To compare outcomes of diathermy and scalpel for skin incision in patients undergoing open inguinal hernia repair.We performed a systematic review in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement standards. We conducted a search of electronic information sources to identify all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies comparing use of diathermy and scalpel for skin incision in patients undergoing inguinal hernia repair. Surgical site infection (SSI) was the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcome measures included haematoma, seroma, visual analogue scale (VAS) pain score at 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h, and incision time. We used Cochrane risk of bias tool and ROBINS-I tool to assess the risk of bias of randomised and non-randomised studies. Fixed-effect model was applied to calculate pooled outcome data.We identified 9 studies, 4 randomised controlled trials and 5 prospective cohort studies, enrolling a total of 830 patients. Meta-analysis of RCTs showed no difference between the diathermy and scalpel groups in terms of surgical site infection (OR: 0.77, 95% CI 0.34, 1.75, P = 0.53), seroma (OR: 0.86, 95% CI 0.29, 2.55, P = 0.78), VAS pain score at 6 h (MD: -0.10, 95% CI -0.31, 0.11, P = 0.34), 12 h (MD: -0.10, 95% CI -0.13, 0.33, P = 0.40), and 24 h (MD: 0.03, 95% CI -0.16, 0.21, P = 0.79). Use of diathermy for skin incision was associated with shorter incision time (MD: -36.00, 95% CI -47.92, -24.08, P < 0.00001) and lower risk of haematoma (OR: 0.14, 95% CI 0.03, 0.65, P = 0.01). Meta-analysis of observational studies showed no difference between the diathermy and scalpel groups in terms of surgical site infection (OR: 0.87, 95% CI 0.54, 1.39, P = 0.55), haematoma (OR 0.14, 95% CI 0.02-1.23, P = 0.08), seroma (OR: 0.86, 95% CI 0.29, 2.55, P = 0.78), VAS pain score at 6 h (MD: -0.10, 95% CI -0.44, 0.24, P = 0.56), 12 h (MD: -0.10, 95% CI -0.26, 0.46, P = 0.58), and 24 h (MD: 0.10, 95% CI -0.27, 0.47, P = 0.59). Use of diathermy for skin incision was associated with shorter incision time (MD: -39.40, 95% CI -41.02, -37.78, P < 0.00001). The results remained consistent through sensitivity analyses. The between-study heterogeneity was low and the quality of the available evidence was moderate.There is no difference between use of diathermy and scalpel for skin incision in patients undergoing open inguinal hernia repair in terms of surgical site infection, seroma and postoperative pain. Use of diathermy for skin incision may be associated with shorter incision time and may reduce the risk of haematoma formation.","['Diathermy', 'Inguinal hernia', 'Scalpel']"
Alerting effects of light in healthy individuals: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Light plays an essential role in psychobiological and psychophysiological processes, such as alertness. The alerting effect is influenced by light characteristics and the timing of interventions. This meta-analysis is the first to systematically review the effect of light intervention on alertness and to discuss the optimal protocol for light intervention. In this meta-analysis, registered at PROSPERO (Registration ID: CRD42020181485), we conducted a systematic search of the Web of Science, PubMed, and PsycINFO databases for studies published in English prior to August 2021. The outcomes included both subjective and objective alertness. Subgroup analyses considered a variety of factors, such as wavelength, correlated color temperature (CCT), light illuminance, and timing of interventions (daytime, night-time, or all day). Twenty-seven crossover studies and two parallel-group studies were included in this meta-analysis, with a total of 1210 healthy participants (636 (52%) male, mean age 25.62 years). The results revealed that light intervention had a positive effect on both subjective alertness (standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.28, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.49 to -0.06, P = 0.01) and objective alertness in healthy subjects (SMD = -0.34, 95% CI: -0.68 to -0.01, P = 0.04). The subgroup analysis revealed that cold light was better than warm light in improving subjective alertness (SMD = -0.37, 95% CI: -0.65 to -0.10, P = 0.007, I<sup>2</sup> = 26%) and objective alertness (SMD = -0.36, 95% CI: -0.66 to -0.07, P = 0.02, I<sup>2</sup> = 0). Both daytime (SMD = -0.22, 95% CI: -0.37 to -0.07, P = 0.005, I<sup>2</sup> = 74%) and night-time (SMD = -0.32, 95% CI: -0.61 to -0.02, P = 0.04, I<sup>2</sup> = 0) light exposure improved subjective alertness. The results of this meta-analysis and systematic review indicate that light exposure is associated with significant improvement in subjective and objective alertness. In addition, light exposure with a higher CCT was more effective in improving alertness than light exposure with a lower CCT. Our results also suggest that both daytime and night-time light exposure can improve subjective alertness.","['correlated color temperature', 'illuminance', 'light', 'metaanalysis', 'objective alertness', 'subjective alertness', 'time of light intervention', 'wavelength']"
The influence of equitable access policies and socioeconomic factors on post-liver transplant survival.,"Survival following liver transplant (LT) is influenced by a variety of factors, including donor risk factors and recipient disease burden and co-morbidities. It is difficult to separate these effects from those of socioeconomic factors, such as income or insurance. The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) created equitable access policies, such as Share 35, to ensure that organs are distributed to individuals with greatest medical need; however, the effect of Share 35 on disparities in post-LT survival is not clear. This study aimed to (1) characterize associations between post-transplant survival and race and ethnicity, income, insurance, and citizenship status, when adjusted for other clinical and demographic factors that may influence survival, and (2) determine if the direction of associations changed after Share 35.A retrospective, cohort study of adult LT recipients (<i>n</i> = 83,254) from the UNOS database from 2005 to 2019 was conducted. Kaplan-Meier survival graphs and stepwise multivariate cox-regression analyses were performed to characterize the effects of socioeconomic status on post-LT survival, adjusted for recipient and donor characteristics, across the time period and after Share 35.Male sex (HR: 0.93 (95% CI: 0.90-0.96)), private insurance (0.91 (0.88-0.94)), income (0.82 (0.79-0.85)), U.S. citizenship, and Asian (0.81 (0.75-0.88)) or Hispanic (0.82 (0.79-0.86)) race and ethnicity were associated with higher post-transplant survival, after adjustment for clinical and demographic factors (Table 3). These associations were found across the entire time period studied and many persisted after the implementation of Share 35 in 2013 (Table 3; male sex (0.84 (0.79-0.90)), private insurance (0.94 (0.89-1.00)), income (0.82 (0.77-0.89)), and Asian (0.87 (0.73-1.02)) or Hispanic (0.88 (0.81-0.96)) race and ethnicity).Recipients' socioeconomic factors at time of transplant may impact long-term post-transplant survival, and a single policy may not significantly alter these structural health inequalities.None.","['DDLT', 'deceased donor living transplant', 'DM', 'diabetes mellitus', 'DRI', 'donor risk index', 'HCC', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'HCV', 'hepatitis c virus', 'HE', 'hepatic encephalopathy', 'Health disparities', 'IQR', 'interquartile range', 'IRB', 'institutional review board', 'LT', 'liver transplant', 'Liver transplant', 'MELD', 'Model for EndStage Liver Disease', 'NAFLD', 'Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease', 'OPTN', 'Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network', 'STAR', 'Standard Transplant Analysis and Research', 'Socioeconomic factors', 'UNOS', 'United Network for Organ Sharing']"
Antidepressant Effects of Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Over Prefrontal Cortex of Parkinson's Disease Patients With Depression: A Meta-Analysis.,"<b>Objective:</b> The purpose of this meta-analysis was to investigate the antidepressant effects of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) and to determine the optimal rTMS parameters, such as the intensity, frequency and the delivered pattern of rTMS stimulation. <b>Methods:</b> EMBASE, PubMed, Web of Science, MEDLINE, and Cochrane data bases were researched for papers published before March 12, 2018. Studies investigating the anti-depression effects of rTMS over PFC in patients with PD were considered. The main outcomes of pre- and post-rTMS treatment as well as score changes were all extracted. The mean effect size was estimated by calculating the standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI) by using fixed or random effect models as appropriate. <b>Results:</b> Nine studies containing 137 PD patients with depression were included. The pooled results showed significant pre-post anti-depressive effects of rTMS over PFC in PD patients with depression (SMD = -0.80, <i>P</i> < 0.00001). The subgroup analyses of stimulation intensity, frequencies, and models also revealed significant effects (Intensities: 90% RMT: SMD = -1.16, <i>P</i> = 0.0006; >100% RMT: SMD = -0.82, <i>P</i> < 0.0001. Frequencies: < 1.0 Hz: SMD = -0.83, <i>P</i> = 0.03; 5.0 Hz: SMD = -1.10, <i>P</i> < 0.0001; ≥10.0 Hz: SMD = -0.55, <i>P</i> = 0.02. Models: Continuous: SMD = -0.79, <i>P</i> < 0.0001; Discontinuous: SMD = -0.84, <i>P</i> = 0.02). But the results of the studies with place-controlled designs were not significant (Overall: SMD = -0.27, <i>P</i> = 0.54. Intensities: 90% RMT: SMD = 0.27, <i>P</i> = 0.68; 100% RMT: SMD = -0.32, <i>P</i> = 0.33. Frequencies: 5.0 Hz: SMD = -0.87, <i>P</i> = 0.10; ≥10.0 Hz: SMD = 0.27, <i>P</i> = 0.66. Models: Continuous: SMD = -0.28, <i>P</i> = 0.68; Discontinuous: SMD = -0.32, <i>P</i> = 0.33). The greater effect sizes of rTMS with 90% RMT, 5.0 Hz in discontinuous days can be observed rather than the other parameters in both kinds of analyses across study design. <b>Conclusions:</b> rTMS may have a significant positive pre-post anti-depressive effect over PFC on patients with depression, especially by using 5.0 Hz frequency with 90% RMT intensity in discontinuous days, which may produce better effects than other parameters. The real effect, though, was not different from that of the placebo. Future studies with larger sample sizes and high-quality studies are needed to further corroborate our results and to identify the optimal rTMS protocols.","['Parkinsons disease', 'depression', 'metaanalysis', 'prefrontal cortex', 'repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation']"
Dietary changes and associations with metabolic improvements in adults with type 2 diabetes during a patient-centred dietary intervention: an exploratory analysis.,"Describe dietary intake of participants enrolled in a non-prescriptive dietary intervention and dietary changes at 6 months and explore whether these changes had a role in observed improvements in glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c), weight, lipids and blood pressure.Secondary analysis of data from the Early ACTivity in Diabetes randomised controlled trial.262 patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes randomised to the dietary intervention.Changes in energy intake, macronutrients, fibre and alcohol and in weight, waist circumference, lipids, HbA1c and blood pressure at baseline and 6 months. Multivariate models were used to examine associations between dietary changes and metabolic variables.Men reported reducing mean energy intake from 1903±462 kcal to 1685 kcal±439 kcal (p<0.001), increasing carbohydrate intake from 42.4±6.6% to 43.8±6.6% (p=0.002) and reducing median alcohol intake from 13 (0-27) g to 5 (0-18) g (p<0.001). Women reported reducing mean energy intake from 1582±379 kcal to 1459±326 kcal (p<0.001) with no change to macronutrient distribution and alcohol. Fibre intake was maintained. In men (n=148), weak and clinically insignificant associations were found between increased carbohydrates and reduction in HbA1c (β=-0.003 (-0.006, -0.001); p=0.009), increased fibre and reduction in total cholesterol (β=-0.023 (-0.044, -0.002); p=0.033), decreased total fat and reduction in low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (β=0.024 (0.006, 0.001); p=0.011), and decreased alcohol and reduction in diastolic blood pressure (β=0.276 (0.055, 0.497); p=0.015). In women (n=75), associations were found between a decrease in transfats and reductions in waist circumference (β=-0.029 (0.006, 0.052); p=0.015), total cholesterol (β=0.399 (0.028, 0.770); p=0.036) and LDL cholesterol (β=0.365 (0.042, 0.668); p=0.028).Clinically important metabolic improvements observed in a patient-centred dietary intervention were not explained by changes in macronutrients. However, a non-prescriptive approach may promote a reduction in total energy intake while maintaining fibre consumption.The Early ACTID trial number ISRCTN92162869.","['Dietary analysis', 'Dietary change', 'Type 2 diabetes']"
"Global market trends of flavor capsule cigarettes and menthol (non-capsule) cigarettes: An ecological analysis using commercial data across 78 countries, 2010-2020.","This study describes market trends of flavor capsule cigarettes (FCCs) and menthol (non-capsule) cigarettes (MNCCs) across 78 countries from 2010 to 2020 and examines country-level factors associated with market shares of these products.Market share and retail volume data came from the Euromonitor Passport database and country-level data came from the World Health Organization (WHO), World Bank, and International Monetary Fund. Multivariable linear fixed effects panel regression analyses were conducted to evaluate the relationship between predictor variables and the market shares of menthol (non-capsule) cigarettes and flavor capsule cigarettes.The overall market share (i.e. the percentage retail volume out of total retail volume of all cigarette types) increased from 0.23% in 2010 to 4.5% in 2020 for FCCs and decreased from 5.0% to 3.8% for MNCCs. Market shares of FCCs grew most rapidly in the Americas region and among upper middle-income countries. Market shares of MNCCs remained stable across most regions and were highest in the Western Pacific and Africa regions. The overall market share of FCCs was positively associated with the unemployment rate (β=0.28; 95% CI: 0.12-0.44, p=0.001), and inversely associated with the percent of the population aged 15-29 years (β= -0.57, 95% CI: -0.98 - -0.15, p=0.008), percent of urban population (β= -0.88; 95% CI: -1.28 - -0.48, p<0.001), GDP PPP per capita (β= -0.13; 95% CI: -0.24 - -0.03, p=0.015), and age-standardized prevalence of cigarette smoking (β= -0.93; 95% CI: -1.38 - -0.49, p<0.001). In contrast, the overall market share of MNCCs was positively associated with urbanicity (β=0.24; 95% CI: 0.08-0.40, p=0.003), and negatively associated with the unemployment rate (β= -0.09; 95% CI: -0.17 - -0.02, p=0.014).Global sales of flavor capsule cigarettes grew substantially in the last decade, surpassing menthol (non-capsule) cigarettes, which also continued to be high in many regions. There is a need for increased efforts to address flavors and novel tobacco products, features that are known to appeal to youth.","['cigarette market share', 'flavor capsule cigarettes', 'global tobacco control', 'menthol']"
ehealth literacy and health literacy among immigrants and their descendants compared with women of Danish origin: a cross-sectional study using a multidimensional approach among pregnant women.,"To explore ehealth literacy, ability to actively engage with healthcare providers and health system navigation among pregnant immigrant women and their descendants compared with women of Danish origin.A cross-sectional survey at antenatal clinics in 2016, Denmark.Pregnant women attending antenatal care (n=405).The eHealth Literacy Questionnaire (eHLQ) and two domains from the Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ): ability to actively engage with healthcare providers and health system navigation. Range of response options for eHLQ (1-4) and HLQ (1-5). With mixed-effect linear regressions, eHLQ and HLQ among immigrants and their descendants compared with women of Danish origin were assessed.The response rate was 75%. The overall trend was lower ehealth literacy and HLQ domains among immigrants and their descendants compared with women of Danish origin. For ehealth literacy, the results suggest that challenges related more to digital abilities than motivation, trust and access to technology. The mean ability to engage with digital services was 3.20 (SD 0.44) for women of Danish origin. Non-Western descendants (-0.14, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.02), non-Western (-0.20, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.06) and Western (-0.22, 95% CI -0.39 to -0.06) immigrants had lower adjusted means of this outcome. No differences in motivation to engage with digital services were found for descendants (-0.00, 95% CI -0.17 to 0.17), non-Western (0.03, 95% CI -0.11 to 0.18) or Western (-0.06, 95% CI -0.23 to 0.10) immigrants compared with the mean of the reference (2.85, SD 0.45). Lower ability to engage with healthcare providers was found for non-Western born immigrants (-0.15, CI 95% -0.30 to -0.01) compared with the mean of women with Danish origin (4.15, SD 0.47).Generally, descendant and immigrant women had lower levels of ehealth literacy and health literacy than women of Danish origin. These differences are potentially antecedents of adverse birth outcomes and could inform structural efforts to mitigate health inequalities.","['epidemiology', 'health informatics', 'perinatology', 'preventive medicine', 'public health', 'quality in healthcare']"
Miniaturized extracorporeal circulation versus off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Controversies exist whether off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) is superior to miniaturized extracorporeal circulation (MECC) in reducing deleterious effects of cardiopulmonary bypass as only a number of smaller randomized controlled trials (RCT) currently provide a limited evidence base. The main purpose of conducting the present meta-analysis was to overcome the expected low power in RCTs in an attempt to establish whether MECC is comparable to OPCAB.A MEDLINE/PubMed search was conducted to identify eligible RCTs. A pooled summary effect estimate was calculated by means of Mantel-Haenszel method.The search yielded 7 RCTs included in this meta-analysis enrolling 271 patients in the OPCAB group and 279 in the MECC group. The OPCAB and MECC groups were comparable in terms of incidence of in-hospital mortality (Risk Difference [RD] 0.01; 95%CI -0.02, 0.03; P = 0.55; I(2) = 0%), stroke (RD -0.01; 95%CI -0.05, 0.04; P = 0.69; I(2) = 0%), need for renal replacement therapy (RD 0.00; -0.06, 0.06; P = 1; I(2) = 0%), postoperative atrial fibrillation (RD -0.03; -0.17, 0.10; P = 0.64; I(2) = 0%), re-exploration for bleeding (RD -0.01; 95%CI -0.03, 0.02; P = 0.65; I(2) = 0%), transfusion rate (RD -0.01; 95%CI -0.03, 0.02; P = 0.65; I(2) = 0%) and the amount of blood loss (weighted mean difference -25 mL; 95%CI -71, 21; P = 0.28; I(2) = 0%).Using a meta-analytic approach, MECC achieves clinical results comparable to OPCAB including postoperative blood loss and blood transfusion requirement. On the basis of our findings, MECC should be considered as a valid alternative to OPCAB in order to reduce surgical morbidity of conventional cardiopulmonary bypass.","['Metaanalysis', 'Minimized extracorporeal circulation', 'Offpump coronary artery bypass grafting']"
Genomic heritability and correlation between carcass traits in Japanese Black cattle evaluated under different ceilings of relatedness among individuals.,"The investigation of carcass traits to produce meat with high efficiency has been in focus on Japanese Black cattle since 1972. To implement a successful breeding program in carcass production, a comprehensive understanding of genetic characteristics and relationships between the traits is of paramount importance. In this study, genomic heritability and genomic correlation between carcass traits, including carcass weight (CW), rib eye area (REA), rib thickness (RT), subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT), yield rate (YI), and beef marbling score (BMS) were estimated using the genomic data of 9,850 Japanese Black cattle (4,142 heifers and 5,708 steers). In addition, we investigated the effect of genetic relatedness degree on the estimation of genetic parameters of carcass traits in sub-populations created based on different GRM-cutoff values. Genome-based restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) analysis was applied to estimate genetic parameters. Using all animal data, the heritability values for carcass traits were estimated as moderate to relatively high magnitude, ranging from 0.338 to 0.509 with standard errors, ranging from 0.014 to 0.015. The genetic correlations were obtained low and negative between SFT and REA [-0.198 (0.034)] and between SFT and BMS [-0.096 (0.033)] traits, and high and negative between SFT and YI [-0.634 (0.022)]. REA trait was genetically highly correlated with YI and BMS [0.811 (0.012) and 0.625 (0.022), respectively]. In sub-populations created based on the genetic-relatedness ceiling, the heritability estimates ranged from 0.212 (0.131) to 0.647 (0.066). At the genetic-relatedness ceiling of 0.15, the correlation values between most traits with low genomic correlation were overestimated while the correlations between the traits with relatively moderate to high correlations, ranging from 0.380 to 0.811, were underestimated. The values were steady at the ceilings of 0.30-0.95 (sample size of 5,443-9,850) for most of the highly correlated traits. The results demonstrated that there is considerable genetic variation and also favorable genomic correlations between carcass traits. Therefore, the genetic improvement for the traits can be simultaneously attained through genomic selection. In addition, we observed that depending on the degree of relationship between individuals and sample size, the genomic heritability and correlation estimates for carcass traits may be different.","['Japanese Black cattle', 'carcass traits', 'degree of relationship', 'genomic correlation', 'genomic heritability']"
Age and gender-specific reference intervals for a panel of lysophosphatidylcholines estimated by tandem mass spectrometry in dried blood spots.,"Very long-chain fatty acyl-lysophosphatidylcholines (VLCFA-LysoPCs) are measured in dried blood spots (DBS) for identifying X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) and other inherited peroxisomal disorders. Our study aimed to establish age- and gender-specific reference intervals for a panel of LysoPCs measured by tandem mass spectrometry in DBS.LysoPCs (26:0-, 24:0-, 22:0- and 20:0-LysoPCs) were estimated by flow injection analysis-tandem mass spectrometry (FIA-MS/MS) and liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) methods in 3.2 mm blood spots of 2689 anonymized, putative normal subjects (1375 males, and 1314 females) aged between 2 days and 65 years. Samples were divided into groups: Neonates (0-1month), Infants (>1m-1year), Children and Adolescents (>1-18years), and Adults (>18years). Reference intervals were determined using the percentile approach and represented as the median with the 1<sup>st</sup> and 99<sup>th</sup> percentile lower and upper limits.The percentage coefficient of variation (CV) for repeatability assays of internal and external quality control samples were within acceptable limits. Significant differences (P <0.0001, P <0.01) were observed in the concentrations of 26:0-, 24:0-, 22:0- and 20:0-LysoPCs and their ratios, 26:0/22:0-, 24:0/22:0-, 26:0/20:0-and 24:0/20:0-LysoPC in neonates and infants when compared to children, adolescents, and adults. Levels of 26:0-, 24:0- and 22:0-LysoPCs decreased, whereas 20:0-LysoPC increased with age. There were no significant gender-based differences in the concentration of LysoPCs.We established age- and gender-specific reference intervals for a panel of LysoPCs in DBS. These reference values would be helpful when interpreting LysoPC values in DBS during screening for X-ALD and other peroxisomal disorders.","['Dried blood spots', 'Lysophosphatidylcholines', 'Reference intervals', 'Tandem mass spectrometry']"
"Exploration of variance, autocorrelation, and skewness of deviations from lactation curves as resilience indicators for breeding.","The ability of a cow to cope with environmental disturbances, such as pathogens or heat waves, is called resilience. To improve resilience through breeding, we need resilience indicators, which could be based on the fluctuation patterns in milk yield resulting from disturbances. The aim of this study was to explore 3 traits that describe fluctuations in milk yield as indicators for breeding resilient cows: the variance, autocorrelation, and skewness of the deviations from individual lactation curves. We used daily milk yield records of 198,754 first-parity cows, recorded by automatic milking systems. First, we estimated a lactation curve for each cow using 4 different methods: moving average, moving median, quantile regression, and Wilmink curve. We then calculated the log-transformed variance (LnVar), lag-1 autocorrelation (r<sub>auto</sub>), and skewness (Skew) of the daily deviations from these curves as resilience indicators. A genetic analysis of the resilience indicators was performed, and genetic correlations between resilience indicators and health, longevity, fertility, metabolic, and production traits were estimated. The heritabilities differed between LnVar (0.20 to 0.24), r<sub>auto</sub> (0.08 to 0.10), and Skew (0.01 to 0.02), and the genetic correlations among the indicators were weak to moderate. For r<sub>auto</sub> and Skew, genetic correlations with health, longevity, fertility, and metabolic traits were weak or the opposite of what we expected. Therefore, r<sub>auto</sub> and Skew have limited value as resilience indicators. However, lower LnVar was genetically associated with better udder health (genetic correlations from -0.22 to -0.32), better longevity (-0.28 to -0.34), less ketosis (-0.27 to -0.33), better fertility (-0.06 to -0.17), higher BCS (-0.29 to -0.40), and greater dry matter intake (-0.53 to -0.66) at the same level of milk yield. These correlations support LnVar as an indicator of resilience. Of all 4 curve-fitting methods, LnVar based on quantile regression systematically had the strongest genetic correlations with health, longevity, and fertility traits. Thus, quantile regression is considered the best curve-fitting method. In conclusion, LnVar based on deviations from a quantile regression curve is a promising resilience indicator that can be used to breed cows that are better at coping with disturbances.","['automatic milking system', 'dairy cow', 'milk yield', 'resilience', 'variance']"
Outflow Facility in Tube Shunt Fenestration.,"Determination of the effect of varying fenestration technique, and simulated patch graft on outflow facility for Baerveldt tube.Silicone tubing similar to Baerveldt implant (AMO, Santa Ana, CA) with different fenestrations techniques was connected to a digital manometer in a closed system with a fluid-filled syringe on a stand to adjust pressure. The venting slits included: (A) 4 piercings with 7-0 TG140-8 needle; (B) a 2-mm slit with a 15° blade; (C) 4 piercings with a 15° blade; (D) 9-0 Nylon on CS140-6 needle with suture stenting the fenestration.For pressures of 10, 20, 30, 40 mm Hg in groups A to D, the average outflow facility (mL/min/mm Hg) were group A: 0.11, 0.20, 0.28, 0.40; group B: 0.30, 0.69, 0.98, 0.93; group C: 0.73, 0.80, 0.81, 0.88; group D: 0.58, 0.65, 0.80, 0.87. For external compression with 10 gram weights at pressures of 10, 20, 30, 40 mm Hg, outflow were group A: 0.0, 0.18, 0.20, 0.53; group B: 0.75, 0.70, 0.97, 1.21. Group C: 0.18, 0.03, 0.57, 0.04. Group D: 0.73, 0.90, 1.13, 0.91.Effectivity of venting slits in maintaining adequate IOP in the early postoperative period for non-valved glaucoma implant is variable, multifactorial and largely intraocular pressure (IOP) dependent.This study explores methods of producing fenestration and the effects on outflow at different pressures in an attempt to determine which fenestration technique has more reproducible results that can be made applicable in clinical practice. This is also the first study to evaluate the effect of external pressures similar to scleral patch graft on the tube fenestrations.Olayanju J, Borras T, Qaqish B, Fleischman D.

A nomogram based on radiomics intermuscular adipose analysis to indicate arteriosclerosis in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.,"Early identifying arteriosclerosis in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients could contribute to choosing proper subjects for early prevention. Here, we aimed to investigate whether radiomic intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT) analysis could be used as a novel marker to indicate arteriosclerosis in newly diagnosed T2D patients.A total of 549 patients with newly diagnosed T2D were included in this study. The clinical information of the patients was recorded and the carotid plaque burden was used to indicate arteriosclerosis. Three models were constructed to evaluate the risk of arteriosclerosis: a clinical model, a radiomics model (a model based on IMAT analysis proceeded on chest CT images), and a clinical-radiomics combined model (a model that integrated clinical-radiological features). The performance of the three models were compared using the area under the curve (AUC) and DeLong test. Nomograms were constructed to indicate arteriosclerosis presence and severity. Calibration curves and decision curves were plotted to evaluate the clinical benefit of using the optimal model.The AUC for indicating arteriosclerosis of the clinical-radiomics combined model was higher than that of the clinical model [0.934 (0.909, 0.959) vs. 0.687 (0.634, 0.730), <i>P</i> < 0.001 in the training set, 0.933 (0.898, 0.969) vs. 0.721 (0.642, 0.799), <i>P</i> < 0.001 in the validation set]. Similar indicative efficacies were found between the clinical-radiomics combined model and radiomics model (<i>P</i> = 0.5694). The AUC for indicating the severity of arteriosclerosis of the combined clinical-radiomics model was higher than that of both the clinical model and radiomics model [0.824 (0.765, 0.882) vs. 0.755 (0.683, 0.826) and 0.734 (0.663, 0.805), <i>P</i> < 0.001 in the training set, 0.717 (0.604, 0.830) vs. 0.620 (0.490, 0.750) and 0.698 (0.582, 0.814), <i>P</i> < 0.001 in the validation set, respectively]. The decision curve showed that the clinical-radiomics combined model and radiomics model indicated a better performance than the clinical model in indicating arteriosclerosis. However, in indicating severe arteriosclerosis, the clinical-radiomics combined model had higher efficacy than the other two models.Radiomics IMAT analysis could be a novel marker for indicating arteriosclerosis in patients with newly diagnosed T2D. The constructed nomograms provide a quantitative and intuitive way to assess the risk of arteriosclerosis, which may help clinicians comprehensively analyse radiomics characteristics and clinical risk factors more confidently.","['CT', 'arteriosclerosis', 'newly diagnosed diabetes', 'nomogram', 'radiomics']"
Validation of translated Obstetric Quality of Recovery (ObsQoR-10A) score after nonelective cesarean delivery (CD) in an Arabic-speaking population.,"The ObsQoR-11 is a validated scale that assesses recovery after cesarean delivery (CD). This observational study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of its Arabic version.The original ObsQoR-11 was translated into an Arabic version (ObsQoR-10A). All participants completed the ObsQoR-10A at 24 h and 48 h postoperatively after CD. Validity, reliability, responsiveness, and feasibility were assessed.The ObsQoR-10A correlated with Global Health Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) at 24 h (<i>R</i> = 0.68, 95% CI: 0.56-0.80, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and at 48 h (<i>R</i> = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.54-0.78, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and differentiated between good and poor recovery (median scores at 24 h 88 vs. 71, <i>P</i> < 0.001; at 48 h 95.5 vs. 70, <i>P</i> < 0.001). ObsQoR-10A correlated with hospital length of stay at 24 h (<i>R</i> = -0.21, 95% CI: -0.40 to -0.02, <i>P</i> = 0.03) and at 48 h (<i>R</i> = -0.21, 95% CI: -0.40 to -0.03, <i>P</i> = 0.02); gestational age at 24 h (<i>R</i> = 0.22, 95% CI: 0.03-0.40, <i>P</i> = 0.02); change in hemoglobin at 24 h (<i>R</i> = -0.30, 95% CI: 0.51 to -0.10, <i>P</i> < 0.01); and total opioids at 48 h (<i>R</i> = -0.45, 95% CI: -0.62 to -0.27, <i>P</i> < 0.001). There was a significant difference between 24 h and 48 h postoperative ObsQoR-10A scores (median difference: -18; <i>P</i> < 0.001 which shows responsiveness). Other key measures included a Cronbach's alpha of 0.87, split-half 0.75, and intra-class correlation >0.62 with no floor or ceiling effects. Median (IQR) completion time was 3 (3-5) and 3 (2.5-3.5) minutes at 24 h and 48 h.ObsQoR-10A is a valid, reliable, responsive, and a clinically feasible tool in an Arabic-speaking obstetric population.","['Cesarean delivery', 'ObsQoR', 'patientreported outcome measure', 'postoperative', 'quality of recover']"
Chinese Herbal Medicine for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus With Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"<b>Objectives:</b> To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with current evidence. <b>Methods:</b> This study was registered in PROSPERO as CRD42021271488. A literature search was conducted in eight electronic databases from inception to December 2021. The primary outcomes were lipid indices and liver functions, including triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase (AST). Review Manager 5.2 and Stata v14.0 were applied for analysis. <b>Results:</b> The research enrolled 18 RCTs with 1,463 participants. Results showed CHM combined with western medicine (WM) was more effective than WM alone in TG (weighted mean differences (WMD) = -0.35.95% confidence interval (CI) [-0.51, -0.19], <i>p</i> < 0.0001), TC (WMD = -0.58.95%CI [-0.80, -0.36], <i>p</i> < 0.00001), LDL-C (WMD = -0.37, 95%CI [-0.47, -0.26], <i>p</i> < 0.00001), HDL-C (WMD = 0.20, 95%CI [0.10, 0.29], <i>p</i> < 0.0001), ALT (WMD = -4.99, 95%CI [-6.64, -3.33], <i>p</i> < 0.00001), AST (WMD = -4.76, 95%CI [-6.35, -3.16], <i>p</i> < 0.00001), homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance (WMD = -1.01, 95%CI [-1.22, -0.79], <i>p</i> < 0.00001), fasting blood glucose (WMD = -0.87, 95%CI [-1.13, -0.61], <i>p</i> < 0.00001), 2-h postprandial glucose (WMD = -1.45.95%CI [-2.00, -0.91], <i>p</i> < 0.00001), body mass index (WMD = -0.73.95%CI [-1.35, -0.12], <i>p</i> = 0.02), and overall effective rate (risk ratio (RR) = 1.37.95%CI [1.29, 1.46], <i>p</i> < 0.00001). <b>Conclusion:</b> The CHM in combination with WM seems to be more beneficial in T2DM with NAFLD patients in improving lipid and glucose metabolism, liver function, and insulin resistance as well as improving overall efficiency and reducing body weight. Given the poor quality of reports from these studies and uncertain evidence, these findings should be interpreted cautiously. <b>Systematic Review Registration:</b> https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42021271488, identifier CRD42021271488.","['Chinese herbal medicine CHM', 'metaanalysis', 'nonalcoholic fatty liver diseaseNAFLD', 'systematic review', 'type 2 diabetes mellitusT2DM']"
Correlates and aetiological factors associated with hedonic well-being among an ageing population of US men and women: secondary data analysis of a national survey.,"To understand the gender-specific factors that uniquely contribute to successful ageing in a US population of men and women, 57-85 years of age. This was achieved through the examination of the correlates of subjective well-being defined by health-related quality of life (HRQoL), across several biological and psychosocial determinants of health.Cross-sectional study.The National Social Life, Health and Ageing Project (NSHAP), 2010-2011 a representative sample of the US population.3377 adults aged 57-85 (1538 men, 1839 women) from the NSHAP.The biopsychosocial factors of biological/physiological function, symptom status, functional status, general health perceptions and HRQoL happiness.HRQoL was measured using the NSHAP wave 2 multistage, stratified area probability sample of US households (n=3377). Variable selection was guided by the Wilson and Cleary model (WCM) that classifies health outcomes at five main levels and characteristics.Our findings indicate differences in biopsychosocial factors comprised in the WCM and their relative importance and unique impact on HRQoL by gender. Women reported significantly lower HRQoL than men (t=3.5, df=3366). The most significant contributors to HRQoL in women were mental health (B=0.31; 0.22, 0.39), loneliness (B=-0.26; -0.35, -0.17), urinary incontinence (B=-0.22; -0.40, -0.05) and support from spouse/partner (B=0.27; 0.10, 0.43) and family B=0.12; 0.03, 0.20). Men indicated mental health (B=0.21; 0.14, 0.29), physical health (B=0.17; 0.10, 0.23), functional difficulties (B=0.38; 0.10, 0.65), loneliness (B=-0.20; -0.26, -0.12), depression (B=-0.36; -0.58, -0.15) and support from friends (B=0.06; 0.10, 0.11) as significant contributors. Those with greater social support had better HRQoL (F=4.22, df=4). Lack of companionship and reliance on spouse/partner were significant HRQoL contributors in both groups.Our findings offer insight into ageing, gender and subjective well-being. The results provide an opportunity to identify biopsychosocial factors to inform interventions to support successful ageing.","['aging', 'gender differences', 'healthrelated quality of life', 'wellbeing']"
The impact of COVID-19 on organ donation and transplantation in the UK: lessons learned from the first year of the pandemic.,"The COVID-19 pandemic had a major impact on UK deceased organ donation and transplantation activity. We used national audit data from NHS Blood and Transplant to explore in detail the effects of the pandemic in comparison with 12 months pre-pandemic, and to consider the impact of the mitigating strategies and challenges placed on ICU by 'waves' of patients with COVID-19. Between 11 March 2020 and 10 March 2021, referrals to NHS Blood and Transplant of potential organ donors were initially inversely related to the number of people with COVID-19 undergoing mechanical ventilation in intensive care (incident rate ratio (95%CI) per 1000 patients 0.93 (0.88-0.99), p = 0.018), although this pattern reversed during the second wave (additional incident rate ratio (95%CI) 1.12 (1.05-1.19), p < 0.001). Adjusted numbers of donors (incident rate ratio (95%CI) 0.71 (0.61-0.81), p < 0.001) and organs retrieved (incident rate ratio (95%CI) 0.89 (0.82-0.97), p = 0.007) were inversely dependent on COVID-19 workload, though weekly numbers of transplants were unrelated (incident rate ratio (95%CI) 0.95 (0.86-1.04), p = 0.235). Non-COVID-19 mortality fell from 15,007 to 14,087 during the first wave (rate ratio (95%CI) 0.94 (0.92-0.96), p < 0.001) but climbed from 18,907 to 19,372 during the second wave (rate ratio (95%CI) 1.02 (1.00-1.05), p = 0.018). There were fewer in-hospital deaths from cardiac arrest and intracranial catastrophes throughout (rate ratio (95%CI) 0.83 (0.81-0.86), p < 0.001 and rate ratio (95%CI) 0.88 (0.85-0.91), p < 0.001, respectively). There were overall fewer eligible donors (n = 4282) when compared with pre-pandemic levels (n = 6038); OR (95%CI) 0.58 (0.51-0.66), p < 0.001. The total number of donations during the year fell from 1620 to 1140 (rate ratio (95%CI) 0.70 (0.65-0.76), p < 0.001), but the proportion of eligible donors who proceeded to donation (27%) was unchanged (OR (95%CI) 0.99 (0.91-1.08), p = 0.821). The reduction in donations and transplantation during the pandemic was multifactorial, but these data highlight the impact in the UK of a fall in eligible donors and an inverse relationship of referrals to COVID-19 workload. Despite the challenges faced, the foundations underpinning the UK deceased organ donation programme remained strong.","['COVID19', 'emergency preparedness', 'organ donation', 'resilience', 'transplant']"
Dietary Fiber Intake and Metabolic Syndrome Risk Factors among Young South African Adults.,"This study attempts to bridge the research gap regarding the importance of dietary fiber in reducing metabolic syndrome (MetS) risk factors in young rural South Africans. A total of 627 individuals (309 males and 318 females) aged 18&ndash;30 years participated in the study. Dietary intake was measured using a validated 24-h recall method. The consumption of different types of dietary fiber (total, soluble, and insoluble) was calculated and presented as grams. Anthropometrics, blood pressure, fasting blood glucose, and lipid profiles were measured according to standard protocols. According to the definition of the International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the prevalence of MetS was 23.1%. Overall, the total median [interquartile range (IQR)] values for total, insoluble, and soluble fiber consumed were 4.6 g [0.0&ndash;48.9], 0.0 g [0.0&ndash;18.0], and 0.0 g [0.0&ndash;15.0], respectively. Females had a higher median [IQR] intake of total (5.1 g [0.0&ndash;48.9] vs. 4.3 g [0.0&ndash;43.9]), insoluble (0.0 g [0.0&ndash;18.0] vs. 0.0 g [0.0&ndash;12.0]), and soluble fiber (0.0 g [0.0&ndash;14.9] vs. 0.0 g [0.0&ndash;7.3]) than males, respectively. The mean values for waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, and total cholesterol were higher in females than males (82.20 cm vs. 75.07 cm; 5.59 mmol/L vs. 5.44 mmol/L; and 4.26 mmol/L vs. 4.03 mmol/L, respectively), with significant differences observed for waist circumference and total cholesterol (<i>p</i> < 0.001 and <i>p</i> = 0.005, respectively). More than 97% of participants had fiber intakes below the recommended levels. After adjusting for all potential confounders (age, gender, and energy), log total fiber was inversely associated with fasting blood glucose (&beta; = &minus;0.019, 95% CI [&minus;0.042 to 0.003], <i>p</i> < 0.05), systolic blood pressure (&beta; = &minus;0.002, 95% CI [&minus;0.050 to 0.002], <i>p</i> < 0.05) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (&beta; = &minus;0.085, 95% CI [&minus;0.173 to 0.002], <i>p</i> = 0.051) This study may be of public health relevance, providing a potential link between less dietary fiber intake and fasting blood glucose (FBG) and both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Therefore, this observational data encourages public health policy measures to increase the consumption of dietary fiber in rural communities in order to lower the burden of MetS and its associated risk factors.","['blood pressure', 'fiber intake', 'metabolic syndrome', 'rural population']"
"Alcohol Consumption and Adiposity: A Longitudinal Analysis of 45,399 UK Biobank Participants.","The evidence on the association between alcohol consumption and adiposity is inconsistent and fragmented. We investigated the longitudinal association between alcohol consumption pattern and four different adiposity markers with repeated measures of adiposity and obesity incidence. We categorized current drinkers based on the sex-specific quartiles of their weekly alcohol consumption and the UK alcohol drinking guidelines. We used multivariable adjusted generalised linear models. With the exception of a direct association between alcohol volume and body fat percentage (BF%) in women (B = 0.42%; 95%CI: 0.04, 0.80% for women in the top quartile), we found no associations between alcohol consumption and adiposity markers for either sex. Red wine and champagne/white wine consumption were inversely associated with waist circumference (WC) for both sexes (B = -0.58 cm, 95%CI: -0.77, -0.38 cm and B= -0.49 cm, 95%CI: -0.68, -0.29 cm, respectively, for women; B = -0.28 cm, 95%CI: -0.47, -0.08 cm and B = -0.23 cm, 95%CI: -0.42, -0.04 cm, respectively, for men). Female and male spirit drinkers had higher WC than non-spirit drinkers. Alcohol consumption was associated with a lower risk of obesity incidence in women (OR:0.60, 95%CI:0.45, 0.80 for the 2nd quartile, OR:0.53, 95%CI: 0.40, 0.70 for the 3rd quartile and OR:0.61, 95%CI:0.46, 0.80 for the 4th quartile). We found limited evidence of longitudinal associations between alcohol intake and adiposity. The few statistically significant associations we observed are unlikely to be of clinical importance.","['adiposity', 'alcohol', 'body fat percentage', 'body mass index', 'waist circumference', 'waist to hip ratio']"
"DeepLN: A Multi-Task AI Tool to Predict the Imaging Characteristics, Malignancy and Pathological Subtypes in CT-Detected Pulmonary Nodules.","Distinction of malignant pulmonary nodules from the benign ones based on computed tomography (CT) images can be time-consuming but significant in routine clinical management. The advent of artificial intelligence (AI) has provided an opportunity to improve the accuracy of cancer risk prediction.A total of 8950 detected pulmonary nodules with complete pathological results were retrospectively enrolled. The different radiological manifestations were identified mainly as various nodules densities and morphological features. Then, these nodules were classified into benign and malignant groups, both of which were subdivided into finer specific pathological types. Here, we proposed a deep convolutional neural network for the assessment of lung nodules named DeepLN to identify the radiological features and predict the pathologic subtypes of pulmonary nodules.In terms of density, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) of DeepLN were 0.9707 (95% confidence interval, CI: 0.9645-0.9765), 0.7789 (95%CI: 0.7569-0.7995), and 0.8950 (95%CI: 0.8822-0.9088) for the pure-ground glass opacity (pGGO), mixed-ground glass opacity (mGGO) and solid nodules. As for the morphological features, the AUCs were 0.8347 (95%CI: 0.8193-0.8499) and 0.9074 (95%CI: 0.8834-0.9314) for spiculation and lung cavity respectively. For the identification of malignant nodules, our DeepLN algorithm achieved an AUC of 0.8503 (95%CI: 0.8319-0.8681) in the test set. Pertaining to predicting the pathological subtypes in the test set, the multi-task AUCs were 0.8841 (95%CI: 0.8567-0.9083) for benign tumors, 0.8265 (95%CI: 0.8004-0.8499) for inflammation, and 0.8022 (95%CI: 0.7616-0.8445) for other benign ones, while AUCs were 0.8675 (95%CI: 0.8525-0.8813) for lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), 0.8792 (95%CI: 0.8640-0.8950) for squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC), 0.7404 (95%CI: 0.7031-0.7782) for other malignant ones respectively in the malignant group.The DeepLN based on deep learning algorithm represented a competitive performance to predict the imaging characteristics, malignancy and pathologic subtypes on the basis of non-invasive CT images, and thus had great possibility to be utilized in the routine clinical workflow.","['artificial intelligence', 'computed tomography', 'deep learning', 'pathological subtypes', 'pulmonary nodules']"
Diagnostic performance of clusterin in hepatocellular carcinoma: A meta-analysis.,"Clusterin (CLU) is a pleiotropic protein with numerous functions. It has recently attracted considerable attention owing to its association with cancer progression and metastasis. However, its role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been investigated. This meta-analysis is the first evaluation of the diagnostic performance of CLU in HCC.Articles published in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Wanfang Data Knowledge Service Platform, and China Science and Technology Journal Database until January 2022 were searched. Studies that reported the usefulness of CLU for the differentiation of HCC and non-HCC (e.g., liver cirrhosis, chronic hepatitis, and other benign liver disease) patients were selected. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) was used as a positive control in this study. The sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) were compared between CLU and AFP.Eight articles including 811 participants were included. The pooled sensitivity (95% confidence interval (CI)), specificity (95% CI), DOR (95% CI), and AUC (95% CI) were: 0.86 (0.78-0.91), 0.85 (0.75-0.91), 35 (13-94), and 0.92 (0.89-0.94) for CLU; 0.74 (0.67-0.81), 0.89 (0.79-0.94), 22 (8-61), and 0.87 (0.84-0.90) for AFP; 0.93 (0.88-0.96), 0.85 (0.68-0.94), 75 (21-262), and 0.95 (0.92-0.96) for CLU + AFP, respectively. Compared with AFP, CLU showed higher sensitivity, DOR, and AUC, as well as similar specificity. The combination of CLU and AFP resulted in higher sensitivity, DOR, and AUC.Serum CLU is a better biomarker versus AFP for the diagnosis of HCC. The combination of CLU and AFP improved diagnostic performance.","['clusterin', 'diagnosis', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'metaanalysis', 'tumor marker']"
Vision tests on spectacle lenses and contact lenses for optical myopia correction: a pilot study.,"Visual performance and short-term tolerability of different designs of myopia correcting options, including therapeutically relevant bifocal contact lenses (CL) and spectacle lenses with 'defocus incorporated multiple segments (DIMS)' technology were compared.In myopic volunteering subjects (n=8; spherical equivalent range: -1 to -7 D) visual acuity (VA) using Landolt C and contrast sensitivity (CS) using contrast C were assessed at three different gaze positions (-22° nasal, +22° temporal and 0° central), corresponding to a gaze through the DIMS area or the clear area of the DIMS lens design, respectively, after short-term wear of each of single vision spectacle lenses (SV), DIMS spectacle lenses (DIMS), monofocal soft CL and centre-near multifocal soft CL (MCL). Also, CS was assessed under photopic and mesopic light conditions with and without glare using sinusoidal gratings at 1.5, 3, 6, 12 and 18 cpd.Mean VA (Landolt C) was -0.12 to -0.10, -0.05 and 0.10 logMAR (SV, DIMS, CL, MCL) at central gaze (0°). At nasal gaze (-22°), VA differed by 0.12, 0.33, 0.05 and 0.01, and at temporal gaze (+22°) by 0.05, 0.26, 0 and -0.08 compared with central gaze values. Mean CS (Contrast C) was 1.74, 1.73, 1.69 and 1.61 logCS (SV, DIMS, CL, MCL) at central gaze at nasal gaze, CS differed by -0.02 to -0.13, -0.01 and -0.01, and at temporal gaze by -0.02 to -0.16, -0.01 and +0.06 compared with central gaze values.When compared with SV, MCL leads to a general decrease in VA and CS, while DIMS did not differ from SV at straight gaze (0° gaze). With DIMS, VA and CS are decreased to a similar level as with the MCL, but only at nasal and temporal gaze.","['Contact lens', 'Optics and Refraction', 'Treatment other', 'Vision']"
Early Prediction of Refractory Epilepsy in Children Under Artificial Intelligence Neural Network.,"In order to realize the early prediction of refractory epilepsy in children, data preprocessing technology was used to improve the data quality, and the detection model of refractory epilepsy in children based on convolutional neural network (CNN) was established. Then, the data in the epilepsy electroencephalography (EEG) signal public data set was used for model training and the diagnosis of refractory epilepsy in children. Moreover, back propagation neural network (BPNN), support vector machine (SVM), XGBoost, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT), AdaBoost algorithm were introduced for comparison. The results showed that the early prediction accuracy of BP, SVM, XGBoost, GBDT, AdaBoost, and the algorithm in this study for refractory epilepsy in children were 0.745, 0.778, 0.885, 0.846, 0.874, and 0.941, respectively. The sensitivities were 0.81, 0.826, 0.822, 0.84, 0.859, and 0.918, respectively. The specificities were 0.683, 0.696, 0.743, 0.792, 0.84, and 0.905, respectively. The accuracy was 0.707, 0.732, 0.765, 0.802, 0.839, and 0.881, respectively. The recall rates were 0.69, 0.716, 0.753, 0.784, 0.813, and 0.877, respectively. F1 scores were 0.698, 0.724, 0.759, 0.793, 0.826, and 0.879, respectively. Through the comparisons of the above six indicators, the algorithm proposed in this study was significantly higher than other algorithms, suggesting that the proposed algorithm was more accurate in early prediction of refractory epilepsy in children. Analysis of the EEG characteristics and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of refractory epilepsy in children suggested that the MRI images of patients' brains under this algorithm had obvious characteristics. The reason for the prediction error of the algorithm was that the duration of epilepsy was too short or the EEG of the patient didn't change notably during the epileptic seizure. In summary, the prediction method of refractory epilepsy in children based on CNN was accurate, which had broad adoption prospects in assisting clinicians in the examination and diagnosis of refractory epilepsy in children.","['EEG', 'MRI', 'convolutional neural network', 'disease prediction', 'refractory epilepsy in children']"
Social Support and Suicide Risk Among Chinese University Students: A Mental Health Perspective.,"<b>Background:</b> World Health Organization recognizes suicide as a public health priority. This study aimed to investigate the risk life events which led university students to consider suicide and explore the protective mechanism of social support (including subjective support, objective support, and support utilization) on suicide risk. <b>Methods:</b> Three thousand nine hundred and seventy-two university students were recruited in Harbin, China. Social Support Rating Scale, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, the Beck Depression Inventory, and the 25-item scale of suicide acceptability were used to collect participants' information. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation, and mediation analysis were employed for statistical analysis. <b>Results:</b> ""Drug addict,"" ""infected with HIV,"" and ""incurable illness"" were the top three events that led university students to consider suicide. Social support played an important protective role against suicide risk. Subjective support and support utilization had total effects on suicide acceptability, including direct and indirect effects. Anxiety (indirect effect = -0.022, 95% CI = -0.037 ~ -0.009) and depressive symptoms (indirect effect = -0.197, 95% CI = -0.228 ~ -0.163) mediated the relationship between subjective support and suicide acceptability; meanwhile, the association between support utilization and suicide acceptability was mediated by anxiety (indirect effect = -0.054, 95% CI = -0.088 ~ -0.024) and depressive symptoms (indirect effect = -0.486, 95% CI = -0.558 ~ -0.422). However, the protective impact of objective support worked totally through decreasing anxiety (indirect effect = -0.018, 95% CI = -0.035 ~ -0.006) and depressive symptoms (indirect effect = -0.196, 95% CI = -0.246 ~ -0.143). Moreover, the mediation effects of depressive symptoms had stronger power than anxiety in the impact of social support on suicide risk. <b>Conclusions:</b> Among Chinese university students, suicide acceptability was elevated when there was a health scare. Social support effectively reduced suicide risk <i>via</i> decreasing anxiety and depressive symptoms. From the mental health perspective, families, peers, teachers, and communities should work together to establish a better social support system for university students, if necessary, help them to seek professional psychological services.","['anxiety', 'depressive symptoms', 'social support', 'suicide risk', 'university students']"
Standard Gamble to Derive Utility Health States for Limbal Stem Cell Deficiency.,"To generate UK health-related quality-of-life (HRQoL) data for adult patients with moderate-to-severe limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD), unilateral or bilateral, due to physical or chemical ocular burns to help inform economic evaluations of treatments.EQ-5D-3L with vision bolt-on scores was prospectively measured for one of five clinical scenarios of LSCD described in vignettes in a demographically representative population of 520 UK adults. These were converted to health state utilities using three different UK value sets. A standard gamble (SG) was then undertaken using 12 SG scenarios to examine the component drivers of health utility for the treatment of LSCD.For the EQ-5D-3L scenarios, the mean disutility for LSCD with poor visual acuity, pain and disfigurement in both eyes compared to one eye was -0.084 (range=-0.156 to -0.045 across the value sets). The mean disutility of bilateral LSCD with pain, disfigurement, and poor visual acuity compared to unilateral LSCD with only poor visual acuity in one eye was -0.104 (range=-0.151 to -0.078). Similarly, where one eye was affected, pain and disfigurement in combination were associated with a greater mean disutility than improvements in visual acuity alone: -0.011 (range=-0.04 to 0.005). Mean SG utilities were within a narrow range (0.682-0.765). Where one eye was affected, the main driver was disfigurement: mean utility was 0.731 (0.709-0.753) compared to 0.682 (0.659-0.704) when disfigurement was removed compared to vision restored to normal. For bilateral LSCD, mean utilities were 0.693 (0.672-0.715) for normal vision and 0.75 (0.73-0.771) when disfigurement and pain were removed.Improvements in pain and disfigurement appeared to be the main factors driving differences in health utilities associated with symptom profiles in LSCD, with improvements in visual acuity having lesser impact.","['LSCD', 'holoclar®', 'limbal stem cell deficiency', 'ocular burns', 'standard gamble', 'utility states']"
Transthoracic ultrasonography in patients with interstitial lung disease.,"Transthoracic ultrasonography (TUS) is suggested as a noninvasive, radiation-free method for the assessment of interstitial lung disease (ILD). This study was designed to study TUS features of ILD. Furthermore, possible correlations of these features with parameters of spirometry, arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis and 6-min walk test (6MWT) were assessed.Fifty patients with ILD were diagnosed based on history, examination, chest X-ray/high-resolution computed tomography, and spirometry. Each patient underwent 6MWT, ABG analysis, and TUS. TUS was also performed on 20 healthy volunteering controls.The TUS features among patients were B pattern in 40 patients (80.0%, P < 0.001), decreased lung sliding in 22 patients (44.0%, P < 0.001), pleural line thickening in 28 patients (56.0%, P < 0.001), pleural line irregularity in 39 patients (78.0%, P < 0.001) and subpleural changes in 22 patients (44.0%, P < 0.01). Increasing pleural line thickness was inversely correlated with forced vital capacity (FVC) percent predicted (r = -0.345, P < 0.05), pO<sub>2</sub> (r = -0.335, P < 0.01), SpO<sub>2</sub> at rest (r = -0.444, P < 0.01), 6-min walk distance (6MWD) (r = -0.554, P < 0.001) and distance-saturation product (DSP) (r = -0.572, P < 0.001). Increasing distance between B lines also correlated inversely with FVC percent predicted (r = -0.278), pO<sub>2</sub> (r = -0.207), SpO<sub>2</sub> at rest (r = -0.170), 6MWD (r = -0.209), and DSP (r = -0.214); however these correlations were not statistically significant (P > 0.05).TUS seems to be a useful imaging method for the diagnosis of ILD. It can be used to estimate the severity of ILD. It is simple, bedside, cost-effective, and radiation-free. It may be especially useful in the follow up of patients in low resource settings, pregnant females, and bed-ridden or unstable patients who cannot be shifted to radiology suite.","['Bpattern', 'interstitial lung disease', 'pleural irregularity', 'transthoracic', 'ultrasonography']"
Tortuosity of the Internal Carotid Artery and Its Clinical Significance in the Development of Aneurysms.,"Tortuosity of blood vessels is a common angiographic finding that may indicate systemic disease and can be correlated with vascular pathologies. In this work, we determined whether patients with and without internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm presented with differences in its tortuosity descriptors. We retrospectively analysed data of 298 patients hospitalized between January 2014 and June 2018. For each patient's imaging data, we extracted a curve representing the ICA course and measured its Relative Length (RL), Sum of Angle Metrics (SOAM), Product of Angle Distance (PAD), Triangular Index (TI), and Inflection Count Metrics (ICM). We found that patients with an ICA aneurysm had significantly lower RL (0.46 ± 0.19 vs. 0.51 ± 0.17; <i>p</i> = 0.023) and significantly higher SOAM (0.39 ± 0.21 vs. 0.32 ± 0.21 <i>p</i> = 0.003), PAD (0.38 ± 0.19 vs. 0.32 ± 0.21; <i>p</i> = 0.011), TI (0.30 ± 0.11 vs. 0.27 ± 0.14; <i>p</i> = 0.034), and ICM (0.30 ± 0.16 vs. 0.22 ± 0.12; <i>p</i> < 0.001). We found that that patients who presented with a subarachnoid hemorrhage had significantly higher PAD (0.46 ± 0.22 vs. 0.35 ± 0.20; <i>p</i> = 0.024). In conclusion, higher tortuosity of ICA is associated with ICA aneurysm presence.","['internal carotid artery', 'intracranial aneurysm', 'tortuosity']"
"Assessing Biosecurity Risks for the Introduction and Spread of Diseases Among Commercial Sheep Properties in New South Wales, Australia, Using Foot-and-Mouth Disease as a Case Study.","Sheep production systems are a major industry in Australia, with a gross value of roughly $4.66 billion; 87.3% of which is attributable to export markets. Exotic diseases such as foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) are a potential threat to the viability of Australia's export market. Previous outbreaks of FMD in developed countries, and challenges in the management of onshore biosecurity, signify the importance of on-farm biosecurity in controlling disease transmission. This study aims to investigate the risk of disease introduction and spread among New South Wales (NSW) sheep properties using FMD as a case study and draw recommendation for the industry. Exposure and partial consequence assessments, using scenario trees and Monte Carlo stochastic modeling, were conducted to identify pathways of introduction and spread and calculate the probabilities of these pathways occurring. Input parameters were estimated from the data obtained during qualitative interviews with producers and scientific literature. According to the reported practices of sheep producers and assuming each pathway was carrying the FMD virus, the exposure assessment estimates the median (5-95%) probability of FMD exposure of sheep on a naive property to be 0.619 (0.541-0.698), 0.151 (0.085-0.239), 0.235 (0.153-0.324), and 0.710 (0.619-0.791) for introduction through new stock, wildlife, carriers (humans, dogs, and vehicles), and neighbors, respectively. The spread assessment estimated the median probability of FMD spreading from an infected sheep property to neighboring enterprises to be 0.603 (0.504-0.698). A similar probability was estimated for spread <i>via</i> wildlife (0.523; 0.404-0.638); and a lower spread probability was estimated for carriers (0.315; 0.171-0.527), sheep movement (0.285; 0.161-0.462), and dead stock (0.168; 0.070-0.312). The sensitivity analysis revealed that the introduction of an FMD-infected sheep was more influential for exposure <i>via</i> new stock than isolation practices. Sharing adjacent boundaries was found to be the most influential factor for exposure and spread between neighboring enterprises, and to a lesser extent, hygiene practices were found to have the most influence on exposure and spread through carriers. To minimize the potential risk of FMD introduction and spread between sheep properties, maintenance of boundary fences, identification of infected animals before introduction to the property, and hygiene and disinfection practices should be improved.","['Australia', 'biosecurity', 'footandmouth disease', 'risk assessment', 'sheep']"
Driverless artificial intelligence framework for the identification of malignant pleural effusion.,"Our study aimed to explore the applicability of deep learning and machine learning techniques to distinguish MPE from BPE. We initially used a retrospective cohort with 726 PE patients to train and test the predictive performances of the driverless artificial intelligence (AI), and then stacked with a deep learning and five machine learning models, namely gradient boosting machine (GBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), extremely randomized trees (XRT), distributed random forest (DRF), and generalized linear models (GLM). Furthermore, a prospective cohort with 172 PE patients was applied to detect the external validity of the predictive models. The area under the curve (AUC) in the training, test and validation set were deep learning (0.995, 0.848, 0.917), GBM (0.981, 0.910, 0.951), XGBoost (0.933, 0.916, 0.935), XRT (0.927, 0.909, 0.963), DRF (0.906, 0.809, 0.969), and GLM (0.898, 0.866, 0.892), respectively. Although the Deep Learning model had the highest AUC in the training set (AUC = 0.995), GBM demonstrated stable and high predictive efficiency in three data sets. The final AI model by stacked ensemble yielded optimal diagnostic performance with AUC of 0.991, 0.912 and 0.953 in the training, test and validation sets, respectively. Using the driverless AI framework based on the routinely collected clinical data could significantly improve diagnostic performance in distinguishing MPE from BPE.","['Artificial intelligence', 'Deep learning', 'Differential diagnosis', 'Machine learning', 'Malignant pleural effusion']"
Variance Components and Genetic Parameters Estimated for Fat and Protein Content in Individual Months of Lactation: The Case of Tsigai Sheep.,"The objective of this study was to assess variance components and genetic parameters for fat and protein content in Tsigai sheep using multivariate animal models in which fat and protein content in individual months of lactation were treated as different traits, and univariate models in which fat and protein content were treated as repeated measures of the same traits. Test day measurements were taken between the second and the seventh month of lactation. The fixed effects were lactation number, litter size and days in milk. The random effects were animal genetic effect and permanent environmental effect of ewe. The effect of flock-year-month of test day measurement was fitted either as a fixed (FYM) or random (fym) effect. Heritabilities for fat content were estimated between 0.06 and 0.17 (FYM fitted) and between 0.06 and 0.11 (fym fitted). Heritabilities for protein content were estimated between 0.15 and 0.23 (FYM fitted) and between 0.10 and 0.18 (fym fitted). For fat content, variance ratios of permanent environmental effect of ewe were estimated between 0.04 and 0.11 (FYM fitted) and between 0.02 and 0.06 (fym fitted). For protein content, variance ratios of permanent environmental effect of ewe were estimated between 0.13 and 0.20 (FYM fitted) and between 0.08 and 0.12 (fym fitted). The proportion of phenotypic variance explained by fym effect ranged from 0.39 to 0.43 for fat content and from 0.25 to 0.36 for protein content. Genetic correlations between individual months of lactation ranged from 0.74 to 0.99 (fat content) and from 0.64 to 0.99 (protein content). Fat content heritabilities estimated with univariate animal models roughly corresponded with heritability estimates from multivariate models: 0.13 (FYM fitted) and 0.07 (fym fitted). Protein content heritabilities estimated with univariate animal models also corresponded with heritability estimates from multivariate models: 0.18 (FYM fitted) and 0.13 (fym fitted).","['Genetic Correlations', 'Heritability', 'Milk Composition', 'Sheep', 'Test Day Model', 'Variance Ratios']"
Association between vitamin E and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: a meta-analysis.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) generally has a relatively favorable clinical course; however, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) was much more frequently progresses to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials to examine the effects of vitamin E supplementation in improving liver histology in NASH. We performed a comprehensive search of the PubMed, Embase and Cochrane databases through October 2014. Weighted mean differences (WMDs) and their respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the efficacy of vitamin E in improving liver histological scores by using fixed effects or random effects. Standard methods were performed to explore statistical heterogeneity and publication bias. Compared with controls, vitamin E supplementation significantly improved all histological parameters, including steatosis (WMD = -0.62, 95% CI: -0.95, -0.77, P = 0.0002), hepatocyte ballooning (WMD = -0.30, 95% CI: -0.56, -0.04, P = 0.03), lobular inflammation (WMD = -0.39, 95% CI: -0.67, -0.11, P = 0.007) and fibrosis (WMD = -0.39, 95% CI: -0.72, -0.06, P = 0.02). Our analysis also indicated the absence of publication bias between NASH and Vitamin E intake. This meta-analysis indicates that vitamin E supplementation had a significant and positive effect in the improvement of steatosis, ballooning degeneration, lobular inflammation and fibrosis in patients with NASH.","['Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'histological parameters', 'metaanalysis', 'vitamin E']"
Effects of obstructive sleep apnea on retinal microvasculature.,"To detect retinal microvascular variations in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome patients.This prospective, observational case-control study included healthy controls and patients with mild, moderate, and severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Vascular parameters, foveal avascular area, and flow areas in macula-centered, 6.00×6.00 mm<sup>2</sup> scan size optical coherence tomography angiography images were compared.The control group had the highest whole image, parafoveal, and perifoveal vessel density among the groups in both superficial and the deep capillary plexus (all <i>P</i><0.05). Rapid eye movement sleep apnoea-hypopnoea index was reversely correlated with whole (Rho=-0.195, <i>P</i>=0.034), parafoveal (Rho=-0.242, <i>P</i>=0.008), perifoveal (Rho=-0.187, <i>P</i>=0.045) vessel density in the superficial capillary plexus, and whole (Rho=-0.186, <i>P</i>=0.046), parafoveal (Rho=-0.260, <i>P</i>=0.004), perifoveal (Rho=-0.189, <i>P</i>=0.043) vessel density in the deep capillary plexus, though the mean and non-rapid eye movement sleep apnoea-hypopnoea index related with only parafoveal vessel density in the superficial capillary plexus (Rho=-0.213, <i>P</i>=0.020; Rho=-0.191, <i>P</i>=0.038) and the deep capillary plexus (Rho=-0.254, <i>P</i>=0.005; Rho=-0.194, <i>P</i>=0.035).This study shows decreased vessel density and its reverse correlation with the apnoea-hypopnoea index in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.","['apnoeahypopnoea index', 'deep capillary plexus', 'obstructive sleep apnea', 'retinal microvasculature', 'superficial capillary plexus', 'vessel density']"
Choroidal Volume Evaluation after Photodynamic Therapy Using New Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging Algorithm.,"To evaluate choroidal volume and thickness changes after photodynamic therapy (PDT) for chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). Chronic CSC eyes with a history of PDT were selected. Average choroidal volume, average choroidal thickness, the maximum and minimum choroidal thickness of the macula irradiated area and peripheral non-irradiated areas before and after one and three months of treatment were examined. A total of 14 patients with chronic CSC and 9 controls without any eye pathology were enrolled. The mean choroidal volume in CSC before and, and after one and three months of treatment were 2.36 (standard deviation: 0.70), 1.90 (0.69), 1.86 (0.66) mm<sup>3</sup> for the central area, 1.25 (0.38), 1.14 (0.35), 1.13 (0.34) mm<sup>3</sup> for superior nasal area, 1.47 (0.41), 1.28 (0.43), 1.26 (0.43) mm<sup>3</sup> for superior temporal area, 1.07 (0.49), 0.95 (0.38), 0.93 (0.35) mm<sup>3</sup> for inferior nasal area, 1.17 (0.38), 1.04 (0.32), 1.03 (0.33) mm<sup>3</sup> for inferior temporal area. This study revealed the choroidal volume changes in a short period after PDT and a decrease in unirradiated choroidal volume was also shown after the treatment. The algorithm provided on the ARI Network enables to evaluate the choroidal changes quantitatively and qualitatively.","['central serous chorioretinopathy', 'choroidal thickness', 'choroidal volume', 'new algorithm', 'photodynamic therapy']"
Osteopontin versus alpha-fetoprotein as a diagnostic marker for hepatocellular carcinoma: a meta-analysis.,"Several studies have reported that osteopontin (OPN) is a promising marker for the diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, some studies emerged with conflicting results. Therefore, we provide a systematic review to evaluate the diagnostic performance of OPN for HCC.Studies that investigated the diagnostic value of OPN and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in HCC were collected from PubMed and Embase. Sensitivity, specificity, and other parameters about the diagnostic accuracy of serum OPN and AFP in HCC were pooled using STATA 12.0 software. The summary receiver operating characteristic curve (sROC) and other parameters were used to summarize the overall test performance.Twelve studies were included in our meta-analysis. Pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio were 0.813 (95% CI: 0.671-0.902), 0.874 (95% CI: 0.778-0.932), and 30.047 (95% CI: 8.845-102.067) for OPN; 0.639 (95% CI: 0.538-0.729), 0.959 (95% CI: 0.909-0.982), and 41.518 (95% CI: 13.688-125.929) for AFP; and 0.856 (95% CI: 0.760-0.918), 0.738 (95% CI: 0.630-0.823), and 16.718 (95% CI: 7.950-35.156) for OPN+AFP, respectively. The area under the sROC for OPN, AFP, and OPN+AFP was 0.91, 0.88, and 0.85, respectively. For diagnosis of early HCC, pooled sensitivity of serum OPN, AFP, and OPN+AFP was 0.493 (95% CI: 0.422-0.563), 0.517 (95% CI: 0.446-0.587), and 0.732 (95% CI: 0.666-0.791), respectively.OPN is a comparable marker to AFP for the diagnosis of HCC, and the sensitivity of OPN was higher than that of AFP. A combination of AFP and OPN can elevate the sensitivity of diagnosis for early HCC.","['AFP', 'HCC', 'OPN', 'diagnosis', 'metaanalysis']"
Exacerbation of signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis by a controlled adverse environment challenge in subjects with a history of dry eye and ocular allergy.,"The goal of this study was to assess the effect of a controlled adverse environment (CAE) challenge on subjects with both allergic conjunctivitis and dry eye.Thirty-three subjects were screened and 17 completed this institutional review board-approved study. Subjects underwent baseline ocular assessments and conjunctival allergen challenge (CAC) on days 0 and 3. Those who met the ocular redness and itching criteria were randomized to receive either the controlled adverse environment (CAE) challenge (group A, n = 9) or no challenge (group B, n = 8) at day 6. Thirty minutes after CAE/no-CAE, subjects were challenged with allergen and their signs and symptoms graded. Exploratory confocal microscopy was carried out in a subset of subjects at hourly intervals for 5 hours post-CAC on days 3 and 6.Seven minutes post-CAC, subjects exposed to the CAE had significantly greater itching (difference between groups, 0.55 ± 0.25, P = 0.028), conjunctival redness (0.59 ± 0.19, P = 0.002), episcleral redness (0.56 ± 0.19, P = 0.003) and mean overall redness (mean of conjunctival, episcleral, and ciliary redness, 0.59 ± 0.14, P < 0.001). The mean score at 7, 15, and 20 minutes post-CAC for conjunctival redness (0.43 ± 0.17, P = 0.012), episcleral redness (0.49 ± 0.15, P = 0.001), mean overall redness in all regions (0.43 ± 0.15, P = 0.005), and mean chemosis (0.20 ± 0.08, P = 0.017) were also all significantly greater in CAE-treated subjects. Confocal microscopic images of conjunctival vessels after CAC showed more inflammation in CAE-treated subjects.In subjects with both dry eye and allergic conjunctivitis, exposure to adverse environmental conditions causes an ocular surface perturbation that can intensify allergic reactions.","['allergic conjunctivitis', 'comorbidity', 'conjunctival allergen challenge', 'controlled adverse environment', 'dry eye']"
Ultrasound image-based deep learning to assist in diagnosing gross extrathyroidal extension thyroid cancer: a retrospective multicenter study.,"The presence of gross extrathyroidal extension (ETE) in thyroid cancer will affect the prognosis of patients, but imaging examination cannot provide a reliable diagnosis for it. This study was conducted to develop a deep learning (DL) model for localization and evaluation of thyroid cancer nodules in ultrasound images before surgery for the presence of gross ETE.From January 2016 to December 2021 grayscale ultrasound images of 806 thyroid cancer nodules (4451 images) from 4 medical centers were retrospectively analyzed, including 517 no gross ETE nodules and 289 gross ETE nodules. 283 no gross ETE nodules and 158 gross ETE nodules were randomly selected from the internal dataset to form a training set and validation set (2914 images), and a multitask DL model was constructed for diagnosing gross ETE. In addition, the clinical model and the clinical and DL combined model were constructed. In the internal test set [974 images (139 no gross ETE nodules and 83 gross ETE nodules)] and the external test set [563 images (95 no gross ETE nodules and 48 gross ETE nodules)], the diagnostic performance of DL model was verified based on the pathological results. And then, compared the results with the diagnosis by 2 senior and 2 junior radiologists.In the internal test set, DL model demonstrated the highest AUC (0.91; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.96), which was significantly higher than that of two senior radiologists [(AUC, 0.78; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.85; <i>P</i> < 0.001) and (AUC, 0.76; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.83; <i>P</i> < 0.001)] and two juniors radiologists [(AUC, 0.65; 95% CI: 0.58, 0.73; <i>P</i> < 0.001) and (AUC, 0.69; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.77; <i>P</i> < 0.001)]. DL model was significantly higher than clinical model [(AUC, 0.84; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.89; <i>P</i> = 0.019)], but there was no significant difference between DL model and clinical and DL combined model [(AUC, 0.94; 95% CI: 0.91, 0.97; <i>P</i> = 0.143)]. In the external test set, DL model also demonstrated the highest AUC (0.88, 95% CI: 0.81, 0.94), which was significantly higher than that of one of senior radiologists [(AUC, 0.75; 95% CI: 0.66, 0.84; <i>P</i> = 0.008) and (AUC, 0.81; 95% CI: 0.72, 0.89; <i>P</i> = 0.152)] and two junior radiologists [(AUC, 0.72; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.81; <i>P</i> = 0.002) and (AUC, 0.67; 95 CI: 0.57, 0.77; <i>P</i> < 0.001]. There was no significant difference between DL model and clinical model [(AUC, 0.85; 95% CI: 0.79, 0.91; <i>P</i> = 0.516)] and clinical + DL model [(AUC, 0.92; 95% CI: 0.87, 0.96; <i>P</i> = 0.093)]. Using DL model, the diagnostic ability of two junior radiologists was significantly improved.The DL model based on ultrasound imaging is a simple and helpful tool for preoperative diagnosis of gross ETE thyroid cancer, and its diagnostic performance is equivalent to or even better than that of senior radiologists.Jiangxi Provincial Natural Science Foundation (20224BAB216079), the Key Research and Development Program of Jiangxi Province (20181BBG70031), and the Interdisciplinary Innovation Fund of Natural Science, Nanchang University (9167-28220007-YB2110).","['Deep learning', 'Gross extrathyroidal extension thyroid cancer', 'Ultrasound']"
Reducing radiation dose for NN-based COVID-19 detection in helical chest CT using real-time monitored reconstruction.,"Computed tomography is a powerful tool for medical examination, which plays a particularly important role in the investigation of acute diseases, such as COVID-19. A growing concern in relation to CT scans is the radiation to which the patients are exposed, and a lot of research is dedicated to methods and approaches to how to reduce the radiation dose in X-ray CT studies. In this paper, we propose a novel scanning protocol based on real-time monitored reconstruction for a helical chest CT using a pre-trained neural network model for COVID-19 detection as an expert. In a simulated study, for the first time, we proposed using per-slice stopping rules based on the COVID-19 detection neural network output to reduce the frequency of projection acquisition for portions of the scanning process. The proposed method allows reducing the total number of X-ray projections necessary for COVID-19 detection, and thus reducing the radiation dose, without a significant decrease in the prediction accuracy. The proposed protocol was evaluated on 163 patients from the COVID-CTset dataset, providing a mean dose reduction of 15.1% while the mean decrease in prediction accuracy amounted to only 1.9% achieving a Pareto improvement over a fixed protocol.","['Automated control', 'COVID19', 'Dose reduction', 'Helical chest CT', 'Monitored reconstruction', 'Neural network']"
The relationship between sublingual immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis and the risk of symptoms in patients with COVID-19 infection.,"To evaluated the risk ratio of Allergic rhinitis (AR) people on the symptoms after COVID-19 infection, and explored the relationship between AR and the symptoms after COVID-19 infection. An observational study was performed of people from outpatient department of the Hospital of Chengdu University of Chinese Medicine. Participants completed an electronic survey and between January 10 to January 20, 2023. We divided the participants into three groups according to the disease information of the population: non-AR people group (AR-N), AR patients with sublingual immunotherapy group (AR-S), and AR patients with conventional therapy group (AR-C). A total of 1116 participants were included in the study, with an average age of 21.76 ± 8.713, women accounted for 62.5%, men accounted for 37.5%. The final results showed that the risk of most symptoms after AR-C infection was not different from that of AR-N, except for sore throat, dry and itchy, chest distress, shortness of breath, and dyspnea. AR-S could effectively reduce the risk of post-infection symptoms including: dry and itchy (OR = 0.484, 95%CI: 0.335-0.698), pain (OR = 0.513, 95%CI:0.362-0.728), cough (OR = 0.506, 95% CI:0.341-0.749), expectoration (OR = 0.349, 95% CI:0.244-0.498), fever (OR = 0.569, 95% CI:0.379-0.853), head and body pain (OR = 0.456, 95% CI:0.323-0.644), fatigue (OR = 0.256, 95% CI:0.177-0.371), cold limbs (OR = 0.325, 95%CI:0.227-0.465), diarrhea (OR = 0.246, 95% CI:0.132-0.457), constipation (OR = 0.227, 95%CI:0.100-0.513), hyposmia (OR = 0.456, 95% CI:0.296-0.701), hypogeusia (OR = 0.397, 95% CI:0.259-0.607), chest distress (OR = 0.534, 95% CI:0.343-0.829), shortness of breath (OR = 0.622, 95% CI:0.398-0.974), palpitations (OR = 0.355, 95% CI:0.206-0.613). The risk of symptoms after COVID-19 infection in allergic rhinitis population receiving sublingual immunotherapy is lower.","['COVID19', 'allergic rhinitis', 'odds ratio', 'sublingual immunotherapy', 'the symptoms after COVID19 infection']"
How sleep duration mediated childhood trauma and Internet addiction of the vocational college population in urban areas of south China.,"Internet Addiction is positively associated with a range of psychological risk factors such as childhood trauma and sleep disorders. However, it remains unclear if sleep duration mediates the association between childhood trauma and Internet addiction.We enrolled 14,263 students from Shenzhen Polytechnic College, China. Sleep duration, Internet addiction and childhood maltreatment were assessed in these students by self-report measures, Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), respectively. With bootstrap approach and path analysis, the mediating role of sleep duration in the association between childhood trauma and Internet addiction was analysed.The Internet-addicted group exhibited a higher level of the emotional abuse (EA) score, physical abuse (PA) score, sexual abuse (SA) score, a lower level of emotional neglect (EN) score and sleep duration compared with the control group (all <i>p</i> < 0.001). The CTQ total score and subscores showed a positive correlation with IAT scores both for males (<i>r</i> = 0.199, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for the total score, <i>r</i> = 0.356, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for EA, <i>r</i> = 0.270, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for PA, <i>r</i> = 0.249, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for SA, and <i>r</i> = 0.132, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for PN) and females (<i>r</i> = 0.127, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for the total score, <i>r</i> = 0.335, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for EA, <i>r</i> = 0.187, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for PA, <i>r</i> = 0.189, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for SA, and <i>r</i> = 0.065, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for PN). The CTQ subcores were negatively related to sleep duration both for males (<i>r</i> = -0.177, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for EA, <i>r</i> = -0.180, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for PA and <i>r</i> = 0.182, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for SA) and females (<i>r</i> = -0.137, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for EA, <i>r</i> = -0.105, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for PA, and <i>r</i> = -0.182, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for SA) and sleep duration was negatively correlated with IAT scores both in males (<i>r</i> = -0.120, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and females (<i>r</i> = -0.108, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Further, the path analysis suggested that EA and SA mediated significantly to the Internet addiction when all types of childhood trauma were examined in one model (both <i>p</i> < 0.001).In the current study, a great proportion of students met criteria for Internet addiction. Sleep duration mediated a significant proportion of the indirect effect between EA/SA and Internet addiction. The findings may help with prevention and intervention of Internet addiction in the future. The limitation of this study was that it was a cross-sectional study and not controlling for other mental disorders. Future large-scale longitudinal studies will be needed to further clarify the relationship between childhood abuse and Internet addiction and the mediation role of sleep duration.","['Internet addiction', 'childhood trauma', 'sleep duration', 'south China', 'young adults']"
Wrist pulse signal based vascular age calculation using mixed Gaussian model and support vector regression.,"Vascular age (VA) is the direct index to reflect vascular aging, so it plays a particular role in public health. How to obtain VA conveniently and cheaply has always been a research hotspot. This study proposes a new method to evaluate VA with wrist pulse signal.Firstly, we fit the pulse signal by mixed Gaussian model (MGM) to extract the shape features, and adopt principal component analysis (PCA) to optimize the dimension of the shape features. Secondly, the principal components and chronological age (CA) are respectively taken as the independent variables and dependent variable to establish support vector regression (SVR) model. Thirdly, the principal components are fed into the SVR model to predicted the vascular aging of each subject. The predicted value is regarded as the description of VA. Finally, we compare the correlation coefficients of VA with pulse width (PW), inflection point area ratio (IPA), Ratio b/a (RBA), augmentation index (AIx), diastolic augmentation index (DAI) and pulse transit time (PTT) with those of CA with these six indices.Compared with the CA, the VA is closer to PW (<i>r</i> = 0.539, <i>P</i> < 0.001 to <i>r</i> = 0.589, <i>P</i> < 0.001 in men; <i>r</i> = 0.325, <i>P</i> < 0.001 to <i>r</i> = 0.400, <i>P</i> < 0.001 in women), IPA (<i>r</i> =  - 0.446, <i>P</i> < 0.001 to <i>r</i> =  - 0.534, <i>P</i> < 0.001 in men; <i>r</i> =  - 0.623, <i>P</i> < 0.001 to <i>r</i> =  - 0.660, <i>P</i> < 0.001 in women), RBA (<i>r</i> = 0.328, <i>P</i> < 0.001 to <i>r</i> = 0.371, <i>P</i> < 0.001 in women), AIx (<i>r</i> = 0.659, <i>P</i> < 0.001 to <i>r</i> = 0.738, <i>P</i> < 0.001 in men; <i>r</i> = 0.547, <i>P</i> < 0.001 to <i>r</i> = 0.573, <i>P</i> < 0.001 in women), DAI (<i>r</i> = 0.517, <i>P</i> < 0.001 to <i>r</i> = 0.532, <i>P</i> < 0.001 in men; <i>r</i> = 0.507, <i>P</i> < 0.001 to <i>r</i> = 0.570, <i>P</i> < 0.001 in women) and PTT (<i>r</i> = 0.526, <i>P</i> < 0.001 to <i>r</i> = 0.659, <i>P</i> < 0.001 in men; <i>r</i> = 0.577, <i>P</i> < 0.001 to <i>r</i> = 0.814, <i>P</i> < 0.001 in women).The VA is more representative of vascular aging than CA. The method presented in this study provides a new way to directly and objectively assess vascular aging in public health.","['Chronological age', 'Mixed Gaussian model', 'Support vector regression', 'Vascular age', 'Wrist pulse signal']"
Exhaled carbon monoxide levels in infants and toddlers with episodic asthma.,"There are few lung function tests available to evaluate bronchial asthma in infants and toddlers. The objective of this study was to test the hypothesis that the measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide (eCO) levels is applicable to evaluate infants and toddlers with stable asthma and during acute asthma attack.A one-way valve breath sampling bag was developed to collect the exhaled air of infants and toddlers. A total of 483 infants (under 2 years) and toddlers (2-5 years) were studied; 355 had an established diagnosis of asthma (182 suffering mild asthma attacks and 173 without active asthmatic symptoms), 119 had upper respiratory infection (URI) including acute bronchitis, and 9 were healthy.In infants and toddlers, eCO levels of those with asthma attacks [median (interquartile range) = 2.0 (2.0-3.25) ppm, n=182] were significantly higher than those of subjects with asymptomatic asthma [2.0 (1.0-2.0) ppm, n=173, P < 0.0001], URI [2.0 (1.0-3.0) ppm, n=119, P < 0.0001], and healthy children [1.0 (0.0-1.0) ppm, n=9, P < 0.0001]. In 75 children with asthma petit mal, eCO levels during asthma attacks [3.0 (2.0-4.0) ppm] significantly decreased after therapy [1.0 (1.0-2.0) ppm, P < 0.0001]. In infants and toddlers with an established diagnosis of asthma (n=355), eCO cut-off >2 ppm discriminated asthma attack from an asymptomatic state with a sensitivity of 95.6%, a specificity of 43.3%, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71 (95% CI:0.65-0.76, P < 0.0001). In 401 infants and toddlers with some respiratory symptoms, of which 285 cases were finally diagnosed as asthma [eCO level = 2.0 (2.0-3.0) ppm] and 116 cases were not asthma [eCO level = 2.0 (1.0-3.0) ppm, P < 0.0001], eCO cut-off >3 ppm supported the final diagnosis of asthma with a sensitivity of 38.9%, a specificity of 74.1%, and AUC of 0.63 (95% CI:0.56-0.69, P < 0.0001).The measurement of eCO by a novel method is applicable to evaluate asthmatic activity and treatment responsiveness, and to diagnose asthma in infants and toddlers.","['infants and toddlers', 'mild asthma attack', 'simple breath sampling method']"
Personality Traits Predict Self-Rated Health (SRH) in Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Patients and Healthy Controls.,"The objective of the present study is to examine the association between Big Five personality traits and self-rated health (SRH) among individuals with coronary heart disease (CHD), and to compare this relationship with that of healthy control participants, which is of importance as SRH can be a determinant of outcomes.The current study used data from 566 participants with CHD with a mean age of 63.00 (S.D. = 15.23) years old (61.13% males) and 8608 age- and sex-matched healthy controls with a mean age of 63.87 (S.D.= 9.60) years old (61.93% males) from the UKHLS. The current study used predictive normative modelling approaches, one-sample <i>t</i> tests, a hierarchical regression, and two multiple regressions.The current study found that CHD patients have significantly lower Conscientiousness (t(565) = -3.84, <i>p</i> < 0.001, 95% C.I. [-0.28, -0.09], Cohen's d = -0.16) and SRH (t(565) = -13.83, <i>p</i> < 0.001, 95% C.I. [-0.68, -0.51], and Cohen's d = -0.58) scores compared to age and sex-matched healthy controls. Moreover, health status (controls vs. CHD patients) moderated the links between Neuroticism, Extraversion and SRH. Specifically, Neuroticism (b = -0.03, <i>p</i> < 0.01, 95% C.I. [-0.04, -0.01]), Openness (b = 0.04, <i>p</i> < 0.001, 95% C.I. [0.02, 0.06]), and Conscientiousness (b = 0.08, <i>p</i> < 0.001, 95% C.I. [0.06, 0.10]) were significant predictors of SRH in healthy controls, whereas Conscientiousness (b = 0.08, <i>p</i> < 0.05, 95% C.I. [0.01, 0.16]) and Extraversion (b = -0.09, <i>p</i> < 0.01, 95% C.I. [-0.15, -0.02]) were significant predictors of SRH in CHD patients.Based on the close associations between personality traits and SRH, and the subsequent impact on patient outcomes, the results of this study should be taken into consideration by clinicians and health professionals when developing tailored treatment and intervention programs for their patients.","['Big Five', 'coronary heart disease', 'personality', 'selfrated health']"
"Enhancing Palliative Care for Patients With Advanced Heart Failure Through Simple Prognostication Tools: A Comparison of the Surprise Question, the Number of Previous Heart Failure Hospitalizations, and the Seattle Heart Failure Model for Predicting 1-Year Survival.","Score-based survival prediction in patients with advanced heart failure (HF) is complicated. Easy-to-use prognostication tools could inform clinical decision-making and palliative care delivery.To compare the prognostic utility of the Seattle HF model (SHFM), the surprise question (SQ), and the number of HF hospitalizations (NoH) within the last 12 months for predicting 1-year survival in patients with advanced HF.We retrospectively analyzed data from a cluster-randomized controlled trial of advanced HF patients, predominantly with reduced ejection fraction. Primary outcome was the prognostic discrimination of SHFM, SQ (""Would you be surprised if this patient were to die within 1 year?"") answered by HF cardiologists, and NoH, assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Optimal cut-offs were calculated using Youden's index (SHFM: <86% predicted 1-year survival; NoH ≥ 2).Of 535 subjects, 82 (15.3%) had died after 1-year of follow-up. SHFM, SQ, and NoH yielded a similar area under the ROC curve [SHFM: 0.65 (0.60-0.71 95% CI); SQ: 0.58 (0.54-0.63 95% CI); NoH: 0.56 (0.50-0.62 95% CI)] and similar sensitivity [SHFM: 0.76 (0.65-0.84 95% CI); SQ: 0.84 (0.74-0.91 95% CI); NoH: 0.56 (0.45-0.67 95% CI)]. As compared to SHFM, SQ had lower specificity [SQ: 0.33 (0.28-0.37 95% CI) vs. SHFM: 0.55 (0.50-0.60 95% CI)] while NoH had similar specificity [0.56 (0.51-0.61 95% CI)]. SQ combined with NoH showed significantly higher specificity [0.68 (0.64-0.73 95% CI)].SQ and NoH yielded comparable utility to SHFM for 1-year survival prediction among advanced HF patients, are easy-to-use and could inform bedside decision-making.","['Seattle Heart Failure Model', 'advanced heart failure', 'number of hospitalizations', 'palliative care', 'surprise question', 'survival prediction']"
Predictive values of static endoscopic evaluation of swallowing in adults.,"Static endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (SEES) is an instrumental evaluation developed for in-office identification of patients who may benefit from a modified barium swallow study (MBSS). We aim to determine the predictive value of SEES for evaluating dysphagia.A retrospective case series was performed on adults evaluated for dysphagia using SEES followed by MBSS at a single tertiary care center. Studies were evaluated by two blinded expert raters.Fifty-eight patients were included. Thin liquid penetration on SEES had a sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.86 (95% CI 0.70-0.95), 0.63 (95% CI 0.24-0.91), 0.91 (95% CI 0.76-0.98), and 0.5 (0.19-0.81), respectively, for predicting thin liquid penetration on MBSS, and 1.0 (95% CI 0.59-1.0), 0.29 (95% CI 0.15-0.47), 0.23 (95% CI 0.10-0.41), and 1.0 (95% CI 0.69-1.0) for predicting thin liquid aspiration on MBSS. Thin liquid aspiration on SEES had a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 0.67 (95% CI 0.09-0.99), 0.85 (95% CI 0.66-0.96), 0.33 (95% CI 0.04-0.78), and 0.96 (95% CI 0.79-1.0), respectively, for predicting thin liquid aspiration on MBSS.SEES may be used as an objective in-office test to screen for aspiration and penetration. Thin liquid penetration on SEES is moderately sensitive for predicting penetration on MBSS. Absence of thin liquid penetration or aspiration on SEES has a high NPV for excluding aspiration on MBSS. Abnormalities on SEES or the need to view the entire swallowing mechanism should prompt an MBSS for a more complete evaluation of dysphagia.Level of Evidence: 4.","['aspiration', 'dysphagia', 'instrumental evaluation of swallow', 'screening']"
Effect of Obesity on Retinal Integrity in African Americans and Caucasian Americans With Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis.,"<b>Objective:</b> To study the effect of obesity on retinal structures in African Americans (AAs) and Caucasian Americans (CAs) with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). <b>Methodology:</b> About 136 patients with RRMS without history of optic neuritis were divided into two groups, based on body mass index (BMI): 67 obese (40 AA, 27 CA, mean BMI ± SD: 36.7 ± 5.8), and 69 non-obese (23 AA, 46 CA, mean BMI ± SD: 24.0 ± 3.1). The peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL) thickness was quantified by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and was segmented into quadrant thickness: superior (S), inferior (I), temporal (T), and nasal (N). Papillomacular bundle (PMB) thickness, retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), ganglion cell + inner plexiform layer (GCIPL), inner nuclear (INL), outer plexiform (OPL), outer nuclear (ONL), and total macular (TMV) volumes were obtained. <b>Results:</b> Obesity was associated with lower T thickness (58.54 ± 15.2 vs. 61.9 12.4, <i>p</i> = 0.044), higher INL (0.98 ± 0.07 vs. 0.96 ± 0.06, <i>p</i> = 0.034), and lower RNFL (0.77 ± 0.14 vs. 0.82 ± 0.12, <i>p</i> = 0.009) volumes. Obese AA had significantly thinner T (58.54 ± 15.19 vs. 61.91 ± 12.39, <i>p</i> = 0.033), N (68.94 ± 2.7 vs. 77.94 ± 3.3, <i>p</i> = 0.044), and TMV (8.15 ± 0.07 vs. 8.52 ± 0.09, <i>p</i> = 0.003), RNFL (0.74 ± 0.02 vs. 0.82 ± 0.02, <i>p</i> = 0.013), OPL (0.76 ± 0.01 vs. 0.79 ± 0.1, <i>p</i> = 0.050), ONL (1.68 ± 0.031 vs. 1.79 ± 0.038, <i>p</i> = 0.026), and GCIPL (1.78 ± 0.04 vs. 1.9 ± 0.05, <i>p</i> = 0.038) compared to obese CA. Among patients with non-obesity, the ONL was significantly lower in AA (1.78 ± 0.04 vs. 1.9 ± 0.05, <i>p</i> < 0.001). <b>Conclusions:</b> Obesity is associated with retinal structure abnormalities in patients with RRMS. Its impact might be more prominent in AA than CA. Large longitudinal studies are needed to validate our findings.","['body mass index', 'multiple sclerosis', 'obesity', 'optical coherence tomography', 'retinal integrity']"
Birth weight is associated with dietary factors at the age of 6-8 years: the Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children (PANIC) study.,"Low and high birth weight have been associated with increased risk of type 2 diabetes and CVD. Diet could partly mediate this association, e.g. by intra-uterine programming of unhealthy food preferences. We examined the association of birth weight with diet in Finnish children.Birth weight standard deviation score (SDS) was calculated using national birth register data and Finnish references. Dietary factors were assessed using 4 d food records. Diet quality was defined by the Finnish Children Healthy Eating Index (FCHEI).The Physical Activity and Nutrition in Children (PANIC) study.Singleton, full-term children (179 girls, 188 boys) aged 6-8 years.Birth weight was inversely associated (standardized regression coefficient β; 95 % CI) with FCHEI (-0·15; -0·28, -0·03) in all children and in boys (-0·27; -0·45, -0·09) but not in girls (-0·01; -0·21, 0·18) after adjusting for potential confounders (P=0·044 for interaction). Moreover, higher birth weight was associated with lower fruit and berries consumption (-0·13; -0·25, 0·00), higher energy intake (0·17; 0·05, 0·29), higher sucrose intake (0·19; 0·06, 0·32) and lower fibre intake (-0·14; -0·26, -0·01). These associations were statistically non-significant after correction for multiple testing. Children with birth weight >1 SDS had higher sucrose intake (mean; 95 % CI) as a percentage of energy intake (14·3 E%; 12·6, 16·0 E%) than children with birth weight of -1 to 1 SDS (12·8 E%; 11·6, 14·0 E%) or <-1 SDS (12·4 E%; 10·8, 13·9 E%; P=0·036).Higher birth weight may be associated with unhealthy diet in childhood.","['Birth weight', 'Children', 'Diet', 'Diet quality', 'PANIC study']"
Validation of the 6-Item Cognitive Impairment Test and the 4AT test for combined delirium and dementia screening in older Emergency Department attendees.,"screening for cognitive impairment in Emergency Department (ED) requires short, reliable tools.to validate the 4AT and 6-Item Cognitive Impairment Test (6-CIT) for ED dementia and delirium screening.diagnostic accuracy study.attendees aged ≥70 years in a tertiary care hospital's ED.trained researchers assessed participants using the Standardised Mini Mental State Examination, Delirium Rating Scale-Revised 98 and Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly, informing ultimate expert diagnosis using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) criteria for dementia and delirium (reference standards). Another researcher blindly screened each participant, within 3 h, using index tests 4AT and 6-CIT.of 419 participants (median age 77 years), 15.2% had delirium and 21.5% had dementia. For delirium detection, 4AT had positive predictive value (PPV) 0.68 (95% confidence intervals: 0.58-0.79) and negative predictive value (NPV) 0.99 (0.97-1.00). At a pre-specified 9/10 cut-off (9 is normal), 6-CIT had PPV 0.35 (0.27-0.44) and NPV 0.98 (0.95-0.99). Importantly, 52% of participants had no family present. A novel algorithm for scoring 4AT item 4 where collateral history is unavailable (score 4 if items 2-3 score ≥1; score 0 if items 1-3 score is 0) proved reliable; PPV 0.65 (0.54-0.76) and NPV 0.99 (0.97-1.00). For dementia detection, 4AT had PPV 0.39 (0.32-0.46) and NPV 0.94 (0.89-0.96); 6-CIT had PPV 0.46 (0.37-0.55) and NPV 0.94 (0.90-0.97).6-CIT and 4AT accurately exclude delirium and dementia in older ED attendees. 6-CIT does not require collateral history but has lower PPV for delirium.","['delirium', 'dementia', 'emergency department', 'older people', 'screening']"
Sex differences in cardiac rehabilitation barriers among non-enrollees in the context of lower gender equality: a cross-sectional study.,"Despite the benefits of cardiac rehabilitation (CR), it remains under-utilized, particularly by women. This study compared CR barriers between non-enrolling men and women in Iran, which has among the lowest gender equality globally.In this cross-sectional study, CR barriers were assessed via phone interview in phase II non-attenders from March 2017 to February 2018 with the Persian version of the Cardiac Rehabilitation Barriers Scale (CRBS-P). T-tests were used to compare scores, with each of 18 barriers scored out of 5, between men and women.357 (33.9%) of the sample of 1053 were women, and they were older, less educated and less often employed than men. Total mean CRBS scores were significantly greater in women (2.37 ± 0.37) than men (2.29 ± 0.35; effect size[ES] = 0.08, confidence interval[CI]: 0.03-0.13; p < 0.001). The top CR barriers among women were cost (3.35; ES = 0.40, CI:0.23-0.56; P < 0.001), transportation problems (3.24; ES = 0.41, CI:0.25-0.58; P < 0.001), distance (3.21; ES = 0.31, CI:0.15-0.48; P < 0.001), comorbidities (2.97; ES = 0.49, CI:0.34-0.64; P < 0.001), low energy (2.41; ES = 0.29, CI:0.18-0.41; P < 0.001), finding exercise as tiring or painful (2.22; ES = 0.11, CI:0.02-0.21; P = 0.018), and older age (2.27; ES = 0.18, CI:0.07-0.28; P = 0.001). Men rated ""already exercise at home or in community"" (2.69; ES = 0.23, CI:0.1-0.36; P = 0.001), time constraints (2.18; ES = 0.15, CI:0.07-0.23; P < 0.001) and work responsibilities (2.24; ES = 0.16, CI:0.07-0.25; P = 0.001) as greater CR barriers than women.Women had greater barriers to CR participation than men. CR programs should be modified to address women's needs. Home-based CR tailored to women's exercise needs and preferences should be considered.","['Access to care', 'Cardiac rehabilitation', 'Ischemic heart disease', 'Sex differences']"
"""Healthy immigrant effect"" among individuals experiencing homelessness in Spain?: Foreign-born individuals had higher average age at death in 15-year retrospective cohort study.","Individuals experiencing homelessness (IEHs) suffer from severe health inequities. Place of origin is linked to health and mortality of IEHs. In the general population the ""healthy immigrant effect"" provides a health advantage to foreign-born people. This phenomenon has not been sufficiently studied among the IEH population. The objectives are to study morbidity, mortality, and age at death among IEHs in Spain, paying special attention to their origin (Spanish-born or foreign-born) and to examine correlates and predictors of age at death.Retrospective cohort study (observational study) of a 15-year period (2006-2020). We included 391 IEHs who had been attended at one of the city's public mental health, substance use disorder, primary health, or specialized social services. Subsequently, we noted which subjects died during the study period and analyzed the variables related to their age at death. We compared the results based on origin (Spanish-born vs. foreign-born) and fitted a multiple linear regression model to the data to establish predictors of an earlier age at death.The mean age at death was 52.38 years. Spanish-born IEHs died on average almost nine years younger. The leading causes of death overall were suicide and drug-related disorders (cirrhosis, overdose, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD]). The results of the linear regression showed that earlier death was linked to COPD (b = - 0.348), being Spanish-born (b = 0.324), substance use disorder [cocaine (b =-0.169), opiates (b =.-243), and alcohol (b =-0.199)], cardiovascular diseases (b = - 0.223), tuberculosis (b = - 0.163), high blood pressure (b =-0.203), criminal record (b =-0.167), and hepatitis C (b =-0.129). When we separated the causes of death for Spanish-born and foreign-born subjects, we found that the main predictors of death among Spanish-born IEHs were opiate use disorder (b =-0.675), COPD (b =-0.479), cocaine use disorder (b =-0.208), high blood pressure (b =-0.358), multiple drug use disorder (b =-0.365), cardiovascular disease (b =-0.306), dual pathology (b =-0.286), female gender (b =-0.181), personality disorder (b =-0.201), obesity (b =-0.123), tuberculosis (b =-0.120) and having a criminal record (b =-0.153). In contrast, the predictors of death among foreign-born IEHs were psychotic disorder (b =-0.134), tuberculosis (b =-0.132), and opiate (b =-0.119) or alcohol use disorder (b =-0.098).IEHs die younger than the general population, often due to suicide and drug use. The healthy immigrant effect seems to hold in IEHs as well as in the general population.","['COPD', 'Health', 'Homelessness', 'Immigrant advantage', 'Immigration', 'Mortality', 'Substance use', 'Substance use disorder']"

Sleep health and its related influencing factors in primary and middle school students in Fuzhou: A large multi-center cross-sectional study.,"This current study set out to investigate the status of sleep health in 7-20-year-old students in Fuzhou and explore the related influencing factors of sleep health.A total of 38,467 children and adolescents in Fuzhou were included in the study through a random stratified cluster sampling. Data were collected from May to June 2019, in 18 primary schools and 18 middle schools from nine districts, Fuzhou. Children's parents and adolescents of sampled classes were invited to fill out a series of questionnaires about the performance of the last 6 months (sociodemographic characteristics, sleep-related lifestyle behaviors, and electronic-products usage). Multiple linear regression was carried out to analyze data.Of the total 40,888 questionnaires we released, 38,467 were valid and effective with the response rate was 94.08%. The age of the surveyed participants was 11.85 ± 3.1, including 20,013 boys and 18,454 girls. The multiple linear regression analysis identified factors associated with sleep health (<i>p</i> < 0.05): Boy (coef = 0.073, 95% CI: 0.030-0.115), age (coef = 1.797, 95% CI: 0.224-0.243), key school (coef = 2.069, 95% CI: 0.105-0.193), urban (coef = 0.096, 95% CI: 0.054-0.139), excessive daytime sleepiness (coef = 0.535, 95% CI: 0.432-0.639), unhealthy sleep habits (coef = 0.363, 95% CI: 0.307-0.419), eating before sleep (coef = 0.578, 95% CI: 0.527-0.630), using electronic products in bedroom (coef = 0.074, 95% CI: 0.028-0.121), screen time per day during school (coef = 0.260, 95% CI: 0.235-0.284), frequency of using electronics 30 min before bedtime (coef = 0.150, 95% CI: 0.134-0.166), strained relationship with parents (coef = 0.361, 95% CI: 0.270-0.452), strained relationship with peers (coef = 0.267, 95% CI: 0.171-0.363), excessive homework or learning (coef = 0.189, 95% CI: 0.141-0.237), time for doing homework (coef = 0.266, 95% CI: 0.245-0.287), and mood swings frequently (coef = 1.174, 95% CI: 1.127-1.221) negatively impact sleep health. Sleep alone (coef = -0.204, 95% CI: -0.262-0.147) were the risk factors for sleep health. Furthermore, frequent mood swings was considered the most influential factor on overall variables.Sleep health is associated with factors covered sociodemographic characteristics, family sleep habits, and routine activities before bedtime. Multiple measures should be taken to improve sleep quality in a targeted manner.","['Fuzhou', 'children and adolescents', 'factors', 'sleep habits', 'sleep health']"
Hypoadiponectemia is associated with metabolic syndrome in patients with type 2 diabetes.,"Adipose tissue-expressed adiponectin levels are inversely related to the degree of adiposity, and a reduction in adiponectin serum levels is accompanied by insulin resistance. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between serum adiponectin concentration and metabolic syndrome (MetS) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). Fasting blood samples were obtained from 150 volunteers with type 2 DM. MetS and its components were defined according to diagnostic criteria from the International Diabetes Federation. Serum adiponectin concentrations were measured using a commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Among the 150 patients with type 2 DM, 102 (68.0%) had MetS. Female gender (<i>P</i> = 0.007), hypertension (<i>P</i> = 0.005), systolic blood pressure (<i>P</i> < 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (DBP, <i>P</i> < 0.001), waist circumference (<i>P</i> < 0.001), body weight (<i>P</i> < 0.001), body mass index (BMI, <i>P</i> < 0.001), fasting glucose (<i>P</i> = 0.035), triglyceride (TG) level (<i>P</i> < 0.001), glycated hemoglobin level (HbA1c, <i>P</i> = 0.020), insulin level (<i>P</i> < 0.001), and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR, <i>P</i> < 0.001) were higher in DM patients who had MetS, whereas high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) concentrations (<i>P</i> < 0.001) and adiponectin levels (<i>P</i> < 0.001) were lower. Univariate linear analysis revealed that logarithmically transformed age (log-age, <i>r</i> = 0.279; <i>P</i> = 0.001) and HDL-C (<i>r</i> = 0.246; <i>P</i> = 0.002) positively correlated, whereas height (<i>r</i> = -0.183; <i>P</i> = 0.025), body weight (<i>r</i> = -0.282; <i>P</i> < 0.001), BMI (<i>r</i> = -0.237; <i>P</i> = 0.004), waist circumference (<i>r</i> = -0.249; <i>P</i> = 0.002), DBP (<i>r</i> = 0.252; <i>P</i> = 0.002), log-TG (<i>r</i> = 0.255; <i>P</i> = 0.002), log-insulin (<i>r</i> = -0.298; <i>P</i> < 0.001), and log-HOMA-IR (<i>r</i> = 0.288; <i>P</i> < 0.001) negatively correlated with serum adiponectin levels in patients with type 2 DM. Multivariate forward stepwise linear regression analysis revealed that log-age (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> change = 0.069; <i>P</i> < 0.001) positively correlated, whereas log-insulin (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> change = 0.182; <i>P</i> = 0.002) and HDL-C (adjusted R<sup>2</sup> change = 0.037; <i>P</i> = 0.006) negatively correlated with serum adiponectin levels in patients with type 2 DM. This study showed that lower serum adiponectin levels were positively associated with MetS in patients with type 2 DM and significantly positively related to age but negatively related to serum insulin and HDL-C levels in these subjects.","['Metabolic syndrome', 'adiponectin', 'diabetes mellitus']"
Accumulated mannitol and aggravated cerebral edema in a rat model of middle cerebral artery infarction.,"Repeated administration of mannitol in the setting of large hemispheric infarction is a controversial and poorly defined therapeutic intervention. This study was performed to examine the effects of multiple-dose mannitol on a brain edema after large hemispheric infarction.A middle cerebral artery was occluded with the rat suture model for 6 hours and reperfused in 22 rats. The rats were randomly assigned to either control (n=10) or the mannitol-treated group (n=12) in which intravenous mannitol infusions (0.8 g/kg) were performed six times every four hours. After staining a brain slice with 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride, the weight of hemispheres, infarcted (IH) and contralateral (CH), and the IH/CH weight ratio were examined, and then hemispheric accumulation of mannitol was photometrically evaluated based on formation of NADH catalyzed by mannitol dehydrogenase.Mannitol administration produced changes in body weight of -7.6+/-1.1%, increased plasma osmolality to 312+/-8 mOsm/L. It remarkably increased weight of IH (0.77+/-0.06 gm versus 0.68+/-0.03 gm : p<0.01) and the IH/CH weight ratio (1.23+/-0.07 versus 1.12+/-0.05 : p<0.01). The photometric absorption at 340 nm of the cerebral tissue in the mannitol-treated group was increased to 0.375+/-0.071 and 0.239+/-0.051 in the IH and CH, respectively from 0.167+/-0.082 and 0.162+/-0.091 in the IH and CH of the control group (p<0.01).Multiple-dose mannitol is likely to aggravate cerebral edema due to parenchymal accumulation of mannitol in the infarcted brain tissue.","['Brain edema', 'Cerebral infarction', 'Mannitol', 'Mannitol dehydrogenase', 'Middle cerebral artery', 'Rat']"
Saturated fatty acids differently affect mitochondrial function and the intestinal epithelial barrier depending on their chain length in the <i>in vitro</i> model of IPEC-J2 enterocytes.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Maintenance of the intestinal barrier mainly relies on the mitochondrial function of intestinal epithelial cells that provide ATP through oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Dietary fatty acid overload might induce mitochondrial dysfunction of enterocytes and may increase intestinal permeability as indicated by previous <i>in vitro</i> studies with palmitic acid (C16:0). Yet the impact of other dietary saturated fatty acids remains poorly described. <b>Methods:</b> To address this question, the <i>in vitro</i> model of porcine enterocytes IPEC-J2 was treated for 3 days with 250 µM of lauric (C12:0), myristic (C14:0), palmitic (C16:0) or stearic (C18:0) acids. <b>Results and discussion:</b> Measurement of the transepithelial electrical resistance, reflecting tight junction integrity, revealed that only C16:0 and C18:0 increased epithelial permeability, without modifying the expression of genes encoding tight junction proteins. Bioenergetic measurements indicated that C16:0 and C18:0 were barely β-oxidized by IPEC-J2. However, they rather induced significant OXPHOS uncoupling and reduced ATP production compared to C12:0 and C14:0. These bioenergetic alterations were associated with elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production and mitochondrial fission. Although C12:0 and C14:0 treatment induced significant lipid storage and enhanced fusion of the mitochondrial network, it only mildly decreased ATP production without altering epithelial barrier. These results point out that the longer chain fatty acids C16:0 and C18:0 increased intestinal permeability, contrary to C12:0 and C14:0. In addition, C16:0 and C18:0 induced an important energy deprivation, notably via increased proton leaks, mitochondrial remodeling, and elevated ROS production in enterocytes compared to C12:0 and C14:0.","['barrier function', 'enterocyte', 'fatty acids', 'intestine', 'metabolism', 'mitochondria']"
Lower incisor inclination regarding different reference planes.,"The purpose of this study was to assess the degree of lower incisor inclination with respect to different reference planes. It was an observational, analytical, longitudinal, prospective study conducted on 100 lateral cephalograms which were corrected according to the photograph in natural head position in order to draw the true vertical plane (TVP). The incisor mandibular plane angle (IMPA) was compensated to eliminate the variation of the mandibular plane growth type with the formula ""FMApx.- 25 (FMA) + IMPApx. = compensated IMPA (IMPACOM)"". As the data followed normal distribution determined by the KolmogorovSmirnov test, parametric tests were used for the statistical analysis, Ttest, ANOVA and Pearson coefficient correlation test. Statistical analysis was performed using a statistical significance of p <0.05. There is correlation between TVP and NB line (NB) (0.8614), Frankfort mandibular incisor angle (FMIA) (0.8894), IMPA (0.6351), Apo line (Apo) (0.609), IMPACOM (0.8895) and McHorris angle (MH) (0.7769). ANOVA showed statistically significant differences between the means for the 7 variables with 95% confidence level, P=0.0001. The multiple range test showed no significant difference among means: APoNB (0.88), IMPAMH (0.36), IMPANB (0.65), FMIAIMPACOM (0.01), FMIATVP (0.18), TVPIMPACOM (0.17). There was correlation among all reference planes. There were statistically significant differences among the means of the planes measured, except for IMPACOM, FMIA and TVP. The IMPA differed significantly from the IMPACOM. The compensated IMPA and the FMIA did not differ significantly from the TVP. The true horizontal plane was mismatched with Frankfort plane in 84% of the sample with a range of 19°.

Effects of Probiotic Supplementation on Inflammatory Markers and Glucose Homeostasis in Adults With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"<b>Background:</b> Several studies have revealed the effect of probiotic supplementation in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) on the amelioration of low-grade inflammation, which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of T2DM. However, the effects of the clinical application of probiotics on inflammation in individuals with T2DM remain inconsistent. This study aims to investigate the comprehensive effects of probiotics on inflammatory markers in adults with T2DM. <b>Methods:</b> PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science were searched to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) exploring the effect of probiotic supplementation on inflammatory markers in individuals with T2DM through March 11, 2021. Two reviewers independently screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias of the included studies. We used a random-effects model to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) between the probiotic supplementation and control groups. <b>Results:</b> Seventeen eligible studies were selected with a total of 836 participants, including 423 participants in probiotic supplementation groups and 413 participants in control groups. Our study demonstrated that compared with the control condition, probiotic intake produced a beneficial effect in reducing the levels of plasma inflammation markers, including tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) (SMD [95% CI]; -0.37 [-0.56, -0.19], <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and C-reactive protein (CRP) (SMD [95% CI]; -0.21 [-0.42, -0.01], <i>p</i> = 0.040), while it had no effect on the plasma interleukin-6 (IL-6) level (SMD [95% CI]; -0.07 [-0.27, 0.13], <i>p</i> = 0.520). In addition, our results support the notion that probiotic supplementation improves glycaemic control, as evidenced by a significant reduction in fasting blood glucose (FPG), HbA1c and HOMA-IR (SMD [95% CI]: -0.24 [-0.42, -0.05], <i>p</i> = 0.010; -0.19 [-0.37, -0.00], <i>p</i> = 0.040; -0.36 [-0.62, -0.10], <i>p</i> = 0.006, respectively). <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study revealed some beneficial effects of probiotic supplementation on improving inflammatory markers and glucose homeostasis in individuals with T2DM. Probiotics might be a potential adjuvant therapeutic approach for T2DM.","['gut microbiota', 'inflammation', 'metaanalysis', 'probiotic', 'type 2 diabetes mellitus']"
The effectiveness of psychosocial interventions on non-physiological symptoms of menopause: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Menopause, a crucial transitioning stage for women, can significantly impact mood and wellbeing. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions on non-physiological symptoms of menopause (depression, anxiety, cognition, and quality of life) through systematic review and meta-analysis.Five databases were searched from inception to August 2023 for randomized controlled trials. Pre- and post-test means and standard deviations for groups were extracted and used to calculate effect sizes. The effectiveness of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Mindfulness-Based Interventions (MBI) on depression and anxiety were examined by subgroup analysis.Thirty studies comprising 3501 women were included. From meta-analysis, mood symptoms significantly benefited from CBT (anxiety: d = -0.22, 95 % CI = -0.35, -0.10; depression: d = -0.33, 95 % CI = -0.45, -0.21) and MBI (anxiety: d = -0.56, 95 % CI = -0.74, -0.39; depression: d = -0.27, 95 % CI = -0.45, -0.09). Psychosocial interventions were also found to significantly improve cognition (d = -0.23, 95 % CI = -0.40, -0.06) and quality of life (d = -0.78, 95 % CI = -0.93, -0.63). Mean total therapy hours ('dose') was lower for CBT (11.3) than MBI (18.6), indicating reduced costs and burden for women.Data regarding menopausal status were not collected, limiting our ability to identify the optimal timing of interventions. Potential longer-term, effects of interventions were not investigated.Our review highlighted the value of psychosocial interventions in improving non-physiological symptoms (particularly depression and anxiety) during menopause, noting the heterogeneity of findings and importance of implementing effective interventions.","['Cognitive behavior therapy', 'Menopause', 'Mindfulnessbased interventions', 'Mood', 'Systematic review', 'metaanalysis']"
Contrasting socioeconomic inequality with noncommunicable diseases: Insights from a population-based survey using the concentration index in Kong cohort study.,"Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are the major causes of mortality across the globe, which impose a substantial burden on health care systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. The present study aimed to determine socioeconomic inequality in the prevalence of NCDs using the concentration index (CI).This cross-sectional study was conducted on the baseline data of the Bandar Kong cohort. The principal component analysis was used to determine people's socioeconomic status (SES). The CI and Lorenz Curve were used for the assessment of socioeconomic inequality. Multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the relationship between SES and the prevalence of NCDs. A <i>p</i> Value less than 0.05 is considered significant.Frequency and prevalence of diabetes was 653 (16.22%), hypertension 848 (21.06%), chronic lung diseases 161 (4%), epilepsy 70 (1.74%), mental disorders 191 (4.74%), stillbirth 299 (13.94%), thyroid disorders 391 (9.71%) and depression 146 (3.63%). CI for the prevalence of diabetes was [-0.107, %95 CI: -0.146 to -0.068], hypertension [-0.122, %95 CI: -0.155 to -0.088], chronic lung disease [-0.116, %95 CI: -0.202 to -0.03], psychiatric disorders [-0.230, %95 CI: -0.304 to -0.155], depression [-0.132, %95 CI: -0.220 to-0.043] and stillbirth [-0.162, %95 CI: -0.220 to -0.105]. The Gini index was negative for all these diseases, indicating that these are significantly concentrated in people of poor SES.The findings suggest that selected NCDs were concentrated among the poor and the low-income. Particular attention may be necessary to address the problem of NCDs among these groups.","['Bandar Kong cohort', 'concentration index', 'low‐income countries', 'noncommunicable disease', 'socioeconomic inequality']"
Computed tomography <i>vs</i> liver stiffness measurement and magnetic resonance imaging in evaluating esophageal varices in cirrhotic patients: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Computed tomography (CT), liver stiffness measurement (LSM), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are non-invasive diagnostic methods for esophageal varices (EV) and for the prediction of high-bleeding-risk EV (HREV) in cirrhotic patients. However, the clinical use of these methods is controversial.To evaluate the accuracy of LSM, CT, and MRI in diagnosing EV and predicting HREV in cirrhotic patients.We performed literature searches in multiple databases, including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, CNKI, and Wanfang databases, for articles that evaluated the accuracy of LSM, CT, and MRI as candidates for the diagnosis of EV and prediction of HREV in cirrhotic patients. Summary sensitivity and specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio, and the areas under the summary receiver operating characteristic curves were analyzed. The quality of the articles was assessed using the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies-2 tool. Heterogeneity was examined by <i>Q</i>-statistic test and <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> index, and sources of heterogeneity were explored using meta-regression and subgroup analysis. Publication bias was evaluated using Deek's funnel plot. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata12.0, MetaDisc1.4, and RevMan5.3.Overall, 18, 17, and 7 relevant articles on the accuracy of LSM, CT, and MRI in evaluating EV and HREV were retrieved. A significant heterogeneity was observed in all analyses (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The areas under the summary receiver operating characteristic curves of LSM, CT, and MRI in diagnosing EV and predicting HREV were 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.83-0.89), 0.91 (95%CI: 0.88-0.93), and 0.86 (95%CI: 0.83-0.89), and 0.85 (95%CI: 0.81-0.88), 0.94 (95%CI: 0.91-0.96), and 0.83 (95%CI: 0.79-0.86), respectively, with sensitivities of 0.84 (95%CI: 0.78-0.89), 0.91 (95%CI: 0.87-0.94), and 0.81 (95%CI: 0.76-0.86), and 0.81 (95%CI: 0.75-0.86), 0.88 (95%CI: 0.82-0.92), and 0.80 (95%CI: 0.72-0.86), and specificities of 0.71 (95%CI: 0.60-0.80), 0.75 (95%CI: 0.68-0.82), and 0.82 (95%CI: 0.70-0.89), and 0.73 (95%CI: 0.66-0.80), 0.87 (95%CI: 0.81-0.92), and 0.72 (95%CI: 0.62-0.80), respectively. The corresponding positive likelihood ratios were 2.91, 3.67, and 4.44, and 3.04, 6.90, and2.83; the negative likelihood ratios were 0.22, 0.12, and 0.23, and 0.26, 0.14, and 0.28; the diagnostic odds ratios were 13.01, 30.98, and 19.58, and 11.93, 49.99, and 10.00. CT scanner is the source of heterogeneity. There was no significant difference in diagnostic threshold effects (<i>P</i> > 0.05) or publication bias (<i>P ></i> 0.05).Based on the meta-analysis of observational studies, it is suggested that CT imaging, a non-invasive diagnostic method, is the best choice for the diagnosis of EV and prediction of HREV in cirrhotic patients compared with LSM and MRI.","['Esophageal varices', 'Liver cirrhosis', 'Liver stiffness measurement', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Metaanalysis', 'Multidetector computed tomography imaging']"
Exposure to endocrine-disrupting plasticisers and lung function in children and adolescents: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Exposure to endocrine-disrupting plasticisers (EDPs), such as phthalates and bisphenols, has been associated with reduced lung function in children and adolescents. However, the existing literature yields conflicting results. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to assess the epidemiologic evidence investigating the association between EDP exposure and lung function in children and adolescents. A comprehensive search of five databases identified 25 relevant studies. We employed a random-effects meta-analysis on spirometry measures. The effect size of interest was the change in lung function in standard deviation (SD) units resulting from a two-fold increase in exposure levels. We found that certain phthalates marginally reduced lung function in children. Forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) was reduced by a two-fold increase in mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP) (β = -0.025 SD, 95%CI: 0.042, -0.008), mono-ethyl-oxo-hexyl phthalate (MEOHP) (β = -0.035 SD, 95%CI: 0.057, -0.014) and mono-carboxy-nonyl phthalate (MCNP) (β = -0.024 SD, 95%CI: 0.05, -0.003). Forced vital capacity (FVC) was decreased by a two-fold increase in MBzP (β = -0.022 SD, 95%CI: 0.036, -0.008) and MEOHP (β = -0.035 SD, 95%CI: 0.057, -0.014) levels. A two-fold increase in MCNP levels was associated with lower FEV<sub>1</sub>/FVC (β = -0.023 SD, 95%CI: 0.045, -0.001). Furthermore, a two-fold increase in MEOHP levels reduced forced mid-expiratory flow (FEF<sub>25-75</sub>) (β = -0.030 SD, 95%CI: 0.055, -0.005) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) (β = -0.056 SD, 95%CI: 0.098, -0.014). Notably, associations were more pronounced in males. Given the potential for reverse causation bias, the association between childhood exposure to EDPs and lung function remains uncertain. Overall, our meta-analysis showed small reductions in lung function with higher phthalate exposure. However, future studies are warranted in younger age groups.","['Bisphenols', 'Children', 'Lung function', 'Metaanalysis', 'Phthalates', 'Systematic review']"
RASSF1A methylation as a biomarker for detection of colorectal cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Studies have validated the potential of methylated cell-free DNA as a biomarker in various tumors, and methylated DNA in plasma may be a potential biomarker for cancer.To evaluate the diagnostic value of RASSF1A methylation in plasma for colorectal cancer (CRC) and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).A total of 92 CRC patients, 67 colorectal polyp (CRP) patients, 63 HCC patients, and 66 liver cirrhosis (LC) patients were enrolled. The plasma DNA was subjected to DNA extraction, double-strand DNA concentration determination, bisulfite conversion, purification, single-strand DNA concentration determination, and digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection. The methylation rate was calculated. The diagnostic value was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC).The age and sex in the CRC and CRP groups and the HCC and LC groups were also matched. The DNA methylation rate of RASSF1A in plasma in the CRC group was 2.87 ± 1.80, and that in the CRP group was 1.50 ± 0.64. DNA methylation of RASSF1A in plasma showed a significant difference between the CRC and CRP groups. The AUC of RASSF1A methylation for discriminating the CRC and CRP groups was 0.82 (0.76-0.88). The AUCs of T1, T2, T3 and T4 CRC and CRP were 0.83 (0.72-0.95), 0.87 (0.78-0.95), 0.86 (0.77-0.95), and 0.75 (0.64-0.85), respectively. The DNA methylation rate of RASSF1A in plasma in the HCC group was 4.45 ± 2.93, and that in the LC group was 2.46 ± 2.07. DNA methylation of RASSF1A in plasma for the HCC and LC groups showed a significant difference. The AUC of RASSF1A methylation for discriminating the HCC and LC groups was 0.70 (0.60-0.79). The AUCs of T1, T2, T3 and T4 HCC and LC were 0.80 (0.61, 1.00), 0.74 (0.59-0.88), 0.60 (0.42-0.79), and 0.68 (0.53-0.82), respectively.RASSF1A methylation in plasma detected by digital PCR may be a potential biomarker for CRC and HCC.","['Colorectal cancer', 'Digital polymerase chain reaction', 'Hepatocellular carcinoma', 'Methylation', 'RASSF1A']"
The political component of COVID-19 vaccine choice: Results from a conjoint experiment.,"Prior research highlights the role of efficacy, vaccine safety, and availability in vaccine hesitancy. Research is needed to better understand the political driving forces behind COVID-19 vaccine uptake. We examine the effects of the origin of a vaccine, and approval status within the EU on vaccine choice. We also test if these effects differ by party affiliation among Hungarians.We use a conjoint experimental design to assess multiple causal relationships. Respondents choose between two hypothetical vaccine profiles randomly generated from 10 attributes. The data were gathered from an online panel in September 2022. We applied a quota for vaccination status and party preference. Three hundred twenty-four respondents evaluated 3888 randomly generated vaccine profiles.We analyse the data using an OLS estimator with standard errors clustered by respondents. To further nuance our results, we test for task, profile, and treatment heterogeneity effects.By origin, respondents prefer German (MM 0.55; 95% CI 0.52-0.58) and Hungarian (0.55; 0.52-0.59) vaccines over US (0.49; 0.45-0.52) and Chinese vaccines (0.44; 0.41-0.47). By approval status, vaccines approved by the EU (0.55, 0.52-0.57) or pending authorization (0.5, 0.48-0.53) are preferred over unauthorised ones (0.45, 0.43-0.47). Both effects are conditional on party affiliation. Government voters especially prefer Hungarian vaccines (0.6; 0.55-0.65) over others.The complexity of vaccination decisions calls for the usage of information shortcuts. Our findings demonstrate a strong political component that motivates vaccine choice. We demonstrate that politics and ideology have broken into fields of individual-level decisions such as health.","['COVID19 vaccines', 'SARSCoV2', 'Vaccination']"
Immediate Implant Placement in Non-Infected Sockets versus Infected Sockets: a Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The aim of this systematic review is to compare immediate implant placement in infected extraction sockets with non-infected extraction sockets in terms of implant survival and function.An electronic search was conducted in PubMed, ScienceDirect, ISI Web of Knowledge and Google Scholar between January 2010 and February 2020. Studies evaluating implant survival rate and main clinical parameters were included for a qualitative and quantitative analysis.In total, nine studies were included and a pool of 2281 sockets were analysed. Compared with the non-infected group, the infected group showed no significant differences in implant survival rates (risk ratio [RR] = 0.99; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.98 to 1; P = 0.08). No significant statistical differences were found in marginal bone level (mean difference [MD] = -0.03; 95% CI = -0.1 to 0.04; P = 0.41), marginal gingival level (MD = -0.07; 95% CI = -0.17 to 0.04; P = 0.23), probing depth (MD = 0.06; 95% CI = -0.24 to 0.36; P = 0.7), modified bleeding index (MD = -0.00162196; 95% CI = -0.09 to 0.09; P = 0.97) and slight but significant changes were seen in width of keratinized gingiva (MD = 0.25; 95% CI = -0.3 to 0.8; P = 0.38) between the groups at the latest follow-up.There were no significant difference in implant survival rates, marginal bone level, marginal gingival level, modified bleeding index and probing depth between infected sockets and non-infected sockets. However, slight but significant changes were seen in width of keratinized gingiva favouring the non-infected group.","['dental implantation', 'dental implants', 'infection', 'periapical granuloma', 'tooth socket']"
"Challenges Posed by COVID-19 on Doctoral Students' Wellbeing in Russia: Of International and Domestic Doctoral Students, Who Suffers More?","While universities closed, implementing remote teaching and learning in response to COVID-19, this change significantly impacted the lives of graduate students, given their exposure to unique and diverse experiences. It thus has become essential to understand the possible differences in regard to the pandemic's impact on international and domestic students.The aim of this study was to explore the consequences of the challenges posed by COVID-19 on doctoral students' wellbeing in Russia.The study surveyed 4454 doctoral students across 249 Russian public universities.The challenges posed by COVID-19 negatively affected international doctoral students' learning experience (β= -0.269, p<0.001); students' satisfaction with supervision (β= -0.098, p<0.001); dissertation experience (β= -0.039, p<0.001); and doctoral program satisfaction (β= -0.034, p<0.001). Furthermore, the challenges posed by COVID-19 affected domestic doctoral students' learning experience (β=-0.368, p<0.001); students' satisfaction with supervision (β=-0.194, p<0.001) and doctoral program satisfaction (β=-0.034, p<0.001). However, the influence of the challenges posed by COVID-19 on communication frequency was relatively positive for both international (β=0.060, p<0.001) and domestic students (β=0.021, p<0.001), and dissertation experience (β=0.061, p<0.001) was also positive for only domestic students. Furthermore, controlled factors comprising field of study (β=-0.033, p<0.001); year of study (β=0.127, p<0.001); and university region (β=-0.056, p<0.001) influenced the effect of the challenges posed by COVID-19 on international doctoral students.The COVID-19 challenges had the greatest impact on the wellbeing of international students. Furthermore, both international and domestic students' communication frequency with their supervisors underwent a relatively positive impact (which implies no effect on both categories of students). Furthermore, the challenges posed by COVID-19 had no effect on domestic students' dissertation experiences. Finally, among the controlled variables, field of study, year of study, and university region were discovered to be significant factors in relation to the challenges posed by COVID-19 for international students.","['COVID19', 'doctoral students', 'domestic', 'higher education', 'international', 'wellbeing']"
Influence of grit and healthy lifestyle behaviors on anxiety and depression in US adults at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic: Cross-sectional study.,"<b>Background:</b> The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic altered lifestyles and impacted mental health of many adults. Engaging in physical activity, avoiding prolonged sitting, and consuming a healthy diet improve mental health. The current study investigated the association between health-related lifestyle behaviors on feelings of anxiety and depression in adults during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. <b>Methods:</b> Adults (n=796) living in the United States completed an internet-based survey in Spring 2020 that included validated survey instruments for moods, physical activity, sitting and dietary behaviors. Multivariate multiple regression models were used to assess the association between health-related lifestyle behaviors and feelings of anxiety and depression. <b>Results:</b> A majority (70.7%; 95% CI: [0.607, 0.807]) of participants met physical activity (PA) guidelines, 43.7% (95% CI: [0.287, 0.587]) sat for ≥ 8 hours per day, and 87.7% (95% CI [0.807, 0.947]) ate a healthy diet. Our final models explained 6.2% and 9.8% of the variance in anxiety and depression, respectively. Vigorous PA (anxiety: B=-0.111, 95% CI: [-0.171,0.000]; depression: B=-0.111, 95% CI: [-0.186,-0.037]) and dietary behaviors (anxiety: B=-0.112, 95% CI: [-0.180,-0.444]; depression: B=-0.112, 95% CI: [-0.213,-0.076]) were associated with reduced feelings of anxiety and depression while sitting time (anxiety: B=0.119, 95% CI: [0.000,0.199]; depression: B=0.119, 95% CI: [0.199,0.199]) were associated with greater feelings of anxiety and depression. <b>Conclusion:</b> Engaging in vigorous physically activity, reducing sitting time, and consuming a healthy diet was associated with reduced feelings of anxiety and depression during the early part of the pandemic. The aforementioned modifiable lifestyle behaviors are independent of each other suggesting improvements in one behavior may improve feelings of anxiety and depression.","['Health', 'Physiology', 'Physiopathology']"
Antibody Responses to COVID-19 Vaccination in Cancer: A Systematic Review.,"After the results of phase III vaccine studies became available, the leading oncology societies recommended two doses of COVID-19 vaccination to all patients with cancer with no specific recommendation for tumor type and active treatments. However, the data on the COVID-19 vaccine efficacy in cancer patients is limited due to exclusion of cancer patients from most vaccine clinical trials. Therefore, we systemically reviewed the available evidence evaluating the antibody responses in cancer patients.We conducted a systematic search from the Pubmed database and calculated risk differences (RD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) to compare seroconversion rates between cancer patients and controls using the Review Manager software, version 5.3.Our systematic search retrieved a total 27 studies and we included 17 studies with control arms in the analyses. Cancer patients had significantly lower seroconversion rates (37.3%) than controls (74.1%) (RD: -0.44, 95% CI: -0.52, -0.35, p<0.001) with first vaccine dose. After two doses, the seroconversion rates were 99.6% in control arm and 78.3% in cancer patients (RD: -0.19, 95% CI: -0.28, -0.10, p<0.001). The difference in seroconversion rates was more pronounced patients with hematologic malignancies (72.6%) (RD: -0.25, 95% CI: -0.27, -0.22, p<0.001) than patients with solid tumors (91.6%) (RD: -0.09, 95% CI: -0.13, -0.04, p<0.003) and patients in remission (RD: -0.10, 95% CI: -0.14, -0.06, p<0.001).In conclusion, COVID-19 vaccine seroconversion rates were significantly lower in patients with hematological malignancies and patients under active treatment. Further research focusing on the approaches to improve vaccine efficacy and exploration of novel treatment options is urgently needed for these patients.","['COVID19', 'antibody', 'cancer', 'seroconversion', 'vaccination']"
"Genetic and phenotypic parameters for body weights, harvest length, and growth curve parameters in American mink.","Understanding the genetics underlying growth curve is important for selection of animals with better growth potential, but little is known about the genetics of growth curve parameters in mink. This study estimated the genetic parameters for body weights (BWs), harvest length (HL), and growth parameters derived from the Richards model. For this purpose, individual BW of 1,088 mink measured seven times in 3-wk intervals (weeks 13 to 31 of life) were used for growth curve modeling using the Richards model. The BW traits included BW at week 13 (BW13), 16 (BW16), 19 (BW19), 22 (BW22), 25 (BW25), 28 (BW28), and 31 (BW31). Univariate analyses indicated that sex and birth-year had significant effects (P < 0.05) on BW, HL, asymptotic weight (α), growth rate at mature (k), shape parameter (m), weight at the inflection point (WIP), and age at the inflection point (AIP). In contrast, the color type had only significant effect (P < 0.05) on BW31 and HL. Estimated heritabilities (±SE) were ranged from 0.36 ± 0.13 (BW13) to 0.46 ± 0.10 (BW22) for BW and were 0.51 ± 0.09, 0.29 ± 0.09, 0.30 ± 0.09, 0.33 ± 0.1, 0.44 ± 0.10, and 0.47 ± 0.10 for HL, α, k, m, WIP, and AIP, respectively. The parameter α had non-significant (P > 0.05) genetic correlations (±SE) with k (-0.21 ± 0.23) and m (-0.10 ± 0.22), suggesting that changing shape parameters (k and m) will not influence asymptotic weight (α). Strong significant (P < 0.05) phenotypic (from 0.46 ± 0.03 to 0.60 ± 0.03) and genetic (0.70±0.13 to 0.88±0.09) correlations were observed between HL and different BW measures. The α, AIP, and WIP parameters had significant (P < 0.05) genetic correlations with HL indicated that selection for higher α, AIP, and WIP values would increase HL. Parameters k and m had nonsignificant (P > 0.05) genetic correlations with HL, indicating the change of the curve shape could not influence HL. Overall, the results suggest that growth curve parameters are heritable and can respond to genetic or genomic selection for optimizing the performance in mink.","['Richards', 'genetic parameters', 'growth curve', 'mink', 'nonlinear models']"
"Utility of Serum EB Virus Zta Antibody in the Diagnostic of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma: Evidences From 2,126 Cases and 15,644 Controls.","We collected previous published data and performed a systematical assessment for the diagnostic value of serum Zta antibody in NPC patients. Using bivariate-mixed effect model, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnosis odds ratio (DOR), and summary receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We also performed subgroup analysis to explore the heterogeneity. We included 23 studies including 24 pieces of data and 17,770 study subjects (2,126 cases and 15,644 controls). The overall combined sensitivity was 0.85 (95%CI: 0.80-0.89) and the combined specificity was 0.90 (95%CI: 0.87-0.93). The summarized AUC was 0.94 with 95%CI of 0.92-0.96. The PLR was 8.9 (95%CI: 6.4-12.2) and the NLR was 0.17(95%CI: 0.12-0.23). The diagnostic odds ratio was 53 (95%CI: 32-87). For publication year, the sensitivity was 0.88 (95%CI: 0.84-0.91) and the specificity was 0.90 (95%CI: 0.84-0.93) for ≤2006. The AUC, PLR, NLR and DOR were 0.94, 8.8, 0.13, and 64. The pooled results were similar for >2006 group. For different sample size, the pooled AUC was 0.94 for ≤Median and was 0.95 for >Median that were very close to the overall estimations. For different population setting, no overlap was found in the sensitivity (0.84 vs. 0.87), specificity (0.90 vs. 0.84), PLR (8.7 vs. 5.5), NLR (0.16 vs. 0.08-0.33), DOR (49 vs. 35), and AUC (0.94 vs. 0.92) between Asian and others. The serum EBV antibody examination has high diagnostic accuracy for early-stage NPC. The diagnostic accuracy seems not to be influenced by sample size, publication year, and ethnic. Considering the few numbers of study with non-Asian population, the present results need to be confirmed in other population setting.","['EB virus', 'Zta antibody', 'diagnostic', 'metaanalysis', 'nasopharyngeal carcinoma']"
Insulin Sensitivity and Insulin Resistance in Non-Diabetic Middle-Aged Patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea Syndrome.,"Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome <b>(</b>OSAS) has been linked with abnormal glucose metabolism, insulin resistance (IR) and development of diabetes mellitus.Non-diabetic patients (n=69) with OSAS, diagnosed by polysomnography, were prospectively recruited. To evaluate IR among OSAS patients, the Homeostasis Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) and Insulin sensitivity by Quantitative Insulin sensitivity Check Index (QUICKI) were used.HOMA-IR was positively associated with body-mass index (BMI) (ρ=0.364, p=0.002), time with oxyhaemoglobin saturation <90% (ρ=0.291, p=0.015), arousal index (ρ=0.268, p=0.027), Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) score (ρ=0.293, p=0.019) and negatively with average oxyhaemoglobin saturation (ρ=-0.398, p=0.001) and minimum oxyhaemoglobin saturation (ρ=-0.327, p=0.006). QUICKI was positively associated with forced vital capacity (r=0.301, p=0.014), average oxyhaemoglobin saturation (r=0.443, p<0.001), minimum oxyhaemoglobin saturation (ρ=0.318, p=0.008), and negatively associated with sleep stage transitions (r=-0.266, p=0.032), oxygen desaturation index (r=-0.404, p=0.005), time with oxyhaemoglobin saturation <90% (r=-0.311, p=0.019), arousal index (r=-0.344, p=0.004) and ESS score (r=-0.299, p=0.016). After adjustment for age and BMI, HOMA-IR was associated with sleep stage transitions, time with oxyhaemoglobin saturation <90%, average oxyhaemoglobin saturation, minimum oxyhaemoglobin saturation and arousal index. QUICKI was associated with oxygen desaturation index, sleep stage transitions, ESS score, minimum oxyhaemoglobin saturation and arousal index.An independent association between OSAS and IR in patients without pre-existing diabetes mellitus was observed. Recurrent hypoxia and sleep fragmentation in OSAS are associated with IR in these patients.","['HOMAIR', 'Insulin resistance', 'Insulin sensitivity', 'Intermittent hypoxia', 'Obstructive sleep apnoea syndrome', 'QUICKI', 'Sleep fragmentation']"
"Effect of dietary methionine content on growth performance, carcass traits, and feather growth of Pekin duck from 15 to 35 days of age.","A study was conducted to establish the response of Pekin ducks to dietary Met from 15 to 35 d age. Experimental diets were formulated to contain 0.35, 0.45, 0.55, 0.65, and 0.75% Met (0.30, 0.39, 0.45, 0.56, and 0.68% on an analyzed basis, respectively) and 0.3% cysteine (0.25, 0.27, 0.26, 0.26, and 0.28% on an analyzed basis, respectively). Each diet was fed to 10 pens of 55 ducks/pen. Carcass yields and feather growth were determined at 28 and 35 d. Results showed that feeding 0.30% Met (0.55% Met+Cys) significantly impaired ADG, feed-to-gain (F:G) ratio, breast meat yield, and feather growth in comparison to the other dietary treatments (P < 0.05).G, carcass and breast meat weight and yield, breast skin and subcutaneous fat weight and yield, the fourth primary wing feather length, and feather coverage showed significant quadratic broken-line or quadratic polynomial response to increasing dietary Met (P < 0.05). From 15 to 28 d age, the optimal Met requirement for the BW, breast meat yield, and the fourth primary wing feather length were 0.510, 0.445, and 0.404%, respectively, based on quadratic broken-line model, and correspondingly were 0.606, 0.576, and 0.559% by quadratic regression. For ducks from 15 to 35 d age, the optimal Met requirement for BW, breast meat yield, and feather coverage were 0.468, 0.408, and 0.484%, respectively, by quadratic broken-line model, and 0.605, 0.564, and 0.612%, by quadratic regression, respectively.","['Pekin ducks', 'carcass traits', 'feather growth', 'methionine']"
Genetic Differentiation among Livestock Breeds-Values for F<sub>st</sub>.,"(1) Background: The F<sub>st</sub> statistic is widely used to characterize between-breed relationships. F<sub>st</sub> = 0.1 has frequently been taken as indicating genetic distinctiveness between breeds. This study investigates whether this is justified. (2) Methods: A database was created of 35,080 breed pairs and their corresponding F<sub>st</sub> values, deduced from microsatellite and SNP studies covering cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, horses, and chickens. Overall, 6560 (19%) of breed pairs were between breeds located in the same country, 7395 (21%) between breeds of different countries within the same region, 20,563 (59%) between breeds located far apart, and 562 (1%) between a breed and the supposed wild ancestor of the species. (3) Results: General values for between-breed F<sub>st</sub> were as follows, cattle: microsatellite 0.06-0.12, SNP 0.08-0.15; sheep: microsatellite 0.06-0.10, SNP 0.06-0.17; horses: microsatellite 0.04-0.11, SNP 0.08-0.12; goats: microsatellite 0.04-0.14, SNP 0.08-0.16; pigs: microsatellite 0.06-0.27, SNP 0.15-0.22; chickens: microsatellite 0.05-0.28, SNP 0.08-0.26. (4) Conclusions: (1) Large amounts of F<sub>st</sub> data are available for a substantial proportion of the world's livestock breeds, (2) the value for between-breed F<sub>st</sub> of 0.1 is not appropriate owing to its considerable variability, and (3) accumulated F<sub>st</sub> data may have value for interdisciplinary research.","['cattle', 'chickens', 'goats', 'horses', 'livestock biodiversity', 'microsatellites', 'pigs', 'sheep', 'singlenucleotide polymorphisms']"
"Evaluation of freezing point in milk from buffalos reared in Calabria, Italy.","Evaluation of freezing point is one of the most common technique used to detect milk adulteration such as addition of external water to increase volume. The aim of this study was to evaluate the freezing point of buffalo milk using infrared spectroscopy and to assess how it is influenced by other milk components. A total of 361 individual buffalo milk samples were collected monthly from March to August of 2017 in a dairy farm in Catanzaro district, Italy. Samples were tested for freezing point, urea, acetone and beta-hydroxybutyrate, percent of fat, protein, lactose, casein, by Fourier Transformed Spectroscopy. The pH and daily milk production were also recorded. Freezing point ranged from -0.574°C to - 0.512°C and the mean values was -0.545°C ±0.010. According to lactation stage, freezing point decreased until 210 days post-partum reaching the minimum value of -0.550°C, then it slightly increased during lactation; according to sampling month the highest and lowest values were recorded in August and June, respectively. A positive correlation between freezing point and lactose content were evidenced (r=0.1806, P<0.05). Moreover, a faintly positive correlation was also found between freezing point and beta-idroxibutirrate (r=0.0869, P<0.05) and acetone (r=0.0096, P<0.05), whereas a negative correlation with fat (r=-0.2356, P<0.05), protein (r=-0.1855, P<0.05), casein (r=-0.2127, P<0.05) and urea (r=-0.1229, P<0.05) was evidenced.","['Freezing point', 'buffalo', 'infrared spectroscopy', 'milk']"
The burden of epilepsy on long-term outcome of genetic developmental and epileptic encephalopathies: A single tertiary center longitudinal retrospective cohort study.,"This retrospective cohort analysis highlighted neurodevelopmental outcome predictors of genetic developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE).Patients' demographic, clinical and molecular genetics data were collected. All patients underwent clinical, developmental, and neuropsychological assessments.We recruited 100 participants (53 males, 47 females) with a mean follow-up lasting 10.46 ± 8.37 years. Age at epilepsy-onset was predictive of poor adaptive and cognitive functions (VABS-II score, r = 0.350, p = 0.001; BRIEF control subscale, r = -0.253; p = 0.031). Duration of epilepsy correlated negatively with IQ (r = -0.234, p = 0.019) and VABS-II score (r = -0.367, p = 0.001). Correlations were found between delayed/lacking EEG maturation/organization and IQ (r = 0.587, p = 0.001), VABS-II score (r = 0.658, p = 0.001), BRIEF-MI and BRIEF-GEC scores (r = -0.375, p = 0.001; r = -0.236, p = 0.033), ASEBA anxiety (r = -0.220, p = 0.047) and ADHD (r = -0.233, p = 0.035) scores. The number of antiseizure medications (ASMs) correlated with IQ (r = -0.414, p = 0.001), VABS-II (r = -0.496, p = 0.001), and BRIEF-MI (r = 0.294, p = 0.012) scores; while age at the beginning of therapy with ASEBA anxiety score (r = 0.272, p = 0.013). The occurrence of status epilepticus was associated with worse adaptive performances. The linear regression analysis model showed that delayed/lacking EEG maturation/organization had a significant influence on the IQ (R2 = 0.252, p < 0.001) and the BRIEF-GEC variability (R2 = 0.042, p = 0.036). The delayed/lacking EEG maturation/organization and the duration of epilepsy also had a significant influence on the VABS-II score (R2 = 0.455, p = 0.005).Age at seizure-onset, EEG maturation/organization, duration of epilepsy, occurrence of status epilepticus, age at the introduction and number of ASMs used are reliable predictors of long-term outcomes in patients with genetic DEE.","['Epilepsy', 'Genetic epilepsies', 'Neurodevelopmental disorders children', 'Outcome']"
Urinary polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and sex hormones in children and adolescents: Evidence from NHANES.,"Evidences showed that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) do harm to human body. However, the association between PAHs and sex hormones in children and adolescents remains unclear.The study aims to investigate the associations between PAHs and sex hormones in the general children and adolescent population.967 participants aged 6-19 with complete data of PAHs exposure biomarkers, covariates and sex hormones [total testosterone (TT), estradiol (E2) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG)] were recruited from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 2013-2016. Free androgen index (FAI) was calculated with TT/SHBG. Multivariate linear regression models were performed in six subgroups (male children, male adolescents, male late adolescents, female children, female adolescents and female late adolescents) to estimate the associations between sex hormone alterations and PAHs exposure.In male puberty adolescents, weighted multivariate linear regression indicated that negative trends for 2-Hydroxynaphthalene, 1-Hydroxyphenanthrene, 2&3-Hydroxyphenanthrene and E2 (2-Hydroxynaphthalene: β: -0.104, 95%CI: -0.180, -0.029, P < 0.01; 1-Hydroxyphenanthrene: β: -0.112, 95%CI: -0.206, -0.018, P = 0.019; 2&3-Hydroxyphenanthrene: β: -0.125, 95%CI: -0.232, -0.018, P = 0.022), while exposure to 2-Hydroxynaphthalene was related to TT reduction (β: -0.099, 95%CI: -0.177, -0.020, P = 0.014). Same pattern between 2&3-Hydroxyphenanthrene and E2 alteration (2&3-Hydroxyphenanthrene: β: -0.139, 95%CI: -0.236, -0.041, P < 0.01) was also observed in male late adolescents. In male children, we determined that 1-Hydroxyphenanthrene was negatively associated with SHBG (β: -0.121, 95%CI: -0.205, -0.037, P < 0.01), while the same patterns were observed in male puberty children. We did not observe any significant result in female subgroups. All these results above were determined to have q value < 0.05.PAHs exposure was associated with the alterations of sex hormones in male adolescents and children. Considering the cross-sectional study design, further large-scale epidemiological study is necessary.","['Adolescents', 'Children', 'NHANES', 'PAHs', 'Sex hormone alterations']"
Use of biplane quantitative angiographic imaging with ensemble neural networks to assess reperfusion status during mechanical thrombectomy.,"Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the main imaging modality used to assess reperfusion during mechanical thrombectomy (MT) when treating large vessel occlusion (LVO) ischemic strokes. To improve this visual and subjective assessment, hybrid models combining angiographic parametric imaging (API) with deep learning tools have been proposed. These models use convolutional neural networks (CNN) with single view individual API maps, thus restricting use of complementary information from multiple views and maps resulting in loss of relevant clinical information. This study investigates use of ensemble networks to combine hemodynamic information from multiple bi-plane API maps to assess level of reperfusion. Three-hundred-eighty-three anteroposterior (AP) and lateral view DSAs were retrospectively collected from patients who underwent MTs of anterior circulation LVOs. API peak height (PH) and area under time density curve (AUC) maps were generated. CNNs were developed to classify maps as adequate/inadequate reperfusion as labeled by two neuro-interventionalists. Outputs from individual networks were combined by weighting each output, using a grid search algorithm. Ensembled, AP-AUC, AP-PH, lateral-AUC, and lateral-PH networks achieved accuracies of 83.0% (95% confidence-interval: 81.2%-84.8%), 74.4% (72.0%-76.7%), 74.2% (72.8%-75.7%), 74.9% (72.2%-77.7%), and 76.9% (74.4%-79.5%); area under receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.86 (0.84-0.88), 0.81 (0.79-0.83), 0.83 (0.81-0.84), 0.82 (0.8-0.84), and 0.84 (0.82-0.87); and Matthews correlation coefficients of 0.66 (0.63-0.70), 0.48 (0.43-0.53), 0.49 (0.46-0.52), 0.51 (0.45-0.56), and 0.54 (0.49-0.59) respectively. Ensembled network performance was significantly better than individual networks (McNemar's p-value<0.05). This study proved feasibility of using ensemble networks to combine hemodynamic information from multiple bi-plane API maps to assess level of reperfusion during MTs.","['Ensemble network', 'acute ischemic stroke', 'angiographic parametric imaging', 'large vessel occlusion', 'machine learning', 'mechanical thrombectomy', 'thrombolysis in cerebral infarction TICI']"
Anterior direct decompression significantly relieves spinal cord high signal in patients with ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament: a case-control study.,"In patients with cervical spondylotic myelopathy caused by ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament, high cord signal (HCS) is frequently observed. However, limited research has investigated the variations in HCS improvement resulting from different surgical approaches. This study aims to explore the potential relationship between the choice of surgical approach and the postoperative improvement of intramedullary high signal in ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL) patients.We extensively reviewed the patients' medical records, based on which demographic information such as gender, age, and body mass index (BMI) were recorded, and assessed the severity of the patients' neurological status preoperatively and postoperatively by using the Japanese Orthopedic Association score (JOAs), focusing on consecutive preoperative and postoperative Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T2WI measurements, to study the statistical correlation between the improvement of HCS and the choice of surgical approach.There were no significant differences in demographic, imaging parameters, and clinical symptoms between patients undergoing anterior and posterior surgery (p > 0.05, Table 1). However, both improvement in JOAs (Recovery2) and improvement in HCS (CR2) were significantly better in the anterior surgery group two years after surgery (p < 0.05, Table 1). Multifactorial logistic regression analysis revealed that posterior surgery and higher preoperative signal change ratio (SCR) were identified as risk factors for poor HCS improvement at the two-year postoperative period (p < 0.05, Table 2).

Creatinine to Body Weight Ratio Is Associated with Incident Diabetes: Population-Based Cohort Study.,"We investigated the association between creatinine to body weight (Cre/BW) ratio and incident diabetes. In this cohort study, 9659 men and 7417 women were follow up mean (SD) 5.6 (3.5) years and 5.4 (3.4) years, respectively. For men, tertile 1 (T1; n = 3176), Cre/BW < 0.01275; tertile 2 (T2; n = 3258), 0.01275 ≤ Cre/BW < 0.0148; and tertile 3 (T3; n = 3225), Cre/BW ≥ 0.0148; and for women, T1 (n = 2,437), Cre/BMI < 0.0118; T2 (n = 2,516), 0.0118 ≤ Cre/BMI < 0.014; and T3 (n = 2477), Cre/BMI ≥ 0.014. Among them, 362 men and 102 women developed diabetes. The hazard ratios (HRs) of incident diabetes in the T2 group was 0.56 (95% CI 0.44-0.71, <i>p</i> < 0.001) in men and 0.61 (0.38-0.99, <i>p</i> = 0.045) in women and in the T3 group was 0.42 (0.32-0.54, <i>p</i> < 0.001) in men and 0.55 (0.34-0.89, <i>p</i> = 0.014) in women after adjusting for covariates, compared with the T1 group. Moreover, Δ0.001 incremental of Cre/BW is negatively associated with incident diabetes (adjusted HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.80-0.88, <i>p</i> < 0.001 for men and 0.88, 0.81-0.96, <i>p</i> = 0.003 for women). In conclusion, Cre/BW ratio is inversely related to incident diabetes. Checking Cre/BW ratios may predict future diabetes risks.","['creatinine', 'diabetes', 'epidemiology', 'muscle mass', 'skeletal muscle mass']"
Soybean Cultivar Responses to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in Field and Controlled Environment Studies.,"The responses of 12 soybean cultivars to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum were evaluated under field and controlled environment conditions. The 12 cultivars were planted in fields naturally or artificially infested with S. sclerotiorum and evaluated for disease incidence. In controlled environment studies, the cultivars were compared with respect to lesion size on detached leaves and stems inoculated with mycelial disks, incidence of stem rot following mycelial inoculation of foliage, lesion lengths on stems discolored by oxalic acid, and levels of soluble pigment(s) in stems. Significant differences (P ≤ 0.05) in disease incidence, lesion sizes, and levels of soluble pigment(s) were detected among the 12 cultivars in all evaluations, but ranking of cultivars varied among methods and experiments within methods. Corsoy 79 and S19-90 were consistently most resistant in all methods; whereas Kenwood, A2242, Bell, and Williams 82 were least resistant. Pearson correlation coefficients (R) for disease incidence between location years in field experiments (FE) ranged from 0.86 to 0.95. R values between FE and controlled environment experiments (CEE) ranged from 0.01 to 0.62 for detached leaf assays (DLA), -0.20 to 0.47 for lesion lengths on stems inoculated with mycelial disks (LLM), 0.38 to 0.45 for incidence of stem rot from mycelial inoculation of foliage (MIF), 0.08 to 0.66 for lesion lengths on stems discolored by oxalic acid (LLO), and -0.55 to -0.37 for levels of soluble stem pigment(s) (SSP). Absolute values of R between FE and CEE were 0.40 or greater in 40, 17, 33, 29, and 83% of all correlation analyses for DLA, LLM, MIF, LLO, and SSP, respectively. Spearman's coefficients of rank correlation (r <sub>s</sub>) between FE and CEE based on average performance were 0.55, -0.20, 0.40, 0.42, and -0.44 for DLA, LLM, MIF, LLO, and SSP, respectively. Disease development was slow when foliage was inoculated with a mycelial suspension. Based on experiment (E) by cultivar (C) interaction and r<sub>s</sub> values between replicate experiments within each method, determination of soluble stem pigment levels (0.86 ≤ r<sub>s</sub> ≤ 0.97; P < 0.001 for 100% of six analyses; P = 0.98 for E × C interaction) and measurement of lesion lengths on stems discolored by oxalic acid (0.27 ≤ r<sub>s</sub> ≤ 0.85; r<sub>s</sub> ≥ 0.58 and P ≤ 0.05 for 68% of 28 analyses; P = 0.07 for E × C interaction) were the most repeatable methods. The results from this study suggest that determination of levels of soluble pigments in stems, measurement of lesion lengths on stems discolored by oxalic acid, and the detached leaf assay may be better than mycelial inoculation of stems or foliage in evaluating soybean cultivars for field resistance to S. sclerotiorum.","['ascospore inoculation', 'colonized carrot inoculation', 'excised stem technique', 'limited term inoculation']"

A series of parameters for assessing pancreatic β-cells function, such as the AUC<sub>C</sub> for six time periods: 0-60 min (AUC<sub>C0-60</sub> ), 0-120 min (AUC<sub>C0-120</sub> ), 0-180 min (AUC<sub>C0-180</sub> ), 60-120 min (AUC<sub>C60-120</sub> ), 60-180 min (AUC<sub>C60-180</sub> ) and 120-180 min (AUC<sub>C120-180</sub> ); the area under the glucose-time curve for six time periods: 0-60 min (AUC<sub>G0-60</sub> ), 0-120 min (AUC<sub>G0-120</sub> ), 0-180 min (AUC<sub>G0-180</sub> ), 60-120 min (AUC<sub>G60-120</sub> ), 60-180 min (AUC<sub>G60-180</sub> ) and 120-180 min (AUC<sub>G120-180</sub> ) and their related indexes, were calculated through 0-180 min oral glucose tolerance test and C-peptide release test. We used univariate analysis to examine the potential factors affecting DR. Spearman's correlation was used to analyze the correlation between AUC<sub>C</sub> -related indexes and DR. The logistic regression model was used to investigate AUC<sub>C</sub> and its related indexes' contribution to incidence DR. A smooth curve fitting model was used to determine the correlation, non-linear relationship, and threshold effect between AUC<sub>C</sub> and DR.Of the 969 patients with type 2 diabetes, 469 (48.40%) and 500 (51.60%) were classified as the DR group and non-DR group. Compared with the non-DR group, the DR patients had lower AUC<sub>C</sub> and AUC<sub>C</sub> /AUC<sub>G</sub> . Spearman's correlation analysis showed that AUC<sub>C</sub> -related indexes were all negatively correlated with DR. The logistic regression analysis determined that there were associations between AUC<sub>C</sub> and DR in the adjusted models. The odds ratio values of AUC<sub>C0-60</sub> , AUC<sub>C0-120</sub> , AUC<sub>C0-180</sub> , AUC<sub>C0-60</sub> /AUC<sub>G0-60</sub> , AUC<sub>C0-120</sub> /AUC<sub>G0-120</sub> , AUC<sub>C0-180</sub> /AUC<sub>G0-180</sub> , AUC<sub>C60-120</sub> , AUC<sub>C60-180</sub> , AUC<sub>C120-180</sub> , AUC<sub>C60-120</sub> /AUC<sub>G60-120</sub> , AUC<sub>C60-180</sub> /AUC<sub>G60-180</sub> and AUC<sub>C120-180</sub> /AUC<sub>G120-180</sub> were 0.817 (0.750, 0.890), 0.925 (0.895, 0.955), 0.951 (0.932, 0.970), 0.143 (0.060, 0.340), 0.194 (0.093, 0.406), 0.223 (0.116, 0.427), 0.886 (0.842, 0.933), 0.939 (0.915, 0.963), 0.887 (0.846, 0.930), 0.253 (0.133, 0.479), 0.282 (0.160, 0.497) and 0.355 (0.220, 0.573), respectively. AUC<sub>C</sub> showed a non-linear relationship with DR, with an inflection point. The inflection points of AUC<sub>C180</sub> /AUC<sub>G180</sub> , AUC<sub>C60-120</sub> , AUC<sub>C60-180</sub> , AUC<sub>C120-180</sub> , AUC<sub>C60-120</sub> /AUC<sub>G60-120</sub> , AUC<sub>C60-180</sub> /AUC<sub>G60-180</sub> , AUC<sub>C120-180</sub> /AUC<sub>G120-180</sub> and DR were 17.51, 0.542, 6.6, 15.7, 8.23, 0.534, 0.593 and 0.808 (P < 0.0001). When the indexes related to the AUC<sub>C</sub> were less than the inflection point value, they were significantly negatively associated with DR.The indexes related to the AUC<sub>C</sub> for six time periods during an oral glucose tolerance test and C-peptide release test was closely associated with the incidence to DR in patients with type 2 diabetes. AUC<sub>C</sub> has the added advantage of being a cheap and convenient risk assessment over traditional ophthalmic screening.","['Area under the Cpeptide curve', 'Betacell function', 'Diabetic retinopathy']"
Automatic segmentation of human knee anatomy by a convolutional neural network applying a 3D MRI protocol.,"To study deep learning segmentation of knee anatomy with 13 anatomical classes by using a magnetic resonance (MR) protocol of four three-dimensional (3D) pulse sequences, and evaluate possible clinical usefulness.The sample selection involved 40 healthy right knee volumes from adult participants. Further, a recently injured single left knee with previous known ACL reconstruction was included as a test subject. The MR protocol consisted of the following 3D pulse sequences: T1 TSE, PD TSE, PD FS TSE, and Angio GE. The DenseVNet neural network was considered for these experiments. Five input combinations of sequences (i) T1, (ii) T1 and FS, (iii) PD and FS, (iv) T1, PD, and FS and (v) T1, PD, FS and Angio were trained using the deep learning algorithm. The Dice similarity coefficient (DSC), Jaccard index and Hausdorff were used to compare the performance of the networks.Combining all sequences collectively performed significantly better than other alternatives. The following DSCs (±standard deviation) were obtained for the test dataset: Bone medulla 0.997 (±0.002), PCL 0.973 (±0.015), ACL 0.964 (±0.022), muscle 0.998 (±0.001), cartilage 0.966 (±0.018), bone cortex 0.980 (±0.010), arteries 0.943 (±0.038), collateral ligaments 0.919 (± 0.069), tendons 0.982 (±0.005), meniscus 0.955 (±0.032), adipose tissue 0.998 (±0.001), veins 0.980 (±0.010) and nerves 0.921 (±0.071). The deep learning network correctly identified the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) tear of the left knee, thus indicating a future aid to orthopaedics.The convolutional neural network proves highly capable of correctly labeling all anatomical structures of the knee joint when applied to 3D MR sequences. We have demonstrated that this deep learning model is capable of automatized segmentation that may give 3D models and discover pathology. Both useful for a preoperative evaluation.","['Deep learning', 'Knee images segmentation', 'Magnetic Resonance Imaging', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Visualization']"
The efficacy of Chinese patent medicine intervention on blood glucose and lipid in prediabetes: A meta-analysis.,"The purpose of this study was to analyze the efficacy and safety of Chinese patent medicine in the treatment of blood glucose, blood lipid and insulin resistance in prediabetic patients through a meta-analysis of clinical trials.Randomized controlled trials of Chinese patent medicine in the treatment of prediabetes were searched in the databases of CNKI, WanFang, VIP, CBM, PubMed, Web of Science and Embase using the computer with the search deadline on June 2, 2022. The two researchers independently screened the literatures based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the fasting blood glucose, postprandial blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, insulin resistance index, blood lipids, prediabetes reversal rate and diabetes conversion rate were used as outcome indicators. The quality of the study was evaluated according to the Cochrane scale, and data were analyzed by RevMan software.Sixteen clinical trial studies were eventually fitted into, and a meta-analysis was conducted on the included studies, and the final results showed as follows: Compared with conventional lifestyle intervention, the remedy of Chinese patent medicine intervention in prediabetes patients had significant effects on the outcome indicators, such as fasting blood glucose [<i>MD</i> = -0.36, 95%<i>CI</i> = (-0.45,-0.26), <i>P</i> < 0.00001], 2 h postprandial blood glucose [<i>MD</i> = -0.71, 95%<i>CI</i> = (-0.99,-0.42), <i>P</i> < 0.00001], glycated hemoglobin [<i>MD</i> = -0.33, 95%<i>CI</i> = (-0.48,-0.19), <i>P</i> < 0.00001], BMI [<i>MD</i> = -0.82, 95%<i>CI</i> = (-1.20,-0.44), <i>P</i> < 0.0001], insulin resistance index [<i>MD</i> = -0.20, 95%<i>CI</i> = (-0.29,-0.11), <i>P</i> < 0.00001], diabetes conversion rate [<i>MD</i> = 0.49, 95%<i>CI</i> = (0.34,0.70), <i>P</i>＜0.0001], and the differences were indicated as a statistically significant. However, the outcome indexes of TC, TG, HDL-C and LDL-C in blood lipid exhibited no significant effect, and no significant difference.The results indicated that Chinese patent medicine intervention could ameliorate the outcome indicators of prediabetes with significant efficacy and good safety. Its therapeutic effect was mainly manifested in blood glucose, insulin, body weight, and diabetes conversion rate. Chinese patent medicine maybe a promising avenue for prediabetes.","['BMI', 'Blood glucose', 'Chinese patent medicine', 'Metaanalysis', 'Prediabetes', 'Routine lifestyle intervention']"
"Correlation of Coping, Mentorship, and Life Events with Burnout in Internal Medicine Residents.","Physician burnout is a widespread problem. We examined how coping, mentorship, and life events correlated with burnout in Internal Medicine Residents. We performed a cross-sectional study of survey data collected over multiple time points and used Spearman correlation of coping, mentorship, and life events to emotional exhaustion (EE) and cynicism (CYN). Burnout was assessed using the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS), coping skills were measured using the Brief COPE, mentorship with an institutional mentoring survey, and life events with a shortened Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS). Two thousand one surveys were distributed to 616 residents from 2010 to 2015. There were 1144 cases of completion of both the Brief COPE and the MBI-GS (58%), 744 of the MBI-GS and the Mentoring survey (47%), and 1138 of the MBI-GS and Life Events Scale (57%). There were correlations between acceptance (ρ 0.1-0.24), denial (ρ 0.13-0.20), substance abuse (ρ 0.15-0.22), behavioral disengagement (ρ 0.18-.037), self-blame (ρ 0.27-0.45), self-distraction (ρ 0.18-0.32) and venting (ρ 0.15-0.47) and EE. There were correlations with acceptance (ρ 0.11-0.15), denial (ρ 0.18-0.26), humor (ρ 0.13-0.20), substance abuse (ρ 0.10-0.29), behavioral disengagement (ρ 0.19-0.40), self-blame (ρ 0.24-0.35), self-distraction (ρ 0.14-0.34) and venting (ρ 0.12-0.38) and CYN. There was a negative correlation between mentorship and EE (ρ - 0.15, - 0.18) and CYN (ρ - 0.30 to - 0.20). There were correlations between life events and EE (ρ 0.15-0.20) and CYN (ρ = 0.14-0.15). Maladaptive coping mechanisms, acceptance, and life stressors correlate with burnout in internal medicine residents and mentoring may be protective.","['Burnout', 'Coping', 'Graduate medical education', 'Mentorship', 'Wellness']"
Development and Validation of a Prognostic Model to Predict the Prognosis of Patients With Retroperitoneal Liposarcoma: A Large International Population-Based Cohort Study.,"Retroperitoneal liposarcomas (RPLs), sarcoma of mesenchymal origin, are the most common soft tissue sarcomas (STS) of the retroperitoneum. Given the rarity of RPLs, the prognostic values of clinicopathological features in the patients remain unclear. The nomogram can provide a visual interface to aid in calculating the predicted probability that a patient will achieve a particular clinical endpoint and communication with patients.We included a total of 1,392 RPLs patients diagnosed between 2004 and 2015 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. For nomogram construction and validation, patients in the SEER database were divided randomly into the training cohort and internal validation cohort at a ratio of 7:3, while 65 patients with RPLs from our center between 2010 and 2016 served as the external validation cohort. The OS curves were drawn using the Kaplan-Meier method and assessed using the log-rank test. Moreover, Fine and Gray's competing-risk regression models were conducted to assess CSS. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to select the prognostic factors for survival time. We constructed a predictive nomogram based on the results of the multivariate analyses.Through univariate and multivariate analyses, it is found that age, histological grade, classification, SEER stage, surgery constitute significant risk factors for OS, and age, classification, SEER stage, AJCC M stage, surgery, and tumor size constitute risk factors for CSS. We found that the nomogram provided a good assessment of OS and CSS at 1, 3, and 5 years in patients with RPLs (1-year OS: (training cohort: AUC = 0.755 (<i>95% CI</i>, 0.714, 0.796); internal validation cohort: AUC = 0.754 (<i>95% CI</i>, 0.681, 0.827); external validation cohort: AUC = 0.793 (<i>95% CI</i>, 0.651, 0.935)); 3-year OS: (training cohort: AUC = 0.782 (<i>95% CI</i>, 0.752, 0.811); internal validation cohort: AUC = 0.788 (<i>95% CI</i>, 0.736, 0.841); external validation cohort: AUC = 0.863 (<i>95% CI</i>, 0.773, 0.954)); 5-year OS: (training cohort: AUC = 0.780 (<i>95% CI</i>, 0.752, 0.808); internal validation cohort: AUC = 0.783 (<i>95% CI</i>, 0.732, 0.834); external validation cohort: AUC = 0.854 (<i>95% CI</i>, 0.762, 0.945)); 1-year CSS: (training cohort: AUC = 0.769 (<i>95% CI</i>, 0.717, 0.821); internal validation cohort: AUC = 0.753 (<i>95% CI</i>, 0.668, 0.838); external validation cohort: AUC = 0.799 (<i>95% CI</i>, 0.616, 0.981)); 3-year CSS: (training cohort: AUC = 0.777 (<i>95% CI</i>, 0.742, 0.811); internal validation cohort: AUC = 0.787 (<i>95% CI</i>, 0.726, 0.849); external validation cohort: AUC = 0.808 (<i>95% CI</i>, 0.673, 0.943)); 5-year CSS: (training cohort: AUC = 0.773 (<i>95% CI</i>, 0.741, 0.805); internal validation cohort: AUC = 0.768 (<i>95% CI</i>, 0.709, 0.827); external validation cohort: AUC = 0.829 (<i>95% CI</i>, 0.712, 0.945))). The calibration plots for the training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts at 1-, 3-, and 5-year OS and CSS indicated that the predicted survival rates closely correspond to the actual survival rates.We constructed and externally validated an unprecedented nomogram prognostic model for patients with RPLs. The nomogram can be used as a potential, objective, and supplementary tool for clinicians to predict the prognosis of RPLs patients around the world.","['SEER database', 'nomogram', 'prognostic factors', 'retroperitoneal liposarcomas', 'survival rate']"
The Sedentary Time and Physical Activity Levels on Physical Fitness in the Elderly: A Comparative Cross Sectional Study.,"Ageing is a life-long process characterized by a progressive loss of physical fitness compromising strength, flexibility, and agility. The purpose of this study was to use accelerometry to examine the relationship between sedentary time, light physical activity (LPA), and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) with the elderly's physical fitness. Additionally, we aimed to examine the association between the aforementioned variables on older adults who fulfilled global recommendations on physical activity for health and on those who did not fulfil these recommendations.Eighty-three elderly (mean ± SD: 72.14 ± 5.61 years old) of both genders volunteered to participate in this cross-sectional study, being divided into an active group (n = 53; 71.02 ± 5.27 years old) and an inactive group (n = 30; 74.13 ± 5.72 years old) according to the established guidelines. Sedentary and physical activity times were assessed using an ActiGraph<sup>®</sup> GT1M accelerometer, whereas physical fitness was evaluated with the Senior Fitness Test.MVPA time was correlated with lower body mass index (BMI) ((r<sub>s</sub> = -0.218; <i>p</i> = 0.048; -0.3 < r ≤ -0.1 (small)) and shorter time to complete the agility test ((r<sub>s</sub> = -0.367; <i>p</i> = 0.001; -0.5 < r ≤ -0.3 (low)). Moreover, MVPA time was positively correlated with aerobic endurance ((r<sub>s</sub> = 0.397; <i>p</i> = 0.000; 0.5 < r ≤ 0.3 (low)) and strength ((r<sub>s</sub> = 0.243; <i>p</i> = 0.027; 0.3 < r ≤ 0.1 (small)). In the inactive group, MVPA time was positively correlated with upper limb flexibility ((rs = 0.400; <i>p</i> = 0.028; 0.5 < r ≤ 0.3 (low)); moreover, sedentary time was negatively correlated with upper limb flexibility ((r = -0.443; <i>p</i> = 0.014; -0.5 < r ≤ -0.3 (low)), and LPA time was negatively correlated with BMI ((r = -0.423; <i>p</i> = 0.020; -0.5 < r ≤ -0.3 (low)). In the active group, MVPA time was correlated with lower BMI ((rs = -0.320; <i>p</i> = 0.020; -0.5 < r ≤ -0.3 (low)), and shorter time to complete agility test ((rs = -0.296; <i>p</i> = 0.031; -0.3 < r ≤ -0.1 (small)).Our results reinforce the importance of promoting MVPA practice among the elderly, thereby allowing physical fitness maintenance or improvement.","['accelerometry', 'ageing', 'health', 'physical fitness', 'sedentary behaviour']"
Com yield increases relative to nonfumigant chemical control of nematodes.,"Corn yields were measured after application of nematicides in 16 experiments, mostly in medium-to-heavily textured soil, at 12 locations in Iowa during 1973-1976. The average maximum yield increase in plots treated with nematicides was 21% over yields in untreated plots. Yields were correlated negatively with nematode numbers or nematode biomass in nearly all comparisons. Correlations of nematode numbers in the soil with yield averaged -0.56 for Helicotylenchus pseudorobustus, -0.45 for Hoplolaimus galeatus, -0.51 for Pratylenchus spp., and -0.64 for Xiphinema americanum. Correlation coefficients for numbers of nematodes in the roots and yield averaged -0.63 for Pratylenchus spp. and -0.56 H. galeatus. Correlation coefficients for yield and total number of nematodes averaged -0.65 in roots and -0.55 in soils. Negative correlations also were greater for comparisons of yield with total parasitic-nematode biomass than with numbers of individual nematodes of a species or total numbers of parasitic nematodes.","['Helicotylenehus pseudorobustus', 'Hoplolaimus galeatus', 'Pratylenchus hexincisus', 'Xiphinema americanum', 'rootworms']"
"Positive Health Outcomes Associated with Live Microbe Intake from Foods, Including Fermented Foods, Assessed using the NHANES Database.","Live dietary microbes have been hypothesized to contribute to human health but direct evidence is lacking.This study aimed to determine whether the dietary consumption of live microbes is linked to improved health outcomes.Data from the NHANES 2001-2018 were used to assess microbial intake and their adjusted associations with selected physiological parameters (e.g., blood pressure, anthropometric measures, and biomarkers) among adults aged 19 y and older. Regression models were constructed to assess the microbial intake with each physiological parameter and adjusted for demographics and other covariates. Microbial intake was assessed as both a continuous variable and a 3-level categorical variable. Fermented foods were assessed in a separate model.In continuous models, an additional 100-g intake of microbe-containing foods was associated with a lower systolic blood pressure (regression coefficient: -0.331; 95% CI: -0.447, -0.215 mm Hg), C-reactive protein (-0.013; 95% CI: -0.019, -0.008 mg/dL), plasma glucose -0.347; 95% CI: -0.570, -0.124 mg/dL), plasma insulin (-0.201; 95% CI: -0.304, -0.099 μU/mL), triglyceride (-1.389; 95% CI: -2.672, -0.106 mg/dL), waist circumference (-0.554; 95% CI: -0.679, -0.428 cm), and BMI -0.217; 95% CI: -0.273, -0.160 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) levels and a higher level of high density lipoprotein cholesterols (0.432; 95% CI: 0.289, 0.574 mg/dL). Patterns were broadly similar when microbial intake was assessed categorically and when fermented foods were assessed separately.To our knowledge, this study is the first to quantify, in a nationally representative data set of American adults and using stable sets of covariates in the regression models, the adjusted associations of dietary intakes of live microbes with a variety of outcomes, such as anthropometric measures, biomarkers, and blood pressure levels. Our findings suggest that foods with higher microbial concentrations are associated with modest health improvements across a range of outcomes.","['ISAPP', 'International Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics', 'NHANES', 'fermented food', 'health promotiondisease prevention', 'live dietary microbes', 'probiotics']"
The Prevalence of Hip Pathologies in Adolescent Idiopathic Scoliosis.,"Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is the most common form of abnormal spine curvature observed in patients age 10 to 18. Typically characterized by shoulder height and waistline asymmetry, AIS may drive uneven distribution of force in the hips, leading to increased rates of concurrent hip diagnoses. The relationship between AIS and concurrent hip diagnoses is underexplored in the literature, and to date, there has been little research comparing rates of hip diagnoses between patients with AIS and those unaffected.Assess differences in rates and clusters of hip diagnoses between patients with AIS and those unaffected.Retrospective review of Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project's (HCUP) Nationwide Inpatient Sample (NIS).224,504 weighted inpatient discharges.Rates of hip diagnoses.Patients in the NIS database (2005-2013) ages 10-18 years were isolated. Patients were grouped by those diagnosed with AIS (ICD-9: 737.30) and those unaffected. Patient groups were propensity score matched (PSM) for age. Means comparison tests assessed differences in demographic, comorbidity, and diagnosis profiles between patient groups for corresponding age categories. ICD-9 codes were used to identify specific hip diagnoses.Following PSM, 24,656 AIS and 24,656 unaffected patients were included. The AIS patient group was comprised of more females (66% vs 59%) and had lower rates of obesity (2.4% vs 3.5%, both p < 0.001). Overall, 1.1% of patients had at least one hip diagnosis: congenital deformity (0.31%), developmental dysplasia (0.24%), recurrent dislocation (0.18%), isolated dislocation (0.09%), osteonecrosis (0.08%), osteochondrosis (0.07%), acquired deformity (0.03%), and osteoarthritis (0.02%). AIS patients had lower rates of osteonecrosis (0.04% vs 0.12%, p = 0.003), but higher rates of all other hip diagnoses, including dysplasia (0.41% vs 0.07%, p < 0.001), recurrent dislocation (0.32% vs 0.03%, p < 0.001), isolated dislocation (0.13% vs 0.06%, p < 0.001), and osteoarthritis (0.04% vs 0.01%, p = 0.084. Co-occurrences of hip diagnoses were relatively rare, with 0.03% patients having more than one hip diagnosis. Rates of co-occurring hip diagnoses did not differ between AIS and unaffected groups (0.04% vs 0.02%, p = 0.225).Compared to unaffected patients of similar ages, patients with AIS had higher overall rates of hip diagnoses, including dysplasia and recurrent dislocation. A higher trend of precocious osteoarthritis was also observed at a higher rate in AIS patients, although this difference was not statistically significant. Our results present an argument for surgical realignment in the coronal and sagittal planes to neutralize asymmetrical forces in the hips, and suggest the need for increased awareness and clinical screening for hip-related disorders in AIS patients.III.","['Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis AIS', 'Hipspine', 'Pediatric spine', 'Scoliosis', 'Spine']"
How effective is a powered toothbrush as compared to a manual toothbrush? A systematic review and meta-analysis of single brushing exercises.,"In adult participants, what is, following a single brushing exercise, the efficacy of a powered toothbrush (PTB) as compared to a manual toothbrush (MTB) on plaque removal?MEDLINE-PubMed and Cochrane-CENTRAL were searched from inception to February 2019. The inclusion criteria were (randomized) controlled clinical trials conducted in human subjects ≥18 years of age, in good general health and without periodontitis, orthodontic treatment, implants and/or removable prosthesis. Papers evaluating a PTB compared with a MTB in a single brushing exercise were included. When plaque scores were assessed according to the Quigley-Hein plaque index (Q&HPI) or the Rustogi modified Navy plaque index (RMNPI). From the eligible studies, data were extracted. A meta-analysis and subanalysis for brands and mode of action being oscillating-rotating (OR) and side-to-side (SS) were performed when feasible.Independent screening of 3450 unique papers resulted in 17 eligible publications presenting 36 comparisons. In total, 28 comparisons assessed toothbrushing efficacy according to the Q&HPI and eight comparisons used the RMNPI. Results showed a significant effect in favour of the PTB. The difference of Means (DiffM) was -0.14 (P < 0.001; 95%CI [-0.19; -0.09]) for the Q&HPI and -0.10 (P < 0.001; 95%CI [-0.14; -0.06]) for the RMNPI, respectively. The subanalysis on the OR mode of action showed a DiffM -0.16 (P < 0.001; 95%CI [-0.22, -0.10]) for the Q&HPI. For the SS mode of action using RMNPI, the DiffM showed -0.10 (P < 0.001; 95%CI [-0.15; -0.05]). The subanalysis for brands showed for the P&G OR PTB using the Q&HPI a DiffM of -0.15 (P < 0.001; 95%CI [-0.22; -0.08]) and the Colgate SS for RMNPI showed a DiffM of -0.15 (P < 0.001; 95%CI [-0.18; -0.12]).There is moderate certainty that the PTB was more effective than the MTB with respect to plaque removal following a single brushing exercise independent of the plaque index scale that was used.","['dental plaque', 'manual toothbrush', 'powered toothbrush', 'single brushing exercise', 'systematic review']"
"The associations between dietary fibers intake and systemic immune and inflammatory biomarkers, a multi-cycle study of NHANES 2015-2020.","In recent years, there has been considerable growth in abnormal inflammatory reactions and immune system dysfunction, which are implicated in chronic inflammatory illnesses and a variety of other conditions. Dietary fibers have emerged as potential regulators of the human immune and inflammatory response. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the associations between dietary fibers intake and systemic immune and inflammatory biomarkers.This cross-sectional study used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2015-2020). Dietary fibers intake was defined as the mean of two 24-h dietary recall interviews. The systemic immune-inflammation index (SII), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), red blood cell distribution width-to-albumin ratio (RA), ferritin, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and white blood cell (WBC) count were measured to evaluate systemic immune and inflammatory states of the body. The statistical software packages R and EmpowerStats were used to examine the associations between dietary fibers intake and systemic immune and inflammatory biomarkers.Overall, 14,392 participants were included in this study. After adjusting for age, gender, race, family monthly poverty level index, alcohol consumption, smoking status, vigorous recreational activity, body mass index, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, and dietary inflammatory index, dietary fibers intake was inversely associated with SII (β = -2.19885, 95% CI: -3.21476 to -1.18294, <i>p</i> = 0.000248), SIRI (β = -0.00642, 95% CI: -0.01021 to -0.00263, <i>p</i> = 0.001738), NLR (β = -0.00803, 95% CI: -0.01179 to -0.00427, <i>p</i> = 0.000284), RA (β = -0.00266, 95% CI: -0.00401 to -0.00131, <i>p</i> = 0.000644), ferritin (β = -0.73086, 95% CI: -1.31385 to -0.14787, <i>p</i> = 0.020716), hs-CRP (β = -0.04629, 95% CI: -0.0743 to -0.01829, <i>p</i> = 0.002119), WBC (β = -0.01624, 95% CI: -0.02685 to -0.00563, <i>p</i> = 0.004066), neutrophils (β = -0.01346, 95% CI: -0.01929 to -0.00764, <i>p</i> = 0.000064). An inverse association between dietary fibers and PLR was observed in the middle (β = -3.11979, 95% CI: -5.74119 to -0.4984, <i>p</i> = 0.028014) and the highest tertile (β = -4.48801, 95% CI: -7.92369 to -1.05234, <i>p</i> = 0.016881) and the trend test (β<sub>trend</sub> = -2.2626, 95% CI: -3.9648 to -0.5604, <i>P<sub>trend</sub></i> = 0.0150). The observed associations between dietary fibers intake and SII, SIRI, NLR, RA, ferritin, hs-CRP, WBC, and neutrophils remained robust and consistent in the sensitivity analysis. No significant interaction by race was found.Dietary fibers intake is associated with the improvement of the parameters of the immune response and inflammatory biomarkers, supporting recommendations to increase dietary fibers intake for enhanced immune health.","['National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey', 'dietary fiber', 'red blood cell distribution widthtoalbumin ratio', 'systemic immuneinflammation index', 'systemic inflammation response index']"
Therapeutic Efficacy of Piperazine Ferulate Combined With Irbesartan in Diabetic Nephropathy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Irbesartan is widely used clinically in the treatment of diabetic nephropathy (DN). It is believed that piperazine ferulate (PF) combined with irbesartan could result in an improved efficacy in the treatment of DN. We present the latest meta-analysis that details the combination of PF and irbesartan therapy.Before January 31, 2020, we searched various electronic databases for appropriate articles. Our search was not restricted by keyword or language. We then filtered all articles using certain criteria and assessed the quality of the qualified studies.The meta-analysis included 12 trials that involved 1300 patients (650 in the experimental group and 650 in the control group). The ages of the patients ranged from 30 to 79 years. Compared with irbesartan alone, the total effective rate of PF combined with irbesartan was significantly higher (odds ratio [OR] = 4.95; 95% CI, 3.11-7.58; P < 0.0001). The blood glucose level was controlled by significantly decreasing the fasting plasma glucose level (mean difference [MD] = -1.40; 95% CI, -2.70 to -0.11; P = 0.03) and 2-h plasma glucose level (MD = -1.65; 95% CI, -2.49 to -0.82; P < 0.0001). The combination therapy significantly decreased the levels of serum creatinine (MD = -10.24; 95% CI, -15.25 to -5.23; P < 0.0001), 24-h urinary protein (MD = -0.07; 95% CI, -0.09 to -0.05; P < 0.0001), urinary albumin excretion rate (MD = -22.52; 95% CI, -30.20 to -14.84; P < 0.0001), urinary β<sub>2</sub>-microglobulin (MD = -0.15; 95% CI, -0.17 to -0.13; P < 0.0001), and blood urea nitrogen (MD = -1.54; 95% CI, -2.36 to -0.72; P = 0.0002), which was beneficial for improving and protecting renal function. The renal microcirculation was improved by significantly decreasing the whole blood viscosity low shear (MD = -1.41; 95% CI, -1.84 to -0.99; P < 0.0001), whole blood viscosity high shear (MD = -0.54; 95% CI, -0.63 to -0.45; P < 0.0001), whole blood viscosity (MD = -1.31; 95% CI, -1.79 to -0.83; P < 0.0001), whole blood reduction viscosity (MD = -1.42; 95% CI, -1.79 to -1.06; P < 0.0001), platelet aggregation rate (MD = -0.42; 95% CI, -0.50 to -0.35; P < 0.0001), plasma viscosity (MD = -13.02; 95% CI, -15.47 to -10.56; P < 0.0001), and fibrinogen content (MD = -0.25; 95% CI, -0.42 to -0.09; P = 0.003).PF combined with irbesartan could improve the efficiency in the treatment of DN. However, these results should be handled carefully. These findings should be verified by several rigorous randomized controlled trials.","['diabetic nephropathy', 'irbesartan', 'metaanalysis', 'piperazine ferulate', 'systematic review']"
Role of risk perception and government regulation in reducing over-utilization of veterinary antibiotics: Evidence from hog farmers of China.,"Antibiotic residues and resistance caused by farmers' overuse of veterinary antibiotics have severely damaged global food safety, the ecological environment, and public health. How to lessen the overutilization of antibiotics is of prime concern nowadays; however, the existing literature has paid little attention. So, to fill this gap, the current study explores the role of risk perception and government regulation in reducing the over-utilization of veterinary antibiotics by gathering data from 675 hog farmers in the Hebei, Henan, Hubei, and Shandong provinces of China. The Heckman two-stage model is employed to explore the phenomenon. Meanwhile, risk perception is categorized into food security risk perception (FSRP), ecological security risk perception (ESRP), and public health risk perception (PHRP), and government regulation is measured from antibiotic prescribed policy (APP), withdrawal period policy (WPP), and antibiotic recorded policy (ARP). The results showed that the PHRP (ODC: ME = -0.073, SE = 0.018; ODG: ME = -0.125, SE = 0.047) significantly inhibits farmers' overuse of antibiotics. In contrast, the ESRP and PHRP have not shown significant results in influencing farmers' overuse of antibiotics. Moreover, the APP (ODC: ME = -0.035, SE = 0.016; ODG: ME = -0.088, SE = 0.040) and WPP (ODC: ME = -0.072, SE = 0.039; ODG: ME = -0.175, SE = 0.097) significantly reduce antibiotics overuse, but the influence of the ARP on farmers' antibiotics overuse is not apparent. Further, a moderating effect model is used to analyze the moderating effect of government regulation on farmers' overuse of antibiotics influenced by risk perception. The results showed that the APP (ODC: ME = -0.041, SE = 0.012; ODG: ME = -0.075, SE = 0.018) and WPP (ODC: ME = -0.058, SE = 0.015; ODG: ME = -0.076, SE = 0.019) positively influence farmers' overuse of antibiotics impacted by public health risk perception. In contrast, the ARP has no positive reinforcement effect. Finally, the study proposes that government should devolve the supervision power to veterinarians, strengthen the regulation policy advocacy, conduct training programs for farmers regarding skills to use antibiotics, and strengthen biosafety measures.","['Government policies', 'Heckman twostage model', 'Hog farmers', 'Risk', 'Veterinary antibiotics']"
"A Quantitative Subarachnoid Hemorrhage Grading System, Including Supratentorial and Infratentorial Cisterns, With Multiplanar Computed Tomography Reformations.","Background Subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) grading scales typically evaluate a limited number of cisterns on the axial plane. The goal of our study is to apply a simple quantitative yet comprehensive SAH grading scale to all major intracranial cisterns, including the infratentorial cisterns, with multiplanar computed tomography (CT) reformations. Methodology We performed a retrospective review of 94 consecutive cases of spontaneous SAH presenting within 72 hours of onset. SAH was categorized into five grades based on the short-axis thickness of SAH in 20 intracranial cisterns measured on the axial, coronal, and sagittal planes. Statistical analysis was performed for inter-rater agreement with kappa statistics, for inter-plane agreement by Spearman correlation statistics, and for inter-rater and inter-plane agreement by Pearson correlation statistics. Results The extended kappa coefficient for the three reviewers across all 20 cisterns varied from 0.38 (0.27, 0.50) to 0.59 (0.52, 0.65) on the axial plane. The kappa coefficient for two reviewers varied from 0.46 (0.33, 0.59) to 0.70 (0.60, 0.80) on the coronal plane and from 0.35 (0.20, 0.49) to 0.87 (0.77, 0.96) on the sagittal plane. The average grade of cisterns per case demonstrated mostly excellent correlation between the imaging planes with Spearman correlation statistics (≥0.70). Pairwise concordance correlation coefficient of the total SAH score revealed agreement ranging from 0.81 to 0.90 in all three planes. Pearson correlation statistics of the average total SAH scores revealed excellent correlation among the three planes (≥0.91). Conclusion A simple quantitative SAH grading scale can be successfully applied to the supratentorial and infratentorial cisterns in three standard CT imaging planes.","['cerebral vasospasm', 'computed tomography ct ', 'ct computed tomography imaging', 'spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage', 'subarachnoid hemorrhage']"

Eliciting health state utilities for Aromatic L-amino Acid Decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency: a UK vignette study.,"The aim of this study was to generate health state utilities for aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency, a rare genetic, lifelong neurogenerative condition predominantly manifesting in young infants.Participants were presented with health state vignettes. These had been previously developed based on published literature, clinician input, interviews with parents of AADC deficiency patients and expert opinion. A total of 5 health state vignettes were presented: bedridden, head control, sitting unsupported, standing with assistance and walking with assistance. Health state utilities (HSU) were elicited using time-trade off (TTO; 10-year time horizon) and the standard gamble (SG). The vignettes were completed online by panel participants drawn from a representative sample of the United Kingdom residential population.A total of 1598 participants completed the vignettes. Around 21% had incongruent responses (higher utilities for the bedridden compared to walking health states). Incongruent responses were associated with shorter task completion times, gender and parental status. These responses were removed from the analysis. Health state utilities (HSU) increased correspondingly as health states improved for both the TTO and SG. The mean HSU (standard deviation) for the TTO task were: bedridden state 0.49 (0.34); head control 0.54 (0.33), sitting unsupported 0.63 (0.31); standing with assistance 0.68 (0.31); and walking with assistance 0.73 (0.31). For the SG, mean health state utilities were: 0.56 (0.28), 0.57 (0.27), 0.67 (0.24), 0.70 (0.24), and 0.75 (0.25), respectively.Health state utilities were derived for AADC deficiency through a vignette study. These will be used for a cost-effectiveness model of an AADC deficiency treatment.","['AADC deficiency', 'Standard gamble', 'Time tradeoff', 'Vignettes']"

The total mean score on the DSSM was low (31.63 ± 4.69). Using multiple linear regression analysis, age ranging from 25 to 64 years old (Beta = -0.176, <i>p</i> = 0.008), having personal stigma (Beta = -0.143, <i>p</i> = 0.020) and perceived stigma (Beta = 0.127, <i>p</i> = 0.037), and having a nuclear family structure (Beta = -0.313, <i>p</i> = 0.046), good family function (Beta = 0.278, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and good help-seeking attitude (Beta = 0.159, <i>p</i> = 0.008) were associated with DSSM-knowledge. Older age (≥65 years) (Beta = -0.152, <i>p</i> = 0.034), higher CES-D scores (Beta = -0.162, <i>p</i> = 0.005), having a father with a bachelor's degree or higher level of education (Beta = -0.134, <i>p</i> = 0.047), being female (Beta = 0.147, <i>p</i> = 0.012), indicating a religious preference (Beta = 0.145, <i>p</i> = 0.017) and having good family function (Beta = 0.247, <i>p</i> = 0.001) were significantly associated with DSSM-activities. <b>Conclusions:</b> Reducing stigma related to depression and enhancing help-seeking attitudes may be potential strategies for managing depressive symptoms among Chinese community residents.","['Chinese residents', 'depression', 'selfhelp seeking', 'selfmanagement', 'stigma']"
Exercise-Based Interventions in Hemodialysis Patients: A Systematic Review with a Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"There is a lack of agreement on the efficacy of different exercise interventions in hemodialysis patients. We analyzed which exercise type is the most beneficial in terms of functional fitness and inflammation. A literature search of seven databases yielded 33 studies that met the inclusion criteria. Compared with an inactive control, the intervention group showed moderate effects (ES = 0.74; 95% CI 0.35 to 1.14; <i>p</i> < 0.001; and ES = 0.70; 95% CI 0.39 to 1.01; <i>p</i> < 0.001; respectively) on functional capacity (six-minute walk test) and oxygen consumption. Small nonsignificant effects were observed for aerobic (ES = -0.36; 95% CI -0.85 to 0.13; <i>p</i> = 0.154) and resistance (ES = -0.44; 95% CI -1.07 to 0.19; <i>p</i> = 0.169) training types, whereas moderate effects were found for combined (ES = -0.69; 95% CI -1.47 to 0.10; <i>p</i> = 0.088) training type based on a 10-repetition sit-to-stand test. Further, large and small effects were observed for aerobic (ES = -1.21; 95% CI -1.94 to -0.49; <i>p</i> = 0.001) and resistance training (ES = -0.54; 95% CI -0.90 to -0.17; <i>p</i> = 0.004) types on C-reactive protein. Overall, the results showed the numerically largest effect sizes for combined types compared to solely aerobic or resistance training types, with the differences between training types not reaching statistical significance. There was a significant modifying impact of age, training frequency, and session duration on performance and inflammatory outcomes.","['exercise', 'functional capacity', 'hemodialysis', 'inflammation', 'metaanalysis', 'oxygen consumption', 'physical performance']"

Deep learning for lung disease segmentation on CT: Which reconstruction kernel should be used?,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether a single reconstruction kernel or both high and low frequency kernels should be used for training deep learning models for the segmentation of diffuse lung disease on chest computed tomography (CT).Two annotated datasets of COVID-19 pneumonia (323,960 slices) and interstitial lung disease (ILD) (4,284 slices) were used. Annotated CT images were used to train a U-Net architecture to segment disease. All CT slices were reconstructed using both a lung kernel (LK) and a mediastinal kernel (MK). Three different trainings, resulting in three different models were compared for each disease: training on LK only, MK only or LK+MK images. Dice similarity scores (DSC) were compared using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.Models only trained on LK images performed better on LK images than on MK images (median DSC = 0.62 [interquartile range (IQR): 0.54, 0.69] vs. 0.60 [IQR: 0.50, 0.70], P < 0.001 for COVID-19 and median DSC = 0.62 [IQR: 0.56, 0.69] vs. 0.50 [IQR 0.43, 0.57], P < 0.001 for ILD). Similarly, models only trained on MK images performed better on MK images (median DSC = 0.62 [IQR: 0.53, 0.68] vs. 0.54 [IQR: 0.47, 0.63], P < 0.001 for COVID-19 and 0.69 [IQR: 0.61, 0.73] vs. 0.63 [IQR: 0.53, 0.70], P < 0.001 for ILD). Models trained on both kernels performed better or similarly than those trained on only one kernel. For COVID-19, median DSC was 0.67 (IQR: =0.59, 0.73) when applied on LK images and 0.67 (IQR: 0.60, 0.74) when applied on MK images (P < 0.001 for both). For ILD, median DSC was 0.69 (IQR: 0.63, 0.73) when applied on LK images (P = 0.006) and 0.68 (IQR: 0.62, 0.72) when applied on MK images (P > 0.99).Reconstruction kernels impact the performance of deep learning-based models for lung disease segmentation. Training on both LK and MK images improves the performance.","['Deep learning', 'Lung', 'Multidector computed tomography']"
Cost-Effectiveness Analysis of Influenza A (H1N1) Chemoprophylaxis in Brazil.,"<b>Background:</b> Oseltamivir and zanamivir are recommended for treating and preventing influenza A (H1N1) worldwide. In Brazil, this official recommendation lacks an economic evaluation. Our objective was to assess the efficiency of influenza A chemoprophylaxis in the Brazilian context. <b>Methods:</b> We assessed the cost-effectiveness of oseltamivir and zanamivir for prophylaxis of influenza for high risk population, compared to no prophylaxis, in the perspective of Brazilian public health system. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and effectiveness data were based on literature review and costs in Brazilian real (BRL) were estimated from official sources and micro-costing of 2016's H1N1 admissions at a university hospital. We used a decision-tree model considering prophylaxis and no prophylaxis and the probabilities of H1N1, ambulatory care, admission to hospital, intensive care, patient discharge, and death. Adherence and adverse events from prophylaxis were included. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was converted to 2016 United States dollar (USD). Uncertainty was assessed with univariated and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. <b>Results:</b> Adherence to prophylaxis was 0.70 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.54; 0.83]; adverse events, 0.09 (95% CI 0.02; 0.18); relative risk of H1N1 infection in chemoprophylaxis, 0.43 (95% CI 0.33; 0.57); incidence of H1N1, 0.14 (95% CI 0.11; 0.16); ambulatory care, 0.67 (95% CI 0.58; 0.75); hospital admission, 0.43 (CI 95% 0.39; 0.42); hospital mortality, 0.14 (CI 95% 0.12; 0.15); intensive care unit admission, 0.23 (95% CI 0.20; 0.27); and intensive care mortality, 0.40 (95% CI 0.29; 0.52). QALY in H1N1 state was 0.50 (95% CI 0.46; 0.53); in H1N1 inpatients, 0.23 (95% CI 0.18; 0.28); healthy, 0.885 (95% CI 0.879; 0.891); death, 0. Adverse events estimated to affect QALY in -0.185 (95% CI -0.290; -0.050). Cost for chemoprophylaxis was BRL 39.42 [standard deviation (SD) 17.94]; ambulatory care, BRL 12.47 (SD 5.21); hospital admission, BRL 5,727.59 (SD 7,758.28); intensive care admission, BRL 19,217.25 (SD 7,917.33); and adverse events, BRL 292.05 (SD 724.95). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was BRL -4,080.63 (USD -1,263.74)/QALY and -982.39 (USD -304.24)/H1N1 prevented.

Meta-analyses were performed when ≥2 studies examined the same potential predictor.A total of 71 studies, including over 12 000 patients, identified six predictors of good response: mania-depression-interval sequence [odds ratio (OR): 4.27; 95% CI: 2.61, 6.97; P < 0.001], absence of rapid cycling (OR for rapid cycling: 0.30; 95% CI: 0.17, 0.53; P < 0.001), absence of psychotic symptoms (OR for psychotic symptoms: 0.52; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.79; P = 0.002), family history of bipolar disorder (OR: 1.61; 95% CI: 1.03, 2.52; P = 0.036), shorter prelithium illness duration [standardised mean difference (SMD): -0.26; 95% CI: -0.41, -0.12; P < 0.001] and later age of onset (SMD: 0.17; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.36; P = 0.029). Additionally, higher body mass index was associated with poor response in two studies (SMD: -0.61; 95% CI: -0.90, -0.32; P < 0.001). There was weak evidence for number of episodes prior to lithium treatment (SMD: -0.42; 95% CI: -0.84, -0.01; P = 0.046), number of hospitalisations before lithium (SMD: -0.40; 95% CI: -0.81, 0.01; P = 0.055) and family history of lithium response (OR: 10.28; 95% CI: 0.66, 161.26; P = 0.097).The relative importance of these clinical characteristics should be interpreted with caution because of potential biases and confounding.","['bipolar disorder', 'clinical aspects', 'lithium']"
Effects of probiotics on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a meta-analysis.,"To investigate the relationship between the gut-liver axis and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of probiotic therapy in NAFLD.We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library and Chinese Biomedicine Database for all relevant randomized controlled trials on probiotics in patients with NAFLD/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). A statistical analysis was performed using RevMan 5.0 software.Four randomized trials involving 134 NAFLD/NASH patients were included. The results showed that probiotic therapy signiﬁcantly decreased alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), total-cholesterol (T-chol), high density lipoprotein (HDL), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) [ALT: weighted mean difference (WMD) -23.71, 95%CI: -33.46--13.95, P < 0.00001; AST: WMD -19.77, 95%CI: -32.55--7.00, P = 0.002; T-chol: WMD -0.28, 95%CI: -0.55--0.01, P = 0.04; HDL: WMD -0.09, 95%CI: -0.16-0.01, P = 0.03; TNF-α: WMD -0.32, 95%CI: -0.48--0.17, P < 0.0001; HOMA-IR: WMD -0.46, 95%CI: -0.73--0.19, P = 0.0008]. However, the use of probiotics was not associated with changes in body mass index (BMI), glucose (GLU) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) (BMI: WMD 0.05, 95%CI: -0.18-0.29, P = 0.64; GLU: WMD 0.05, 95%CI: -0.25-0.35, P = 0.76; LDL: WMD -0.38, 95%CI: -0.78-0.02, P = 0.06).Probiotic therapies can reduce liver aminotransferases, total-cholesterol, TNF-α and improve insulin resistance in NAFLD patients. Modulation of the gut microbiota represents a new treatment for NAFLD.","['Insulin resistance', 'Liver function', 'Metaanalysis', 'Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease', 'Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis', 'Probiotics']"
"Contrast medium Pd/Pa ratio in comparison to fractional flow reserve, quantitative flow ratio and instantaneous wave-free ratio for evaluation of intermediate coronary lesions.","Contrast medium Pd/Pa ratio (cFFR) was introduced as an alternative to fractional flow reserve (FFR).To assess the accuracy of cFFR in predicting of FFR, quantitative flow ratio (QFR) and instantaneous wave-free ratio (iFR).Resting Pd/Pa, cFFR, FFR, QFR, and iFR were measured in 110 intermediate coronary lesions. cFFR was obtained after intracoronary injection of contrast medium. FFR was measured after the intravenous administration of adenosine. QFR was derived from fixed empiric hyperemic flow velocity based on coronary angiography. iFR was calculated by measuring the resting pressure gradient across a coronary lesion during diastole.Forty-four patients with 110 intermediate coronary lesions were enrolled. Mean baseline Pd/Pa was 0.93 ±0.05. Mean cFFR value was similar to FFR value (0.83 ±0.09 vs. 0.81 ±0.09; <i>p</i> = 0.13) and QFR (0.81 ±0.1; <i>p</i> = 0.69) and iFR (0.90 ±0.07; <i>p</i> = 0.1). A total of 46 vessels (41.8%) had FFR ≤ 0.80, 50 (45.5%) vessels had cFFR ≤ 0.83, 44 (40.0%) vessels had QFR ≤ 0.80, and 38 (34.5%) vessels had iFR ≤ 0.89. An excellent agreement between cFFR and resting Pd/Pa, FFR, QFR, and iFR was confirmed (intraclass correlation coefficients of 0.83, 0.99, 0.98, and 0.88, respectively). The optimal cutoff value of cFFR was 0.83 for prediction of FFR ≤ 0.80 with sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 96.9%, 97.8%, and 97.3%, respectively. 100% sensitivity was observed for a cutoff value of 0.82 and 100% specificity for a cutoff value of 0.84; AUC = 0.998 (0.995-1.00); <i>p</i> < 0.001.Contrast medium Pd/Pa ratio seems to be accurate in predicting the functional significance of borderline coronary lesions assessed with FFR, iFR, and QFR.","['PdPa', 'coronary artery disease', 'fractional flow reserve', 'instantaneous wave free ratio', 'quantitative flow ratio']"
Inter-Rater Reliability of the Feline Grimace Scale in Cats Undergoing Dental Extractions.,"This study aimed to evaluate the inter-rater reliability of the Feline Grimace Scale (FGS) in cats undergoing dental extractions and the effects of the caregiver's presence on the FGS scores. Twenty-four cats (6 ± 3.3 years old; 4.9 ± 1.7 kg) undergoing oral treatment were included in a prospective, blinded, randomized, clinical study. They underwent treatment under general anesthesia (acepromazine-hydromorphone-propofol-isoflurane-meloxicam-local anesthetic blocks) at day 1 and were discharged at day 6. Images of cat faces were captured from video recordings with or without the caregiver's presence at 6 h postoperatively (day 1), day 6, and before and after rescue analgesia. Images were randomized and independently evaluated by four raters using the FGS [five action units (AU): ear position, orbital tightening, muzzle tension, whiskers change, and head position; score 0-2 for each]. Inter-rater reliability and the effects of the caregiver's presence were analyzed with intraclass correlation coefficient [single measures (95% confidence interval)] and the Wilcoxon signed-rank test, respectively (<i>p</i> < 0.05). A total of 91 images were scored. Total FGS scores showed good inter-rater reliability [0.84 (0.77-0.89)]. Reliability for each AU was: ears [0.68 (0.55-0.78)], orbital tightening [0.76 (0.65-0.84)], muzzle [0.56 (0.43-0.69)], whiskers [0.64 (0.50-0.76)], and head position [0.74 (0.63-0.82)]. The FGS scores were not different with [0.075 (0-0.325)] or without [0.088 (0-0.525)] the caregivers' presence (<i>p</i> = 0.12). The FGS is a reliable tool for pain assessment in cats undergoing dental extractions. The caregiver's presence did not affect FGS scores.","['Feline Grimace Scale', 'analgesia', 'dental pain', 'dentistry', 'facial expression', 'feline', 'pain assessment', 'periodontal disease']"
Early Recovery of Left Ventricular Function After Revascularization in Acute Coronary Syndrome.,"The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of echocardiographic techniques in detecting the early recovery of left ventricular (LV) function after revascularization in acute coronary syndrome (ACS). In 80 consecutive patients with ACS (age 55.7 ± 9.4 years, 77% male, 15% with CCS Angina III), an echocardiographic examination of left ventricle regional wall motion abnormalities (LV RWMA), peak systolic strain rate (PSSR), peak systolic strain (PSS) and end systolic strain (ESS) was performed before and after percutaneous intervention (PCI). Of the 80 patients, one vessel stenosis (>70%) was present in 53 (66%), two vessel disease in 12 (15%) and multivessel disease in 15 patients (19%). In total, 51% of patients had hypertension, 40% diabetes and 23% dyslipidemia. After PCI, regional PSS, ESS and PSSR of their segments subtended by the culprit vessel improved; left anterior descending-LAD, circumflex-LCx and right coronary-RCA (p<0.05 for all) as well as global S and SR (<i>p</i> < 0.05 for all). In univariate analysis, hypertension (HTN) (β = -0.294 (-0.313-0.047), <i>p</i> = 0.009, smoking β = -0.244 (-0.289-0.015) =0.03, WMA β = -0.317 (-0.284-0.014), <i>p</i> = 0.004 and the number of diseased vessels β = -0.256 (-0.188- 0.054) p=0.03 were predictors of delta global SR. In multivariate analysis, only HTN β = 0.263 (0.005-3.159) and the number of diseased vessels β =0.263 (0.005 - 3.159), p=0.04) predicted delta global SR. In ACS, the echocardiographic regional myocardial deformation is accurate in detecting early recovery of LV myocardial function after culprit lesion revascularization. Also, the findings of this study support the current practice regarding the crucial importance of proximal epicardial vessel PCI treatment on LV function compared to more distal lesions.","['acute coronary syndrome', 'deformation parameters', 'left ventricular function']"
Polyphenol intake and mortality: A nationwide cohort study in the adult population of Spain.,"Polyphenols are secondary metabolites present in small quantities in plant-based food and beverages, with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. Main groups of polyphenols include flavonoids, phenolic acids, stilbenes, and lignans, but their association with mortality has barely been examined. We aimed to assess the association between the intake of 23 polyphenol subgroups and all-cause, cardiovascular, and cancer mortality in a representative sample of the Spanish adult population.Population-based cohort study conducted with 12,161 individuals aged 18+ recruited in 2008-2010 and followed-up during a mean of 12.5 years. At baseline, food consumption was obtained with a validated dietary history, and the Phenol-Explorer database was used to estimate polyphenol intake. Associations were examined using Cox regression adjusted for main confounders.During follow-up, 967 all-cause deaths occurred, 219 were cardiovascular, and 277 cancer. Comparing extreme categories of consumption, hazard ratios (95% CI) of total mortality for subgroups were: dihydroflavonols 0.85 (0.72-1.00; p-trend:0.046); flavonols 0.79 (0.63-0.97; p-trend:0.04); methoxyphenols 0.75 (0.59-0.94; p-trend:0.021); tyrosols 0.80 (0.65-0.98; p-trend:0.044); alkylmethoxyphenols 0.74 (0.59-0.93; p-trend:0.007); hydroxycinnamic acids 0.79 (0.64-0.98; p-trend:0.014); and hydroxyphenilacetic acids 0.82 (0.67-0.99; p-trend:0.064). For cardiovascular mortality, hazard ratios were: methoxyphenols 0.58 (0.38-0.89; p-trend:0.010); alkylmethoxyphenols 0.59 (0.39-0.90; p-trend:0.011); hydroxycinnamic acids 0.63 (0.42-0.94; p-trend:0.020); and hydroxyphenilacetic acids 0.69 (0.48-0.99; p-trend:0.044), when comparing extreme tertiles of consumption. No statistically significant associations were observed for cancer. The main food sources for these polyphenol subgroups were red wine, leafy green vegetables, olive oil, green olives, and coffee (the latter being the major contributor of methoxyphenols, alkylmethoxyphenols, and hydroxycinnamic acids).In the Spanish adult population, intake of specific polyphenol subgroups was prospectively associated with a 20% lower all-cause mortality risk. This decrease was mainly due to a 40% lower cardiovascular mortality risk over time.","['Cancer mortality', 'Cardiovascular mortality', 'Mortality', 'Polyphenol intake', 'Spain']"
Maternal Pre-Pregnancy BMI and Gestational Weight Gain Are Associated with Preschool Children's Neuropsychological Outcomes in the APrON Cohort.,"This study examined the associations between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and gestational weight gain (GWG) and children's neuropsychological outcomes at 3 to 5 years of age. A total of 379 women and their children from the Alberta Pregnancy Outcomes and Nutrition (APrON) study participated. Covariate-adjusted robust regressions examined associations between maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, GWG class, interaction terms, and child outcomes. Each unit increase in maternal BMI was linked to a 0.48-point decrement (95% CI: -0.75 to -0.21) in children's Full Scale IQ. Higher pre-pregnancy BMI was related to poorer performance on the other intelligence indexes (<i>B</i> = -0.35 to -0.47, 95% CIs: -0.75, -0.02) and lower performance on measures of language (<i>B =</i> -0.08 to -0.09, 95% CIs: -0.16, -0.02), motor skills (<i>B</i> = -0.08 to -0.11, 95% CIs: -0.18, -0.01), and executive function (<i>B</i> = -0.09 to -0.16, 95% CIs: -0.26, -0.01). GWG below the recommended range was associated with a 4.04-point decrement (95% CI: 7.89, -0.11) in Full Scale IQ, but better performance on a spatial working memory test (<i>B</i> = 0.27, 95% CI: 0.02, 0.52). GWG above the recommended range was associated with lower language (<i>B =</i> -0.79, 95% CI: -1.52, -0.06) and memory scores (<i>B</i> = -0.93, 95% CI: -1.64, -0.22). Interactions were found between pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG on measures of intelligence and executive function. Maternal pre-pregnancy BMI and GWG are related to children's performance in various neuropsychological domains and may interact to predict outcomes. Optimizing maternal health and weight prior to conception and during pregnancy may enhance children's neuropsychological outcomes.","['APrON', 'cognitive development', 'executive function', 'gestational weight gain', 'intelligence', 'language', 'memory', 'motor skills', 'prepregnancy BMI']"
Relationship between both cardiorespiratory and muscular fitness and health-related quality of life in children and adolescents: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies.,"No review to date has evaluated the association between physical fitness and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in healthy children and adolescents. The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to examine the relationship between both cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) and muscular fitness (MF) and HRQoL in healthy subjects under 18 years of age and to describe the dimensions of HRQoL in which these relationships are more robust.The Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, SCIELO, SPORTDiscus and PEDro databases were systematically searched to collect observational studies that examined the relationship between CRF and HRQoL and between MF and HRQoL in participants under 18 years of age without any diagnosed medical condition. Pooled effect sizes (ES) were estimated for the associations between both CRF and MF and the various HRQoL dimensions.The pooled ES (95% CI) estimates for the relationship between CRF and HRQoL were as follows: 0.19 (0.10 to 0.27) for physical well-being, 0.19 (0.07 to 0.32) for psychological well-being, 0.20 (- 0.14 to 0.55) for perceived health status, 0.10 (0.00 to 0.20) for self-perception/self-esteem, 0.07 (- 0.05 to 0.19) for quality of family relationship, 0.14 (0.04 to 0.25) for quality of peer relationship, 0.17 (0.04 to 0.29) for everyday functioning at school and 0.20 (0.12 to 0.28) for total HRQoL score. The pooled ES (95% CI) estimates for the relationship between MF and HRQoL were: 0.25 (0.12 to 0.37) for physical well-being, 0.11 (0.04 to 0.17) for psychological well-being, 0.08 (0.01 to 0.15) for quality of family relationship, 0.14 (0.03 to 0.25) for quality of peer relationship, and 0.09 (0.03 to 0.14) for total HRQoL score.Our data suggest that both CRF and MF are positively associated with HRQoL, mainly in physical, psychological and peer relationships. Moreover, CRF is positively associated with school dimensions and MF is positively associated with family relationships.

Effects of peripheral active warming and passive insulation on core body temperature during feline ovariohysterectomy: a multi-arm randomized clinical trial.,"Hypothermia is a common complication of anesthesia, particularly in cats. Some veterinarians insulate the extremities of cats as a preventive measure, and there is evidence that heating the extremities of dogs decreases the rate of heat loss from the core. This study investigated whether active warming or passive insulation of the extremities of cats resulted in a slower decrease in rectal temperature during anesthesia.Female cats were assigned via block randomization to passive (cotton toddler socks), active (heated toddler socks) or control group (uncovered extremities). Rectal temperature was monitored every 5 mins from induction through return to trap/carrier (final temperature). Multivariable linear regression models were used to compare temperature (rate change and final) between groups.There were 164 cats with 1757 temperature readings. Mean total duration of anesthesia was 53 ± 13 mins. The temperature of all groups decreased linearly over time (all <i>P</i> <0.0001), with the rates of temperature decrease being -0.039°F/min (95% confidence interval [CI] -0.043 to -0.035)/-0.022°C (95% CI -0.024 to -0.019), -0.039°F/min (95% CI -0.042 to -0.035)/-0.022°C (95% CI -0.023 to -0.019) and -0.029°F/min (95% CI -0.032 to -0.025)/-0.016°C (95% CI -0.018 to -0.014) for the control, passive and active groups, respectively. The control, passive and active groups had median final temperatures of 98.4°F (interquartile range [IQR] 97.6-99.4)/36.9°C (IQR 36.4-37.4), 98.0°F (IQR 97.2-98.7)/36.7°C (IQR 36.2-37.1) and 99.1°F (IQR 97.7-100.0)/37.3°C (IQR 36.5-37.8), respectively. After controlling for weight, postinduction temperature and duration of anesthesia, and as compared with controls, the final temperature of the active group was predicted to be 0.54°F (95% CI 0.03-1.01)/0.3°C (95% CI 0.02-0.56) greater (<i>P</i> = 0.023), while the passive group was not significantly different (<i>P</i> = 0.130).The rate of rectal temperature decrease was significantly slower for the active group compared with the other groups. Although the cumulative difference in final temperature reading was modest, superior materials might enhance performance. Cotton toddler socks alone did not slow the rate of temperature decrease.","['Anesthesia', 'anaesthesia', 'highquality highvolume spay–neuter', 'hypothermia', 'shelter medicine', 'surgery', 'trap–neuter–vaccinate–return']"
Breeding value reliabilities for multiple-trait single-step genomic best linear unbiased predictor.,"Approximate multistep methods to calculate reliabilities for estimated breeding values in large genetic evaluations were developed for single-trait (ST-R<sup>2</sup>A) and multitrait (MT-R<sup>2</sup>A) single-step genomic BLUP (ssGBLUP) models. First, a traditional animal model was used to estimate the amount of nongenomic information for the genotyped animals. Second, this information was used with genomic data in a genomic BLUP model (genomic BLUP/SNP-BLUP) to approximate the total amount of information and ssGBLUP reliabilities for the genotyped animals. Finally, reliabilities for the nongenotyped animals were calculated using a traditional animal model where the increased information due to genomic data for the genotyped animals is accounted for by including pseudo-record counts for the genotyped animals. The approaches were tested using a multiple-trait ssGBLUP model on 2 data sets. The first data set (data 1) was small enough such that exact ssGBLUP model reliabilities could be computed by inversion and compared with the approximation method reliabilities. Data 1 had 46,535 first-, 35,290 second-, and 23,780 third-lactation 305-d milk yield records from 47,124 Finnish Red dairy cows. The pedigree comprised 64,808 animals, of which 19,757 were genotyped. We examined the efficiency of the MT-R<sup>2</sup>A approximation on a large data set (data 2) derived from the joint Nordic (Danish, Finnish, and Swedish) Holstein dairy cattle data. Data 2 had 17.8 million 305-d milk records from 8.3 million cows and first 3 lactations. The pedigree had 11 million animals of which 274,145 were genotyped on 46,342 SNP markers. For data 1, correlations between the exact ssGBLUP model and the ST-R<sup>2</sup>A for the genotyped (nongenotyped) animals were 0.995 (0.987), 0.965 (0.984), and 0.950 (0.983) for first, second, and third lactation, respectively. Correspondingly, correlations between exact ssGBLUP reliabilities and MT-R<sup>2</sup>A for the genotyped (nongenotyped) animals were 0.995 (0.993), 0.992 (0.991), and 0.990 (0.990) for first, second, and third lactation, respectively. The regression coefficients (b<sub>1</sub>) of ssGBLUP reliability on ST-R<sup>2</sup>A for the genotyped (nongenotyped) animals ranged from 0.87 (0.94) for first lactation to 0.68 (0.93) for third lactation, whereas for MT-R<sup>2</sup>A they were between 0.91 (0.99) for first lactation to 0.89 (0.99) for third lactation. Correspondingly, the intercepts varied from 0.11 (0.05) to 0.3 (0.06) for ST-R<sup>2</sup>A and from 0.06 (0.01) to 0.07 (0.02) for MT-R<sup>2</sup>A. The computing time for the approximation method was approximately 12% of that required by the direct exact approach. In conclusion, the developed approximate approach allows calculating estimated breeding value reliabilities in the ssGBLUP model even for large data sets.","['breeding value', 'dairy cattle', 'effective record contributions', 'genomic evaluation', 'reliability']"
Using the Scoliometer and a Surface Topography Apparatus to Check if Back Trunk Asymmetry Changes in Children and Adolescents in the Forward Flexion and Standing Erect Positions.,"Background The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the forward bending (FB) test versus the standing erect (SE) position on back trunk asymmetry (TA). The Scoliometer in the FB position and the 4D Formetric (4DF; Diers International, Schlangenbad, Germany) readings in the SE position were assessed. Method The angle of trunk inclination (ATI) was measured at the midthoracic, thoracolumbar, and lumbar levels using the Scoliometer in the FB position and the 4DF in the SE position. A total of 134 subjects attending the scoliosis clinic (86 girls and 48 boys), age ranging from seven to 18 years, were assessed. The children and adolescents were divided into three groups according to the severity of TA, symmetric group 1 (0-2 degrees), asymmetry group 2 (2 to 6 degrees), and group 3 having asymmetry of seven or more degrees. Children with leg length discrepancy were excluded from the study. The IBM SPSS v.20 package (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY) was used for analysis. Results At the midthoracic level comparing the Scoliometer to 4DF readings in males in group 1, the Wilcoxon signed ranks test was p=0.451 while for the Spearman's Rho, it was -0.138; in group 2, p=0.184 and Rho=0.204; and in group 3, p=0.109 and Rho=0.500. For females in group 1, p=0.000 while Rho=0.003; in group 2, p=0.008 and Rho=0.000, and in group 3, p=0.003 while Rho=0.642. At the thoracolumbar level in males for group 1, p=0.004 and Rho=-0.517; in group 2, p=0.006 and Rho=0.000; and in group 3, p=0.043 while Spearman's Rho=0.053. For females in group 1, p=0.000 and Rho=-0.095; in group 2, p=0.000 and Rho=-0.171; in group 3, p=0.001 while Rho= -0.081. At the lumbar level for males in group 1 p=0.000 while Rho=0.149; in group 2, p=0.003 and Rho=0.373; while in group 3, p=0.109 and Rho= (-). For females in group 1, p=0.000 while Rho=-0.072; in group 2, p=0.001 and Rho=0.168; and in group 3, p=0.068 while Rho=0.500. Conclusion The results of this study show that the back TA in children and adolescents is not similar in the FB and SE positions. This phenomenon probably is attributed to the complicated trunkal (spinal, thoracic, and pelvic) anatomy, and the results of this study may be used as a useful foundation for further understanding of torso dynamics.","['assessment', 'formetrics 4d', 'forward flexion', 'scoliometer', 'scoliosis', 'standing position']"
Liver Shear-Wave Velocity and Serum Fibrosis Markers to Diagnose Hepatic Fibrosis in Patients with Chronic Viral Hepatitis B.,"To compare several noninvasive indices of fibrosis in chronic viral hepatitis B, including liver shear-wave velocity (SWV), hyaluronic acid (HA), collagen type IV (CIV), procollagen type III (PCIII), and laminin (LN).Acoustic radiation force impulse (ARFI) was performed in 157 patients with chronic viral hepatitis B and in 30 healthy volunteers to measure hepatic SWV (m/s) in a prospective study. Serum markers were acquired on the morning of the same day of the ARFI evaluation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to evaluate and compare the accuracies of SWV and serum markers using METAVIR scoring from liver biopsy as a reference standard.The most accurate test for diagnosing fibrosis F ≥ 1 was SWV with the area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.913, followed by LN (0.744), HA (0.701), CIV (0.690), and PCIII (0.524). The best test for diagnosing F ≥ 2 was SWV (AUC of 0.851), followed by CIV (0.671), HA (0.668), LN (0.562), and PCIII (0.550). The best test for diagnosing F ≥ 3 was SWV (0.854), followed by CIV (0.693), HA (0.675), PCIII (0.591), and LN (0.548). The best test for diagnosing F = 4 was SWV (0.965), followed by CIV (0.804), PCIII (0.752), HA (0.744), and LN (0.662). SWV combined with HA and CIV did not improve diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.931 for F ≥ 1, 0.863 for F ≥ 2, 0.855 for F ≥ 3, 0.960 for F = 4).The performance of SWV in diagnosing liver fibrosis is superior to that of serum markers. However, the combination of SWV, HA, and CIV does not increase the accuracy of diagnosing liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.","['ARFI imaging', 'Chronic hepatitis B', 'Liver fibrosis', 'Serum markers']"
The effect of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids on stroke treatment and prevention: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Background: in recent years, n-3 PUFAs have been confirmed to be associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, but the link between n-3 PUFAs and stroke remains controversial. Objective: this study aimed to evaluate the association between n-3 PUFAs and stroke. Methods: we performed a comprehensive search of the following electronic databases: PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and CNKI. Literature screening and quality assessment were performed according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Cochrane's tool was used to assess the methodological components of each study, and the Stata 15.1 software was used to perform the meta-analysis. Results: a total of 18 RCTs were included, and the meta-analysis showed no differences in vascular disease-related death between the n-3 PUFA and control groups (RR, 0.95, 95 % CI: 0.89 to 1.01, p = 0.114 > 0.05). However, there was a significant difference in the lower n-3 PUFA dose subgroup (RR, 0.93, 95 % CI: 0.87 to 0.99, p = 0.034 < 0.05). Oral administration of n-3 PUFAs did not significantly reduce the risk of the following cerebrovascular accidents: stroke (RR = 1.00, 95 % CI: 0.93 to 1.07, p = 0.983 > 0.05), ischemic stroke (RR = 0.99, 95 % CI: 0.896 to 1.094, p = 0.841 > 0.05), hemorrhagic stroke (RR = 1.249, 95 % CI: 0.939 to 1.662, p = 0.127 > 0.05) and TIA (RR = 1.016, 95 % CI: 0.882 to 1.170, p = 0.824 > 0.05). The levels of TC (SMD, -0.167, 95 % CI: -0.193 to -0.141, p = 0 < 0.05) and TG (SMD, -0.065, 95 % CI: -0.087 to -0.042, p = 0 < 0.05) in the n-3 PUFA group were significantly decreased, but no significant improvement in the LDL (SMD, 0.022, 95 % CI: 0.005 to 0.040, p = 0.889 > 0.05) and HDL (SMD, 0.008, 95 % CI: -0.009 to 0.025, p = 0.368 > 0.05) levels was observed. Conclusion: this systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that treatment with low-dose n-3 PUFAs can reduce cerebrovascular disease-related death. After the oral administration of n-3 PUFAs, the levels of TC and TG decreased significantly, but n-3 PUFAs did not prevent the occurrence of cerebrovascular accidents or improve LDL or HDL levels.",['AGPI n3 Ictus Metaanálisis']
Time Trends and Educational Inequalities in Out-of-Hospital Coronary Deaths in Norway 1995-2009: A Cardiovascular Disease in Norway (CVDNOR) Project.,"Recent time trends and educational gradients characterizing out-of-hospital coronary deaths (OHCD) are poorly described.We identified all deaths from coronary heart disease occurring outside the hospital in Norway during 1995 to 2009. Time trends were explored using Poisson regression analysis with year as the independent, continuous variable. Information on the highest achieved education was obtained from The National Education Database and classified as primary (up to 10 years of compulsory education), secondary (high school or vocational school), or tertiary (college/university). Educational gradients in OHCD were explored using Poisson regression, stratified by sex and age (<70 and ≥70 years), and results were expressed as incidence rate ratios (IRRs) and 95%CIs. Of 100 783 coronary heart disease deaths, 58.8% were OHCDs. From 1995 to 2009, age-adjusted OHCD rates declined across all education categories (primary, secondary, and tertiary) in younger men (IRR=0.35; 95%CI 0.32-0.38; IRR=0.38; 95%CI 0.35-0.42; IRR=0.33; 95%CI 0.28-0.40), younger women (IRR=0.47; 95% CI 0.40-0.56; IRR=0.55; 95%CI 0.45-0.67; IRR=0.28; 95% CI 0.16-0.47), older men (IRR=0.20; 95%CI 0.19-0.22; IRR=0.20; 95%CI 0.18-0.22; IRR=0.20; 95%CI 0.17-0.23), and older women (IRR=0.26; 95%CI 0.24-0.28; IRR=0.25; 95%CI 0.23-0.28; IRR=0.28; 95%CI 0.22-0.34). Tertiary education was associated with lower risk of OHCD compared to primary education (IRR=0.37; 95%CI 0.35-0.40 in younger men, IRR=0.26; 95%CI 0.22-0.30 in younger women, IRR=0.52; 95%CI 0.49-0.55 in older men, and IRR=0.61; 95%CI 0.57-0.66 in older women). These gradients did not change over time (<i>P</i> interaction=0.25).Although OHCD rates declined substantially during 1995 to 2009, they displayed educational gradients that remained constant over time.","['Norway', 'coronary artery disease', 'educational inequalities', 'epidemiology', 'mortality', 'out‐of‐hospital coronary', 'trends']"
Correlation of gut dominant microbiota with hyperuricemia.,"To study the correlation of intestinal dominant flora with hyperuricemia, and to explore influencing factors of hyperuricemia.Data of gut dominant microbiota were collected from subjects who underwent health check-up in Shulan (Hangzhou) Hospital from January 2018 to April 2020. Subjects with high uric acid and normal uric acid were matched by propensity score matching method according to age, gender and body mass index (BMI). This resulted in 178 pairs as hyperuricemia group and control group. The gut dominant microbiota between hyperuricemia and normal control group were compared. Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficient method was used to analyze the correlation between blood uric acid and intestinal dominant flora. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the influencing factors of hyperuricemia.The abundance of <i>Atopobium</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, <i>Bacteroides</i>, <i>Enterococcus</i>, <i>Clostridium leptum</i>, <i>Fusobacterium prausnitzii</i>, <i>Bifidobacterium</i>, <i>Clostridium butyricum</i> and the ratio of <i>Bifidobacterium to Enterobacter</i> (B/E) in the hyperuricemia group were significantly lower than those in the control group (all <i>P</i><0.01). The correlation analysis showed that serum uric acid were negatively correlated with the abundance of <i>Atopobium</i> (<i>r</i>=－0.224, <i>P</i><0.01)<i>, Bacteroides</i> (<i>r</i>=－0.116, <i>P</i><0.05)<i>, Clostridium leptum</i> (<i>r</i>=－0.196, <i>P</i><0.01)<i>, Fusobacterium prausnitzii</i> (<i>r</i>=－0.244, <i>P</i><0.01)<i>, Bifidobacterium</i> (<i>r</i>=－0.237, <i>P</i><0.01)<i>, Eubacterium rectale</i> (<i>r</i>=－0.125, <i>P</i><0.05), <i>Clostridium butyricum</i> (<i>r</i>=－0.176, <i>P</i><0.01) and B/E value (<i>r</i>=－0.127, <i>P</i><0.05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that glutamyl transpeptidase was an independent risk factor for hyperuricemia (<i>OR</i>=1.007, 95%<i>CI</i>: 1.002-1.012, <i>P</i><0.05), and the <i>Atopobium</i> was an independent protective factor for hyperuricemia (<i>OR</i>=0.714, 95%<i>CI</i>: 0.605-0.842, <i>P</i><0.01).There are alterations in abundance of gut dominant microbiota in patients with hyperuricemia, and <i>Atopobium</i> abundance appears as a protective factor for hyperuricemia.","['Atopobium', 'Dominant microbiota', 'Gut microbiota', 'Hyperuricemia', 'Serum uric acid']"
Genetic polymorphisms in <i>CYP4F2</i> may be associated with lung cancer risk among females and no-smoking Chinese population.,"Our study aimed to explore the potential association of <i>CYP4F2</i> gene polymorphisms with lung cancer (LC) risk.The five variants in <i>CYP4F2</i> were genotyped using Agena MassARRAY in 507 cases and 505 controls. Genetic models and haplotypes based on logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate the potential association between <i>CYP4F2</i> polymorphisms and LC susceptibility.This study observed that rs12459936 was linked to an increased risk of LC in no-smoking participants (allele: OR = 1.38, <i>p</i> = 0.035; homozygote: OR = 2.00, <i>p</i> = 0.035; additive: OR = 1.40, <i>p</i> = 0.034) and females (allele: OR = 1.64, <i>p</i> = 0.002; homozygote: OR = 2.57, <i>p</i> = 0.006; heterozygous: OR = 2.56, <i>p</i> = 0.001; dominant: OR = 2.56, <i>p <</i> 0.002; additive: OR = 1.67, <i>p</i> = 0.002). Adversely, there was a significantly decreased LC risk for rs3093110 in no-smoking participants (heterozygous: OR = 0.56, <i>p</i> = 0.027; dominant: OR = 0.58, <i>p</i> = 0.035), rs3093193 (allele: OR = 0.66, <i>p</i> = 0.016; homozygote: OR = 0.33, <i>p</i> = 0.011; recessive: OR = 0.38, <i>p</i> = 0.021; additive: OR = 0.64, <i>p</i> = 0.014), rs3093144 (recessive: OR = 0.20, <i>p</i> = 0.045), and rs3093110 (allele: OR = 0.54, <i>p</i> = 0.010; heterozygous: OR = 0.50, <i>p</i> = 0.014; dominant: OR = 0.49, <i>p</i> = 0.010; additive: OR = 0.54, <i>p</i> = 0.011) in females.The study demonstrated that <i>CYP4F2</i> variants were associated with LC susceptibility, with evidence suggesting that this connection may be affected by gender and smoking status.","['CYP4F2', 'gender', 'lung cancer', 'single nucleotide polymorphisms', 'smoking']"
"Relationship Among Social Capital, Employment Uncertainty, Anxiety, and Suicidal Behaviors: A Chained Multi-mediator Mediation Modeling Analysis.","Social capital is a significant predictor of suicidal behaviors among Chinese rural migrants. However, the mechanism, including the impact of employment and mental health, has not been fully understood. This study aims to examine the complex relationships linking social capital to suicidal behaviors.Data were collected from a probability sample (<i>n</i> = 1,245) of rural migrants in Wuhan, China. Social capital was used to predict suicidal behaviors, with employment uncertainty as step 1 mediator and anxiety as step 2 mediator. Suicidal ideation and attempt were analyzed separately using a chained moderated mediation model. Years of migration was included as moderator in all models to control its confounding effect.Of the total sample, 50.9% were male with mean age of 32.0 (<i>SD</i> = 7.8) years. The association between social capital and suicidal ideation was significantly mediated by employment uncertainty (indirect effect [95% CI] = -0.14 [-0.24, -0.04]), but not for suicidal attempt (-0.02 [-0.20, 0.15]). Anxiety significantly mediated the same association for both suicidal ideation (-0.19 [-0.37, -0.01]) and attempt (-0.20 [-0.40, -0.01]). The chained relationship from social capital to employment uncertainty, anxiety, and suicidal behaviors was also significant with indirect effect of -0.05 [-0.09, -0.01] for both suicidal ideation and attempt. Similar results were observed for bonding and bridging capital.Social capital may exert an effect on suicidal behaviors through employment and mental health among rural migrants in China. Social capital-based suicide prevention must consider both employment and mental health problems to obtain better effects.HighlightsEmployment and anxiety mediate social capital-suicidal behavior relation.Bonding capital affects anxiety and bridging capital affects employment.There is a chained relation among social capital, employment, anxiety, and suicidal behaviors.","['Anxiety', 'employment', 'rural migrants', 'social capital', 'suicidal behaviors']"
Association of Social Support and Cognitive Aging Modified by Sex and Relationship Type: A Prospective Investigation in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing.,"We examined whether between-persons differences and within-person changes in levels of social support were associated with age-related cognitive decline and whether these associations varied by sex and by relationship type. Executive function and memory scores over 8 years (2002-2010) were analyzed by mixture models among 10,241 adults aged ≥50 years in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing. Between-persons differences and within-person changes in positive social support and negative social support were independently associated with cognitive decline in different ways according to sex and relationship type. Among men, higher-than-average positive social support from a spouse/partner was associated with slower cognitive decline (for executive function, βperson-mean×time-in-study = 0.005, 95% CI: 0.001, 0.010; for memory, βperson-mean×time-in-study = 0.006, 95% CI: 0.000, 0.012); whereas high negative social support from all relationship types was associated with accelerated decline in executive function (for all relationships combined, βperson-mean×time-in-study = -0.005, 95% CI: -0.008, -0.002). For women, higher-than-average positive social support from children (β = 0.037, 95% CI: 0.010, 0.064) and friends (β = 0.115, 95% CI: 0.081, 0.150)-but not from a spouse/partner (β = -0.034, 95% CI: -0.059, -0.009) or extended family (β = -0.035, 95% CI: -0.064, -0.006)-was associated with higher executive function. Associations between social support and age-related cognitive decline vary across different relationship types for men and women.","['cognitive aging', 'longitudinal study', 'sexspecificity', 'social network', 'social support']"
The Effects of the Movement Tempo on the One-Repetition Maximum Bench Press Results.,"Different tempos of movement can be used during resistance training, but programming them is often a trial-and-error practice, as changing the speed at which the exercise is performed does not always correspond with the tempo at which the 1-repetition-maximum occurred. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the effect of different movement tempos during the bench press (BP) exercise on the one-repetition maximum (1RM) load. Ninety men (age = 25.8 ± 5.3 years, body mass = 80.2 ± 14.9 kg), with a minimum one year of resistance training experience took part in the study. Using a randomized crossover design, each participant completed the BP 1RM test with five different movement tempos: V/0/V/0, 2/0/V/0, 5/0/V/0, 8/0/V/0 and 10/0/V/0. Repeated measures ANOVA compared the differences between the 1RM at each tempo. The 1RM load was significantly greater during V/0/V/0 and 2/0/V/0 compared to 5/0/V/0, 8/0/V/0, and 10/0/V/0 (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the 1RM load was significantly greater during 5/0/V/0 compared to 8/0/V/0 and 10/0/V/0 (p < 0.01), but there were no differences between either V/0/V/0 and 2/0/V/0 (p = 0.92) or between 8/0/V/0 and 10/0/V/0 (p = 0.08). Therefore, different movement tempos used during training should be accompanied by their own tempo-specific 1RM testing, as slower eccentric phases significantly decrease maximal concentric performance. Furthermore, 1RM test procedures should include information about the movement tempo used during the test protocol. In addition, the standardization of the tempo should be taken into account in investigations that use the 1 RM test to assess the effects of any treatment on maximal muscle strength.","['duration of repetition', 'eccentric movements', 'external load', 'maximal strength', 'resistance training']"
Should a colonoscopy be offered routinely to patients with CT proven acute diverticulitis? A retrospective cohort study and meta-analysis of best available evidence.,"The current guidelines suggest that patients should undergo endoscopic evaluation of the colonic lumen after an episode of computed tomography (CT) proven acute diverticulitis to rule out malignancy. The usefulness of routine endoscopic evaluation of CT proven diverticulitis remains unknown.To establish whether routine colonoscopy should be offered to patients after an episode of diverticulitis.We performed a retrospective study, comparing two groups: a diverticulitis group and a control group. The diverticulitis group consisted of patients undergoing a colonoscopy after an episode of diverticulitis. The control group consisted of asymptomatic patients undergoing a screening sigmoidoscopy. We also performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched electronic data resources to identify all relevant studies. The primary outcome was the number of adenomas found, while the secondary outcomes were the number of cancers and polyps identified, and the adenoma risk.68 and 1309 patients were included in the diverticulitis and control groups respectively. There was no difference in the risk of adenomas (5.9% <i>vs</i> 7.6%, <i>P =</i> 0.59), non-advanced adenomas (5.9% <i>vs</i> 6.9%, <i>P =</i> 0.75), advanced adenomas (0% <i>vs</i> 0.8%, <i>P =</i> 1), cancer (0% <i>vs</i> 0.15%, <i>P =</i> 1.00), and polyps (16.2% <i>vs</i> 14.2%, <i>P =</i> 0.65) between both groups. Meta-analysis of data from 4 retrospective observational studies, enrolling 4459 patients, showed no difference between the groups in terms of risk of adenomas (RD = -0.05, 95%CI: -0.11, 0.01, <i>P =</i> 0.10), non-advanced adenomas (RD = -0.02, 95%CI: -0.08, 0.04, <i>P =</i> 0.44), advanced adenomas (RD = -0.01, 95%CI: -0.04, 0.02, <i>P =</i> 0.36), cancer (RD = 0.01, 95%CI: -0.01, 0.03, <i>P =</i> 0.32), and polyps (RD = -0.05, 95%CI: -0.12, 0.02, <i>P =</i> 0.18).Routine colonoscopy may not be appropriate in patients with acute diverticulitis. High quality prospective studies are required for more robust conclusions.","['Colon cancer', 'Diverticulitis', 'Screening', 'Colonoscopy', 'Sigmoidoscopy']"
Depressive symptoms and other negative psychological states relate to ex vivo inflammatory responses differently for men and women: Cross-sectional and longitudinal evidence.,"An array of negative psychological states - including depressive symptoms, perceived stress, rumination, and negative affect - have been linked to immune function and inflammatory responses. Herein we show evidence of gender-dependent associations between ex vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated cytokine responses and such psychological states, in both cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses from three annual waves (N = 162 at baseline, 67.3% female). In cross-sectional analyses (at baseline), gender moderated the associations of depressive symptoms (previously reported), perceived stress (B = -0.043, 95%CI [-0.080, -0.015]), rumination (B = -0.500, [-1.015, -0.232]), negative affect (B = -0.020, [-0.020, -0.005]), and positive affect (B = 0.024, [0.008, 0.047]) with LPS-stimulated cytokine responses. In each analysis, negative psychological states were positively associated with LPS-stimulated cytokine responses among men but negatively among women (with associations for positive affect in the opposite direction). In longitudinal analyses (across three annual measurements), similar associations were seen for depressive symptoms (B = -0.024, [-0.059, -0.004]), perceived stress (B = -0.045, [-0.069, -0.024]), and rumination (B = -0.381, [-0.622, -0.120]). These results indicate that gender is a critical factor in associations between a broad array of negative psychological states and inflammatory responses and identify one pathway by which gender may influence psychosomatic health.","['Cytokine', 'Depression', 'Gender', 'Inflammation', 'Negative affect', 'Perceived stress', 'Rumination']"
"Association between NR5A2 and the risk of pancreatic cancer, especially among Caucasians: a meta-analysis of case-control studies.","Previous studies have reported that nuclear receptor subfamily 5, group A, member 2 (NR5A2) polymorphisms (rs3790843 G>A, rs3790844 T>C, rs12029406 C>T) are associated with the risk of pancreatic cancer. However, the results of epidemiological investigations are still controversial. In order to explore its potential attributing factors, we pooled the updated literatures to evaluate the association between NR5A2 polymorphism and the risk of pancreatic cancer in this meta-analysis.Databases such as PubMed, Google Scholar and China National Knowledge Infrastructure were searched for eligible articles following strict inclusion and exclusion criteria (updated to November 18, 2017). Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were computed to assess the intensity of association. In addition, heterogeneity, sensitivity analysis and publication bias were explored. All statistical analyses were conducted by STATA 14.0.Our results showed that the rs3790843 (GA vs GG: OR=0.86, CI=0.76-0.98, <i>P</i>=0.992; GA+AA vs GG: OR=0.83, CI=0.73-0.94, <i>P</i>=0.950; A vs G: OR=0.85, CI=0.78-0.93, <i>P</i>=0.802), rs3790844 (CC vs TT: OR=0.65, CI=0.54-0.78, <i>P</i>=0.617; CC vs TT+CT: OR=0.73, CI=0.62-0.85, <i>P</i>=0.742; C vs T: OR=0.78, CI=0.73-0.84, <i>P</i>=0.555) and rs12029406 (TT vs CC: OR=0.73, CI=0.61-0.89, <i>P</i>=0.483; TT vs CC+CT: OR=0.78, CI=0.66-0.92, <i>P</i>=0.648; T vs C: OR=0.87, CI=0.79-0.95, <i>P</i>=0.837) polymorphisms were associated statistically with the risk of pancreatic cancer. Furthermore, the results of subgroup analysis showed that rs3790843 and rs3790844 polymorphisms were especially related to the risk of pancreatic cancer in Caucasian population.Our results revealed that NR5A2 may have a protective effect on pancreatic cancer.

Efficacy and safety of Yangxue Qingnao Granules in treatment of migraine: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Yangxue Qingnao Granules (YXQN) is a Chinese patent medicine that has been commonly used in the clinical treatment of migraine.To assess the efficacy and safety of YXQN alone for the treatment of migraine.We searched 10 databases to identify relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before September 2022. Two review authors independently searched and screened the literature, extracted the data, and assessed the methodological quality of the studies using criteria from ROB 2.0, and analyzed the data using Review Manager 5.4 software.A total of 12 RCTs including 767 participants with migraine met the selection criteria. We divided these studies into comparisons of YXQN with placebo, routine treatment drugs, and other Chinese patent medicines. The meta-analysis showed the following: (1) Efficacy: The YXQN group outperformed the placebo group [relative risk (RR) = 0.29, 95% confidence interval (95%CI): 0.15-0.43, <i>P</i> < 0.00001], routine treatment group (RR = 0.18, 95%CI: 0.09-0.27, <i>P</i> < 0.0001), and Chinese patent medicine group (RR = 0.27, 95%CI: 0.13-0.41, <i>P</i> < 0.001); (2) frequency of headache: There was a significant difference between YXQN <i>vs</i> placebo [mean difference (MD) = -1.25, 95%CI: -1.60 to -0.90, <i>P</i> < 0.00001], routine treatment drugs (MD = -0.85, 95%CI: -1.15 to -0.56, <i>P</i> < 0.00001), and Chinese patent medicine (MD = -0.91, 95%CI: -1.35 to -0.46, <i>P</i> < 0.0001); (3) headache duration: We found great heterogeneity between studies, with no differences between YXQN and placebo (MD = -0.61, 95%CI: -1.53 to -0.31, <i>P</i> = 0.19) and routine treatment drugs (MD = -0.22, 95%CI: -0.89 to 0.46, <i>P</i> < 0.53). YXQN was more effective than other Chinese patent medicines in reducing headache duration (MD = -1.24, 95%CI: -1.70 to -0.77, <i>P</i> < 0.00001); and (4) headache severity: There was no significant difference between YXQN <i>vs</i> placebo (MD = -1.67, 95%CI: -3.52 to 0.19, <i>P</i> = 0.08), routine treatment drugs (MD = -0.53, 95%CI: -2.02 to 0.96, <i>P</i> = 0.68), and other Chinese patent medicines (MD = -0.49, 95%CI: -2.83 to 1.85, <i>P</i> = 0.68).

Association of oral microbiota with lung cancer risk in a low-income population in the Southeastern USA.,"Oral microbiome plays an important role in oral health and systemic diseases, including cancer. We aimed to prospectively investigate the association of oral microbiome with lung cancer risk.We analyzed 156 incident lung cancer cases (73 European Americans and 83 African Americans) and 156 individually matched controls nested within the Southern Community Cohort Study. Oral microbiota were assessed using 16S rRNA gene sequencing in pre-diagnostic mouth rinse samples. Paired t test and the permutational multivariate analysis of variance test were used to evaluate lung cancer risk association with alpha diversity or beta diversity, respectively. Conditional logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association of individual bacterial abundance or prevalence with lung cancer risk.No significant differences were observed for alpha or beta diversity between lung cancer cases and controls. Abundance of families Lachnospiraceae_[XIV], Peptostreptococcaceae_[XI], and Erysipelotrichaceae and species Parvimonas micra was associated with decreased lung cancer risk, with odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of 0.76 (0.59-0.98), 0.80 (0.66-0.97), 0.81 (0.67-0.99), and 0.83 (0.71-0.98), respectively (all p < 0.05). Prevalence of five pre-defined oral pathogens were not significantly associated with overall lung cancer risk. Prevalence of genus Bacteroidetes_[G-5] and species Alloprevotella sp._oral_taxon_912, Capnocytophaga sputigena, Lactococcus lactis, Peptoniphilaceae_[G-1] sp._oral_taxon_113, Leptotrichia sp._oral_taxon_225, and Fretibacterium fastidiosum was associated with decreased lung cancer risk, with ORs and 95% CIs of 0.55 (0.30-1.00), 0.36 (0.17-0.73), 0.53 (0.31-0.92), 0.43 (0.21-0.88), 0.43 (0.19-0.94), 0.57 (0.34-0.99), and 0.54 (0.31-0.94), respectively (all p < 0.05). Species L. sp._oral_taxon_225 was significantly associated with decreased lung cancer risk in African Americans (OR [95% CIs] 0.28 [0.12-0.66]; p = 0.00012).Results from this study suggest that oral microbiota may play a role in the development of lung cancer.","['16S rRNA sequencing', 'Lowincome population', 'Lung cancer', 'Oral microbiome']"
Bayesian estimation of genetic parameters for superovulatory response traits in Japanese Black donor cows using count data models.,"We estimated genetic parameters for two in vivo embryo production-related superovulatory response traits-total number of embryos and oocytes (TNE) and number of good embryos (NGE)-in Japanese Black donor cows through Bayesian count regression analysis. We used 20,257 records of superovulation treatments from 1546 Japanese Black cows, with 1102 (5.4%) zero-count records for TNE and 3533 (17.4%) for NGE. Two generalized mixed linear models (MLMs; repeatability animal models)-Poisson (POI) and zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) regression models-were fitted to the untransformed phenotypic records. A Gaussian MLM was also fitted to untransformed phenotypic records (GAU), natural log-transformed records (LOG), and records with Anscombe's variance stabilizing transformation (ANS). The estimated heritabilities and repeatabilities of TNE were 0.30 and 0.43 by POI, 0.35 and 0.47 by ZIP, 0.27 and 0.36 by GAU, 0.21 and 0.31 by LOG, and 0.24 and 0.35 by ANS, respectively. Those of NGE were 0.29 and 0.36 by POI, 0.31 and 0.40 by ZIP, 0.18 and 0.25 by GAU, 0.19 and 0.24 by LOG, and 0.20 and 0.25 by ANS, respectively. Under the ZIP, the estimated heritabilities and repeatabilities of the probability of zero counts were 0.43 and 0.71 for TNE and 0.42 and 0.51 for NGE, respectively, and the rank correlations between estimated breeding values of the 1546 donor cows for superovulation response and those for the probability of zero count were around -0.40 for TNE and -0.50 for NGE.","['Bayesian count data analysis', 'Generalized mixed linear model', 'Genetic parameter estimation', 'Japanese black cattle', 'Superovulatory response trait']"
Metformin and the Risk of Dementia in Type 2 Diabetes Patients.,"This retrospective cohort study investigated dementia risk associated with metformin use in type 2 diabetes patients by using the reimbursement database of the Taiwan's National Health Insurance. The patients had new-onset diabetes during 1999-2005 and were followed up until December 31, 2011. An unmatched cohort of 147,729 ever users and 15,676 never users of metformin were identified, and a matched-pair cohort of 15,676 ever users and 15,676 never users was created by propensity score (PS). Hazard ratios were estimated by Cox regression incorporated with the inverse probability of treatment weighting using PS. Results showed that in the unmatched cohort, 713 never users and 3943 ever users developed dementia with respective incidence of 1029.20 and 570.03 per 100,000 person-years. The overall hazard ratio was 0.550 (95% confidence interval: 0.508-0.596). The hazard ratio for the first (<27.0 months), second (27.0-58.1 months) and third (>58.1 months) tertile of cumulative duration of metformin therapy was 0.975 (0.893-1.066), 0.554 (0.506-0.607) and 0.286 (0.259-0.315), respectively. Analyses in the matched cohort showed an overall hazard ratio of 0.707 (0.632-0.791) and the hazard ratio for the respective tertile was 1.279 (1.100-1.488), 0.704 (0.598-0.829) and 0.387 (0.320-0.468). In conclusion, metformin use is associated with a reduced dementia risk.","['Taiwan', 'dementia', 'diabetes mellitus', 'metformin']"
Temporal convolutional networks allow early prediction of events in critical care.,"Clinical interventions and death in the intensive care unit (ICU) depend on complex patterns in patients' longitudinal data. We aim to anticipate these events earlier and more consistently so that staff can consider preemptive action.We use a temporal convolutional network to encode longitudinal data and a feedforward neural network to encode demographic data from 4713 ICU admissions in 2014-2018. For each hour of each admission, we predict events in the subsequent 1-6 hours. We compare performance with other models including a recurrent neural network.Our model performed similarly to the recurrent neural network for some events and outperformed it for others. This performance increase was more evident in a sensitivity analysis where the prediction timeframe was varied. Average positive predictive value (95% CI) was 0.786 (0.781-0.790) and 0.738 (0.732-0.743) for up- and down-titrating FiO2, 0.574 (0.519-0.625) for extubation, 0.139 (0.117-0.162) for intubation, 0.533 (0.492-0.572) for starting noradrenaline, 0.441 (0.433-0.448) for fluid challenge, and 0.315 (0.282-0.352) for death.Events were better predicted where their important determinants were captured in structured electronic health data, and where they occurred in homogeneous circumstances. We produce partial dependence plots that show our model learns clinically-plausible associations between its inputs and predictions.Temporal convolutional networks improve prediction of clinical events when used to represent longitudinal ICU data.","['airway extubation', 'artificial intelligence', 'critical care', 'machine learning', 'oxygen inhalation therapy']"
The Frequency of Daily Consumption of Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Is Associated with Reduced Muscle Mass Index in Adolescents.,"The consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSBs) has increased in recent years and has become a cause of concern because these beverages pose a risk to human health. Thus, we evaluated the association between SSBs consumption and muscle mass index (MMI) in adolescents. This cross-sectional study evaluated 2393 adolescents (18/19-years-old). Consumption of SSBs was analyzed based on the frequency of daily consumption and energy contribution categorized into tertiles. MMI was examined using the ratio of muscle mass (kilograms) to height (meters squared). The highest tertile of the frequency of daily SSB intake was associated with a reduced MMI in men (β = -0.31; 95%CI: -0.60, -0.01) and women (β = -0.24; 95%CI: -0.45, -0.02). However, these associations were not observed after adjusting for sugar contained in SSBs in men (β = -0.26; 95%CI: -0.69, 0.17) and for carbohydrate, lipid, and protein intake in women (β = -0.19; 95%CI: -0.42, 0.04). The highest energy contribution tertile of SSBs was associated with a reduced MMI in male adolescents (β = -0.34; 95%CI: -0.64, -0.04). This association was not observed after adjusting for intake of sugar in SSBs (β = -0.38; 95%CI: -0.75, 0.01). The frequency of daily consumption of SSBs was considered a risk factor for decreased MMI in both sexes, and the energy contribution of these drinks was a risk factor for MMI reduced only in male adolescents.","['adolescents', 'beverage', 'lean mass', 'observational study', 'sugar']"
Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Glycemic Control in Prediabetes: A Meta-Analysis.,"Clinical research results of vitamin D supplementation in the improvement of prediabetes remain controversial. Accordingly, a literature search was conducted of PubMed, Embase (Ovid), and Web of Science prior to 9 November 2021. Randomized controlled studies reported that the following indicators were included: body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), 2 h oral glucose tolerance test plasma glucose (2h-PG), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), insulin resistance by homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR), homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-B), and fasting insulin (FINS). Twenty-nine articles (<i>N</i> = 3792) were included in the present meta-analysis. Intriguingly, vitamin D supplementation resulted in a vast improvement in FBG (standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.38; 95%CI: -0.59, -0.16), HbA1c (SMD = -0.14; 95%CI: -0.22, -0.06) and FINS (SMD = 0.18; 95%CI: -0.26, -0.09), but not in other outcomes. However, preferred changes were observed in subgroups, as follows: Asia (SMD<sub>2h-PG</sub> = -0.25, 95%CI: -0.45, -0.04), study duration ≥1 year (SMD<sub>HOMA-IR</sub> = -0.44, 95%CI: -0.81, -0.06) (SMD<sub>HOMA-B</sub> = 0.34, 95%CI: 0.01, 0.66), baseline 25(OH)D < 50 nmol/L (SMD<sub>2h-PG</sub> = -0.23, 95%CI: -0.39, -0.06), and baseline 25(OH)D ≥ 50 nmol/L (SMD<sub>HOMA-IR</sub> = -0.50, 95%CI: -0.96, -0.03). In conclusion, oral supplementation of vitamin D has shown better effects in improving FBG, HbA1c, and FINS compared with controls among prediabetics; long-term vitamin D supplementation could have additional effects in participants with vitamin D deficiency for 2h-PG, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-B.","['glycemic control', 'metaanalysis', 'prediabetes', 'vitamin D']"
The Efficacy of Brief School-Based Exercise Programs in Improving Pubertal Bone Mass and Physical Fitness: A Randomized Controlled Trial.,"To examine the effects of three types of school-based exercises on bone health and physical fitness function in Chinese boys and girls.One hundred and seventy-four Chinese boys and girls were randomly assigned into four groups: (1) sham exercise (ShEx); (2) high-impact exercise (HiEx); (3) high-impact exercise with various directions (HiExVi); and (4) high-intensity interval exercise (HiInEx). Speed of sound (SOS) and physical fitness parameters were determined before and after six-month intervention.At the end of six-month intervention, participants in all groups show an increment of SOS compared with the baseline (<i>p</i> < 0.05), and the changes were higher in HiEx (mean: 38.878 m/s, 95% CI: 32.885~44.872, <i>p</i> = 0.001) and HiExVi groups (49.317 m/s, 42.737~55.897, <i>p</i> < 0.001) compared with ShEx group (20.049 m/s, 13.751~26.346). Six-month exercise training generated a reduction of percent of body fat (PBF) and waist-hip ratio (WHR) (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The decrease of PBF was greater in HiExVi (-1.222%, -1.820~-0.624, <i>p</i> = 0.012) and HiInEx groups (-1.395%, -1.809~-0.982, <i>p</i> = 0.003), whereas the reduction of WHR was larger in HiEx (-0.026, -0.039~-0.014, <i>p</i> = 0.009), HiExVi (-0.024, -0.036~-0.012, <i>p</i> = 0.021), and HiInEx groups (-0.035, -0.046~-0.024, <i>p</i> < 0.001) compared with ShEx group. Balance function (BLF), vital capacity (VC), standing long jump (SLJ), and sit up (SU) increased in all intervention groups (<i>p</i> < 0.05). The BLF increased in HiEx (6.332 s, 4.136~8.528, <i>p</i> = 0.001), HiExVi (10.489 s, 8.934~12.045, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and HiInEx groups (9.103 s, 7.430~10.776, <i>p</i> < 0.001) showed a greater change than that of ShEx group (1.727 s, 0.684~2.770). The increment of VC (273.049 mL, 199.510~346.587, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and SU (2.537 times/min, 0.639~4.435, <i>p</i> = 0.017) was higher in HiInEx group, whereas the accrual in SLJ was larger in HiExVi (7.488 cm, 4.936~10.040, <i>p</i> = 0.007) compared with ShEx group (58.902 mL, 7.990~109.814; -0.463 times/min, -2.003~1.077; 1.488 cm, -0.654~3.630).The brief school-based exercises were effective in improving schoolchildren's health, but they showed different effects, with HiEx mostly improving bone health, HiInEx largely benefiting physical fitness function, and HiExVi enhancing both bone and physical fitness.","['bone mineral density', 'highimpact exercise', 'highintensity interval training', 'physical fitness', 'schoolchildren']"
Arsenic exposure and metabolism in relation to blood pressure changes in pregnant women.,"Arsenic is concerned with cardiovascular diseases including hypertension, atherosclerosis, and endothelial dysfunction. However, what effects the arsenic exposure and the arsenic metabolism have on hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and blood pressure changes during pregnancy remain largely unknown. Our goal was to assess the associations of arsenic exposure and arsenic metabolism with HDP and blood pressure changes in pregnant women through a prospective birth cohort study. A total of 1038 women who were pregnant (52 HDP, 986 non-HDP participants) were included. Arsenic species of spot urine samples collected at three trimesters were measured, which included inorganic arsenic (iAs), monomethylated arsenic (MMA), and dimethylated arsenic (DMA). Arsenic metabolism was evaluated as the percentages of iAs, MMA, and DMA respectively (i.e., iAs%, MMA%, and DMA%). Outcomes were HDP and systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure changes during pregnancy. We employed mixed linear models to investigate the relationships between arsenic exposure and arsenic metabolism with changes in blood pressure during pregnancy. Poisson regression with a robust error variance with generalized estimating equations (GEE) estimation was used so that the associations of arsenic exposure and arsenic metabolism with HDP could be estimated. In this study, there was a significant relationship between the concentrations of urinary DMA and the weekly change in systolic blood pressure (SBP) (β = -0.10; 95% CI: -0.15, -0.05), diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (β = -0.07; 95% CI: -0.11, -0.02) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) (β = -0.08; 95% CI: -0.12, -0.04). Higher DMA% was accompanied with lesser weekly increase in SBP (β = -0.05; 95% CI: -0.10, 0.00), DBP (β = -0.06; 95% CI: -0.10, -0.01) and MAP (β = -0.06; 95% CI: -0.09, -0.01) during pregnancy. There was a positive association with the highest tertile of iAs% and weekly change of SBP (β = 0.08; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.13), DBP (β = 0.07; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.11) and MAP (β = 0.07; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.11). No association was found between each arsenic specie and arsenic metabolism marker in the first trimester and risk of HDP. Arsenic exposure and arsenic metabolism during pregnancy potentially change blood pressure of pregnant women. These findings may be significance as even modest elevation of blood pressure can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease.","['Arsenic exposure', 'Arsenic metabolism', 'Blood pressure changes', 'Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy']"
"Associations between hormonal contraception use, sociodemographic factors and mental health: a nationwide, register-based, matched case-control study.","Sociodemographic and mental health characteristics are associated with contraceptive choices. We aimed to describe the sociodemographic, reproductive and mental health characteristics of all fertile-aged women in Finland who used hormonal contraception (HC) in 2017.A nationwide, register-based study.All women living in Finland in 2017; data from the Care Register of Health Care, Medical Birth Register, Population Register Centre, Prescription Centre, Register of Induced Abortions.All women aged 15-49 with one redeemed HC prescription in 2017 (n=294 356), and a same-sized, age-matched and residence-matched, control group of non-users.Rates of HC use; associations between HC use and mental disorders, sociodemographic and reproductive characteristics.25.8% of women aged 15-49 years used HC. Women with the lowest socioeconomic levels had lower odds of using HC than women with upper-level statuses (OR, 95% CI students: 0.97, 0.94 to 0.99; entitled to pension: 0.66, 0.63 to 0.69; other: 0.87, 0.85 to 0.89; unknown: 0.90, 0.85 to 0.90). Women with the highest education (secondary: 1.46, 1.43 to 1.48; tertiary: 1.64, 1.58 to 1.70; academic: 1.60, 1.56 to 1.63) and income (second quarter: 1.57, 1.54 to 1.60; third quarter: 1.85, 1.82 to 1.89; fourth quarter: 2.01, 1.97 to 2.06), and unmarried women had higher odds of using HC than women with the lowest education and income levels, and married (0.61, 0.60 to 0.62), divorced (0.86, 0.84 to 0.88), widowed (0.73, 0.65 to 0.83) or other marital status women (0.26, 0.22 to 0.30).Parous women (0.70, 0.69 to 0.71), those with previous induced abortion(s) (0.91, 0.89 to 0.92) or recent eating (0.68, 0.62 to 0.75) or personality (0.89, 0.79 to 0.97) disorders had lower odds of HC use. Absolute risk differences between women with and without mental disorders ranged from 3.1% (anxiety disorders) to 10.1% (eating disorders).A quarter of the fertile-aged women use HC in Finland. Sociodemographic disparities persist in relation to HC use, although of small effect size. HC use is less common among women suffering from severe to moderate psychiatric disorders, especially eating disorders.","['eating disorders', 'public health', 'reproductive medicine']"
Comparing the prognostic value of geriatric health indicators: a population-based study.,"The identification of individuals at increased risk of poor health-related outcomes is a priority. Geriatric research has proposed several indicators shown to be associated with these outcomes, but a head-to-head comparison of their predictive accuracy is still lacking. We therefore aimed to compare the accuracy of five geriatric health indicators in predicting different outcomes among older persons: frailty index (FI), frailty phenotype (FP), walking speed (WS), multimorbidity, and a summary score including clinical diagnoses, functioning, and disability (the Health Assessment Tool; HAT).Data were retrieved from the Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen, an ongoing longitudinal study including 3363 people aged 60+. To inspect the accuracy of geriatric health indicators, we employed areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the prediction of 3-year and 5-year mortality, 1-year and 3-year unplanned hospitalizations (1+), and contacts with healthcare providers in the 6 months before and after baseline evaluation (2+).FI, WS, and HAT showed the best accuracy in the prediction of mortality [AUC(95%CI) for 3-year mortality 0.84 (0.82-0.86), 0.85 (0.83-0.87), 0.87 (0.85-0.88) and AUC(95%CI) for 5-year mortality 0.84 (0.82-0.86), 0.85 (0.83-0.86), 0.86 (0.85-0.88), respectively]. Unplanned hospitalizations were better predicted by the FI [AUC(95%CI) 1-year 0.73 (0.71-0.76); 3-year 0.72 (0.70-0.73)] and HAT [AUC(95%CI) 1-year 0.73 (0.71-0.75); 3-year 0.71 (0.69-0.73)]. The most accurate predictor of multiple contacts with healthcare providers was multimorbidity [AUC(95%CI) 0.67 (0.65-0.68)]. Predictions were generally less accurate among younger individuals (< 78 years old).Specific geriatric health indicators predict clinical outcomes with different accuracy. Comprehensive indicators (HAT, FI, WS) perform better in predicting mortality and hospitalization. Multimorbidity exhibits the best accuracy in the prediction of multiple contacts with providers.","['Health indicators', 'Older persons', 'Prognosis']"
Metformin and Risk of Hypertension in Taiwanese Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Whether metformin use may reduce hypertension risk has not been studied. This study investigated such possibility in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.Newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus during 1999-2005 were enrolled from the reimbursement database of the Taiwan's National Health Insurance and followed to December 31, 2011. Hypertension was defined either by a diagnosis or by a diagnosis plus the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers and/or calcium channel blockers. Analyses were conducted in a propensity score matched-pair cohort of 4810 ever users and 4810 never users. Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate the hazard ratios. Results showed that when hypertension was defined by a diagnosis, 2261 never users and 1908 ever users developed hypertension. The overall hazard ratio was 0.724 (0.681-0.769) and the hazard ratios for the first (<2.0 months), second (2.0-13.0 months) and third (>13.0 months) tertiles of cumulative duration were 0.820 (0.745-0.903), 0.692 (0.634-0.756), and 0.687 (0.630-0.749), respectively. When cumulative duration of metformin therapy was treated as a continuous variable, the hazard ratio was 0.991 (0.989-0.994) for every 1-month increment of metformin use. When hypertension was defined by a diagnosis plus the use of antihypertensive drugs, the overall hazard ratio was 0.831 (0.771-0.895), the hazard ratios for the respective tertiles were 0.868 (0.769-0.980), 0.852 (0.767-0.946), and 0.787 (0.709-0.874), and the hazard ratio was 0.994 (0.991-0.997) for every 1-month increment of metformin use.A reduced risk of hypertension is observed in metformin users in a dose-response pattern.","['database', 'diabetes mellitus', 'hypertension', 'metformin']"
Firearm Storage in Gun-Owning Households with Children: Results of a 2015 National Survey.,"Data from a nationally representative probability-based online survey sample of US adults conducted in 2015 (n = 3949, response rate 55%) were used to assess self-reported gun storage practices among gun owners with children. The presence of firearms and children in the home, along with other household and individual level characteristics, was ascertained from all respondents. Questions pertaining to household firearms (how guns are stored, number, type, etc.) were asked only of those respondents who reported that they personally owned a gun. We found that approximately one in three US households contains at least one firearm, regardless of whether children lived in the home (0.34 [0.29-0.39]) or not (0.35 [0.32-0.38]). Among gun-owning households with children, approximately two in ten gun owners store at least one gun in the least safe manner, i.e., loaded and unlocked (0.21 [0.17-0.26]); three in ten store all guns in the safest manner, i.e., unloaded and locked (0.29, [0.24-0.34]; and the remaining half (0.50 [0.45-0.55]) store firearms in some other way. Although firearm storage practices do not appear to vary across some demographic characteristics, including age, sex, and race, gun owners are more likely to store at least one gun loaded and unlocked if they are female (0.31 [0.23-0.41]) vs. male (0.17 [0.13-0.22]); own at least one handgun (0.27 [0.22-0.32] vs. no handguns (0.05 [0.02-0.15]); or own firearms for protection (0.29 [0.24-0.35]) vs. do not own for protection (0.03 [0.01-0.08]). Approximately 7% of US children (4.6 million) live in homes in which at least one firearm is stored loaded and unlocked, an estimate that is more than twice as high as estimates reported in 2002, the last time a nationally representative survey assessed this outcome. To the extent that the high prevalence of children exposed to unsafe storage that we observe reflects a secular change in public opinion towards the belief that having a gun in the home makes the home safer, rather than less safe, interventions that aim to make homes safer for children should address this misconception. Guidance alone, such as that offered by the American Academy of Pediatrics, has fallen short. Our findings underscore the need for more active and creative efforts to reduce children's exposure to unsafely stored firearms.","['Children', 'Firearms', 'Guns', 'Storage', 'Suicide']"
"Current data on the background burden to the persistent organochlorine pollutants HCB, p,p'-DDE as well as PCB 138, PCB 153 and PCB 180 in plasma of the general population in Germany.","Despite their long-term ban, persistent organochlorine compounds like hexachlorobenzene (HCB), p,p'-dichlorodiphenylethylene (DDE) as well as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are still of environmental concern. For the evaluation of potential occupational or environmental exposures to these substances, it is essential to know the current background burden of the general population. As representative and up-to-date information is missing for Germany, we have analysed a large dataset generated in studies on potential exposure to lower chlorinated PCBs to fill this gap for the levels of HCB, DDE as well as PCB 138, PCB 153 and PCB 180. We have investigated n=2750 plasma samples of persons of the general population living in North Rhine-Westfalia and Hesse aged 6-65 years and sampled between September 2010 and March 2014. For evaluation of the age-dependent accumulation in the general population we have generated seven age groups in the collective. Our laboratory used a validated and quality controlled procedure using GC/MS for quantification of the organochlorine compounds in plasma (LOQ: 0.01μg/L). The median (95th percentile) levels for ∑ PCB 138+PCB 153+PCB 180 were 0.14 (0.73); 0.30 (0.82); 0.38 (0.88); 0.50 (1.14); 0.92; 1.58 (3.54) and 2.41 (4.82)μg/L plasma in the age groups 6-10 years (n=102), 11-17 years (n=499), 18-25 years (n=157), 26-35 years (n=710), 36-45 years (n=400), 46-55 years (n=525) and 56-65 years (n=357), respectively. Similarly, the median (95th percentile) levels of p,p'-DDE were 0.18 (1.24); 0.18 (0.74); 0.24 (0.85); 0.30 (1.20); 0.45 (1.74); 0.64 (3.25) and 0.94 (4.7)μg/L plasma. Finally, the median (95th percentile) of HCB in plasma in these age groups was 0.05 (0.10); 0.06 (0.11); 0.08 (0.15); 0.08 (0.15); 0.11 (0.22); 0.14 (0.42) and 0.20 (0.68)μg/L plasma. Our results prove an overall substantial reduction in the body burden to organochlorine compounds in Germany compared to earlier studies. However, 15% and 3.6% of the examined collective exceeded the HBM-I- and HBM-II-values for PCBs established by the German Human Biomonitoring Commission. Due to a large sample size and a collection period from 2010 to 2014, our data might be suitable for the evaluation of additional exposures to these POPs and may serve as reference values.","['Age distribution', 'Biological monitoring', 'General population', 'POPs']"
Efficiency and safety of optic canal unroofing in tuberculum sellae meningiomas: a meta-analysis and systematic review.,"Optic canal unroofing (OCU) has gradually become a routine technique for tuberculum sellae meningiomas (TSMs) resection. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OCU. A systematic review and meta-analysis of the published literature on this topic from 2003 to 2023 were conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. Rigorous statistical analysis with a p-value was performed for related change in visual improvement, gross total resection (GTR), visual deterioration, and olfactory nerve damage. The study included 15 articles with 384 patients in whom OCU was performed by the transcranial approach (TCA) or the endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA). Of these, 341 patients had preoperative visual loss, and 266 patients had postoperative visual recovery. The overall rate of visual improvement was 0.803 (95% CI: 0.733-0.874, p < 0.01). The rate of visual improvement in the EEA and TCA groups was 0.884 (95% CI: 0.803-0.965, p < 0.01) and 0.788 (95% CI: 0.700-0.875, p < 0.01). Further analysis of classification shows that the rate of visual improvement in Type I: < 2 cm was 0.889(95% CI: 0.739-0.969), Type II:2-4 cm was 0.844(95% CI: 0.755-0.910), Type III: > 4 cm was 0.500(95% CI: 0.068-0.932) and the total was 0.853(95% CI: 0.779-0.927 p < 0.01) with low heterogeneity of I<sup>2</sup> = 20.80%.Twelve studies separately reported GTR with OCU was 293; the rate of GTR was 0.911 (95% CI: 0.848-0.961, p < 0.01). And the rate of GTR in Type I: < 2 cm was 0.933(95% CI: 0.817-0.986), Type II:2-4 cm was 0.880(95% CI: 0.800-0.936), Type III: > 4 cm was 0.600(95% CI: 0.147-0.947). The total was 0.897(95% CI: 0.830-0.965 p < 0.01) with low heterogeneity of I<sup>2</sup> = 34.57%. The related complications of OCU were visual deterioration and olfactory nerve damage. Visual decline was reported in nine studies, and the rate was 0.077 (95% CI: 0.041-0.113, p < 0.01). Six studies reported olfactory nerve damage, and the overall rate was 0.054 (95% CI: 0.019-0.090, p < 0.01). OCU could significantly recover preoperative impaired vision and make GTR easier to achieve, which was also a safe and effective technique in TSM.","['Complications', 'Gross total resection', 'Metaanalysis', 'Optic canal unroofing', 'Tuberculum sellae meningioma', 'Visual improvement']"
The Effect of Probiotic Supplementation on Glucolipid Metabolism in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a persistent metabolic condition with an unknown pathophysiology. Moreover, T2DM remains a serious health risk despite advances in medication and preventive care. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have provided evidence that probiotics may have positive effects on glucolipid metabolism. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis of RCTs to measure the effect of probiotic therapy on glucolipid metabolism in patients with T2DM.With no constraints on the language used in the literature, Excerpta Medica Database, PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and the Web of Science were searched for pertinent RCTs published between the date of creation and 18 August 2022. Stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied by two reviewers to independently examine the literature. The risk of bias associated with the inclusion of the original studies was assessed using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, and Stata 15.0 was used to perform the meta-analysis.Thirty-seven publications containing a total of 2502 research participants were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that after a probiotic intervention, the experimental group showed a significant decrease in body mass index (standardised mean difference (SMD) = -0.42, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-0.76, -0.08]), fasting glucose concentration (SMD = -0.73, 95% CI [-0.97, -0.48]), fasting insulin concentration (SMD = -0.67, 95% CI [-0.99, -0.36]), glycated haemoglobin concentration (SMD = -0.55, 95% CI [-0.75, -0.35]), Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance score (SMD = -0.88, 95% CI [-1.17, -0.59]), triglyceride concentration (SMD = -0.30, 95% CI [-0.43, -0.17]), total cholesterol concentration (SMD = -0.27, 95% CI [-0.43, -0.11]), and low-density lipoprotein concentration (SMD = -0.20, 95% CI [-0.37, -0.04]), and an increase in high-density lipoprotein concentration (SMD = 0.31, 95% CI [0.08, 0.54]). Moreover, subgroup analyses showed that patients with a longer intervention time, or those who were treated with multiple strains of probiotics, may benefit more than those with a shorter intervention time or those who were treated with a single probiotic strain, respectively.Probiotic supplementation improves glucolipid metabolism in patients with T2DM, offering an alternative approach for the treatment of these patients.","['glucolipid metabolism', 'probiotics', 'randomised controlled trial', 'type 2 diabetes mellitus']"
"Characterising tibialis posterior tendinopathy using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health: a cross sectional study.","Tibialis posterior tendinopathy (TPT) is characterised by pain around the medial foot/ankle and difficulties weightbearing.Compare individuals who have TPT with asymptomatic controls across the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) domains of body structure and function, activity, participation and personal factors.Twenty-two individuals meeting the selection criteria for TPT (86% female, mean ± SD age:43 ± 13 years; body mass index [BMI]:28 ± 7 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were compared to 27 controls (93% female, age:44 ± 16 years, BMI:23 ± 5 kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Standardised differences (and 95% confidence intervals [CIs]) between groups were estimated for outcomes under each ICF domain using Cliff's delta to allow for comparison of the magnitude of deficits across outcomes (>0.47 considered large).Impairments in body structure and function in individuals with TPT were accompanied by activity limitations including difficulties due to foot problems (-1.0 (-1.0, -1.0)) and with independent living (-0.8 (-1.0, -0.3)) and greater time to complete stair descent/ascent (-0.6 (-0.8, -0.3)). Considering participation, overall foot-related function (-1.0 (-1.0, -1.0)), ability to participate in activities (-0.7 (-0.08, -0.3)), social restrictions (-0.8 (-1.0, -0.4)) and quality of life (-0.7 (-0.9, -0.5)) were poorer in individuals with TPT.Individuals with TPT have large impairments in body structure and function, activity limitations and participation restrictions, particularly relating to independent living, mental health and pain. Personal factors appear to contribute to a lesser extent to the TPT presentation. Treatment plans should consider activity and participation limitations in addition to body structure and function.","['Disability', 'Musculoskeletal', 'Pain', 'Quality of life', 'Tendon']"
Integration of Machine Learning Algorithms and Discrete-Event Simulation for the Cost of Healthcare Resources.,"A healthcare resource allocation generally plays a vital role in the number of patients treated (<i>p<sub>nt</sub></i>) and the patient waiting time (<i>w<sub>t</sub></i>) in healthcare institutions. This study aimed to estimate <i>p<sub>nt</sub></i> and <i>w<sub>t</sub></i> as output variables by considering the number of healthcare resources employed and analyze the cost of health resources to the hospital depending on the cost coefficient (<i>δ</i><sub>i</sub>) in an emergency department (ED). The integration of the discrete-event simulation (DES) model and machine learning (ML) algorithms, namely random forest (RF), gradient boosting (GB), and AdaBoost (AB), was used to calculate the estimation of the output variables depending on the <i>δ</i><sub>i</sub> of resources cost. The AB algorithm performed best in almost all scenarios based on the results of the analysis. According to the AB algorithm based on the <i>δ</i><sub>0.0</sub>, <i>δ</i><sub>0.1</sub>, <i>δ</i><sub>0.2</sub>, and <i>δ</i><sub>0.3</sub>, the accuracy data were calculated as 0.9838, 0.9843, 0.9838, and 0.9846 for <i>p<sub>nt</sub></i>; 0.9514, 0.9517, 0.9514, and 0.9514 for <i>w<sub>t</sub></i>, respectively in the training stage. The GB algorithm had the best performance value, except for the results of the <i>δ</i><sub>0.2</sub> (AB had a better accuracy at 0.8709 based on the value of <i>δ</i><sub>0.2</sub> for <i>p<sub>nt</sub></i>) in the test stage. According to the AB algorithm based on the <i>δ</i><sub>0.0</sub>, <i>δ</i><sub>0.1</sub>, <i>δ</i><sub>0.2</sub>, and <i>δ</i><sub>0.3</sub>, the accuracy data were calculated as 0.7956, 0.9298, 0.8288, and 0.7394 for <i>p<sub>nt</sub></i>; 0.8820, 0.8821, 0.8819, and 0.8818 for <i>w<sub>t</sub></i> in the training phase, respectively. All scenarios created by the <i>δ</i><sub>i</sub> coefficient should be preferred for ED since the income provided by the <i>p<sub>nt</sub></i> value to the hospital was more than the cost of healthcare resources. On the contrary, the <i>w<sub>t</sub></i> estimation results of ML algorithms based on the <i>δ</i><sub>i</sub> coefficient differed. Although <i>w<sub>t</sub></i> values in all ML algorithms with <i>δ</i><sub>0.0</sub> and <i>δ</i><sub>0.1</sub> coefficients reduced the cost of the hospital, <i>w<sub>t</sub></i> values based on <i>δ</i><sub>0.2</sub> and <i>δ</i><sub>0.3</sub> increased the cost of the hospital.","['cost analysis', 'discreteevent simulation', 'healthcare resources', 'machine learning', 'pnt and wt']"
"Correlation between change in central subfield thickness and change in visual acuity in macular edema due to retinal vein occlusion: post hoc analysis of COPERNICUS, GALILEO, and VIBRANT.","Assess correlation between change in central subfield thickness (CST) and change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in eyes with macular edema due to retinal vein occlusion (RVO) that received intravitreal aflibercept injections (IAI).Post hoc analysis of COPERNICUS and GALILEO trials for CRVO and VIBRANT trial for BRVO with relationships determined using Pearson correlation coefficient.In COPERNICUS, correlations (r) between change in CST and change in BCVA from baseline at weeks 12, 24, 52, and 100 were -0.36 (95% CI: -0.52, -0.18; P < 0.001), -0.38 (95% CI: -0.53, -0.20; P < 0.001), -0.44 (95% CI: -0.58, -0.27; P < 0.001), and -0.41 (95% CI: -0.56, -0.23; P < 0.001), respectively. CST changes accounted for only 21% of the variance in BCVA changes; every 100-µm decrease in CST was associated with a 2.1-letter increase in BCVA (P = 0.003). Similar findings were noted for GALILEO (r, -0.45 to -0.23) and VIBRANT (r, -0.36 to -0.32) trials.In eyes treated with IAI for macular edema due to RVO, correlation between change in CST and change in BCVA was weak to moderate. While change in CST may be helpful in determining the need for anti-VEGF therapy, these findings do not support using changes in CST as a surrogate for changes in visual acuity outcomes.","['Central subfield thickness', 'Macular edema', 'Retinal vein occlusion', 'Visual acuity']"
Efficacy and Safety of Ayurveda interventions in the management of conjunctivitis: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Conjunctivitis is the inflammation of the conjunctiva. Although data on clinical efficacy and safety of various ayurvedic treatments in conjunctivitis is published, systematic review is not done. This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ayurvedic treatments in conjunctivitis.A literature search of the Cochrane Library (Cochrane central register of controlled trials: issue 6 of 12, June 2018), Pub Med, AYUSH research portal (Govt. of India), DHARA portal, Google scholar and online clinical trials registers was done. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomized controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled clinical trials (CCTs) and multiple arms clinical trials were identified in which Ayurveda treatments with any dose, type, schedule, drug, dosage form, and advised Pathayapathya (lifestyle changes) were selected.We identified 13 eligible RCTs, five CCTs and two multiple arms clinical trials which includes a total of 816 participants. Meta analysis of data from five trials showed that ayurvedic treatments benefitted more compared with non-ayurveda interventions in symptoms like itching (SMD = -0.98, 95% CI (-1.30,-0.65) p < 0.00001, I<sup>2</sup> = 38%), pain (SMD = -0.57, 95% CI (-0.87, -0.29, P = 0.0001, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%), ropy discharge (SMD = -1.02, 95% CI(-1.45, -0.59), P < 0.00001, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%), conjunctival congestion (SMD = -0.67, 95% CI (-0.91, -0.43), p < 0.00001, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%), foreign body sensation (SMD = -0.68, 95% CI(-1.06, -0.29), p = 0.0006, I<sup>2</sup> = 46%, Fig. 8) and lid heaviness (SMD = -0.66, 95% CI(- 0.98, -0.33), p < 0.0001, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%).Although some findings confirm the benefit of ayurveda as opposed to non ayurveda for the treatment of conjunctivitis, since the studies have high risk of bias and are of lower quality, the findings could not be generalized.

The Effect of the Paleolithic Diet vs. Healthy Diets on Glucose and Insulin Homeostasis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Recently, the Paleolithic diet became popular due to its possible health benefits. Several, albeit not all, studies suggested that the consumption of the Paleolithic diet might improve glucose tolerance, decrease insulin secretion, and increase insulin sensitivity. Therefore, the aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the effect of the Paleolithic diet with other types of diets on glucose and insulin homeostasis in subjects with altered glucose metabolism. Four databases (PubMed, Web of Sciences, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library) were searched to select studies in which the effects of the Paleolithic diet on fasting glucose and insulin levels, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and area under the curve (AUC 0-120) for glucose and insulin during the oral glucose tolerance test were assessed. In total, four studies with 98 subjects which compared the effect of the Paleolithic diet with other types of diets (the Mediterranean diet, diabetes diet, and a diet recommended by the Dutch Health Council) were included in this meta-analysis. The Paleolithic diet did not differ from other types of diets with regard to its effect on fasting glucose (standardized mean difference (SMD): -0.343, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.867, 0.181, <i>p</i> = 0.200) and insulin (SMD: -0.141; 95% CI: -0.599, 0.318; <i>p</i> = 0.548) levels. In addition, there were no differences between the Paleolithic diet and other types of diets in HOMA-IR (SMD: -0.151; 95% CI: -0.610, 0.309; <i>p</i> = 0.521), HbA1c (SMD: -0.380; 95% CI: -0.870, 0.110; <i>p</i> = 0.129), AUC 0-120 glucose (SMD: -0.558; 95% CI: -1.380, 0.264; <i>p</i> = 0.183), and AUC 0-120 insulin (SMD: -0.068; 95% CI: -0.526, 0.390; <i>p</i> = 0.772). In conclusion, the Paleolithic diet did not differ from other types of diets commonly perceived as healthy with regard to effects on glucose and insulin homeostasis in subjects with altered glucose metabolism.","['Paleolithic diet', 'glucose', 'glucose metabolism disorders', 'glycated hemoglobin', 'insulin']"
Performance Changes Following Heat Acclimation and the Factors That Influence These Changes: Meta-Analysis and Meta-Regression.,"Heat acclimation (HA) is the process of intentional and consistent exercise in the heat that results in positive physiological adaptations, which can improve exercise performance both in the heat and thermoneutral conditions. Previous research has indicated the many performance benefits of HA, however, a meta-analysis examining the magnitude of different types of performance improvement is absent. Additionally, there are several methodological discrepancies in the literature that could lead to increased variability in performance improvement following HA and no previous study has examined the impact of moderators on performance improvement following HA. Therefore, the aim of this study was two-fold; (1) to perform a meta-analysis to examine the magnitude of changes in performance following HA in maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2max</sub>), time to exhaustion, time trial, mean power, and peak power tests; (2) to determine the impact of moderators on results of these performance tests. Thirty-five studies met the inclusion/exclusion criteria with 23 studies that assessed VO<sub>2max</sub> (<i>n</i> = 204), 24 studies that assessed time to exhaustion (<i>n</i> = 232), 10 studies that performed time trials (<i>n</i> = 101), 7 studies that assessed mean power (<i>n</i> = 67), and 10 papers that assessed peak power (<i>n</i> = 88). Data are reported as Hedge's g effect size (ES), and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Statistical significance was set to <i>p</i> < 0.05, a priori. The magnitude of change following HA was analyzed, with time to exhaustion demonstrating the largest performance enhancement (ES [95% CI], 0.86 [0.71, 1.01]), followed by time trial (0.49 [0.26, 0.71]), mean power (0.37 [0.05, 0.68]), VO<sub>2max</sub> (0.30 [0.07, 0.53]), and peak power (0.29 [0.09, 0.48]) (<i>p</i> < 0.05). When all of the covariates were analyzed as individual models, induction method, fitness level, heat index in time to exhaustion (coefficient [95% CI]; induction method, -0.69 [-1.01, -0.37], <i>p</i> < 0.001; fitness level, 0.04 [0.02, 0.06], <i>p</i> < 0.001; heat index, 0.04 [0.02, 0.07], <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and induction length in mean power (coefficient [95% CI]; induction length 0.15 [0.05, 0.25], <i>p</i> = 0.002) significantly impacted the magnitude of change. Sport scientists and researchers can use the findings from this meta-analysis to customize HA induction. For time to exhaustion improvements, HA implementation should focus on induction method and baseline fitness, while the training and recovery balance could lead to optimal time trial performance.","['adaptation', 'athlete', 'capacity', 'thermoregulation', 'training']"
"The correlations of anti-mullerian hormone, follicle-stimulating hormone and antral follicle count in different age groups of infertile women.","The objective of our study was to identify the correlations between the tests currently used in ovarian reserve assessment: anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and antral follicle count (AFC) and to distinguish the most reliable markers for ovarian reserve in order to select an adequate strategy for the initial stages of infertility treatment.In this prospective study, 112 infertile women were assessed. Subjects were divided into three age groups: group I <35 years (n=39), group II 35-40 years (n=31), and group III 41-46 years (n=42). AMH, FSH and AFC were determined on days 2-3 of the patients' menstrual cycles.There was a significantly elevated negative correlation between age and AMH level (rs=-0.67, p<0.0001) and AFC (rs=-0.55, p<0.0001). We observed a significantly positive correlation between age and FSH (rs=0.38, p<0.0001). AMH negatively correlated with FSH (rs=-0.48, p<0.0001) and positively with AFC (r=-0.71, p=0.0001). There was a moderate negative relation between FSH and AFC (r=-0.41, p=0.0001) and moderate positive relation between age and FSH (rs=0.38, p<0.0001). The correlation analysis performed in separate groups showed that AMH and AFC showed a statistically significant positive correlation for group I (r=0.57, p<0.0001), group II (r=0.69, p<0.0001) and group III (r=0.47, p<0.002). A statistically significant correlation between FSH and AMH was detected only in groups I (r=-0.41, p<0.02) and II (r=-0.55, p<0.0001). A statistically significant correlation existed between FSH and AFC only in group III (r=-0.42, p<0.006), as well as between age and AFC only in group I (r=-0.35, p<0.03).Currently, AMH should be considered as the more reliable of the ovarian reserve assessments tests compared to FSH. There is a strong positive correlation between serum AMH level and AFC. The use of AMH combined with AFC may improve ovarian reserve evaluation.","['AntiMullerian Hormone', 'Follicle Stimulating Hormone', 'Mullerian Inhibiting Substance']"
Genetic relationships of carcass traits with retail cut productivity of hanwoo cattle.,"This study aimed to estimate genetic correlation between carcass grading and retail productivity traits and to estimate the correlated response on retail productivity traits through selection for carcass grading traits in order to assess the efficacy of indirect selection. Genetic parameters were estimated with the data from 4240 Hanwoo steers using mixed models, and phenotypes included carcass weight (CWT), back fat thickness (BFT), eye muscle area (EMA), marbling (MAR), and estimated lean yield percentage (ELP) as the carcass grading traits, and weight and portion of retail cuts (RCW and RCP), trimmed fats (TFW and TFP) and trimmed bones (TBW and TBP) as the lean productivity traits. The CWT had positive genetic correlations with RCW (0.95) and TFW (0.73), but its genetic correlation with RCP was negligible (0.02). The BFT was negatively correlated with RCP (-0.63), but positively correlated with TFW and TFP (0.77 and 0.70). Genetic correlations of MAR with TFW and TFP were low. Among the carcass grading traits, only EMA was positively correlated with both RCW (0.60) and RCP (0.72). The EMA had a relatively strong negative genetic correlation with TFW (-0.64). The genetic correlation coefficients of ELP with RCP, TFW, and TFP were 0.76, -0.90, and -0.82, respectively. These correlation coefficients suggested that the ELP and EMA might be favorable traits in regulating lean productivity of carcass.","['Correlated Response', 'Genetic Parameters', 'Indirect Selection', 'Mixed Model']"
"Mental health associations with eczema, asthma and hay fever in children: a cross-sectional survey.","This study aimed to examine the association of eczema, asthma and hay fever with mental health in a general child population and to assess the influence of parental socioeconomic position on these associations.We conducted a cross-sectional health survey of children aged 3, 6, 11 and 15 years in the City of Copenhagen, Denmark. Individual questionnaire data on eczema, asthma, and hay fever and mental health problems assessed using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) was linked to register data on demographics and parental socioeconomic position. 9215 (47.9%) children were included in the analyses.Linear regression analyses showed that children with current eczema symptoms had higher SDQ scores (mean difference, 95% CI) of emotional problems (0.26, 0.12 to 0.39), conduct problems (0.19, 0.09 to 0.29) and hyperactivity problems (0.32, 0.16 to 0.48); children with current asthma symptoms had higher SDQ scores of emotional problems (0.45, 0.32 to 0.58), conduct problems (0.28, 0.18 to 0.38) and hyperactivity problems (0.52, 0.35 to 0.69); and children with current hay fever symptoms had higher SDQ scores of emotional problems (0.57, 0.42 to 0.72), conduct problems (0.22, 0.11 to 0.33), hyperactivity problems (0.44, 0.26 to 0.61) and peer problems (0.14, 0.01 to 0.26), compared with children without current symptoms of the relevant disease. For most associations, parental socioeconomic position did not modify the effect.Children with eczema, asthma or hay fever had more emotional, conduct and hyperactivity problems, but not peer problems, compared with children without these diseases. Atopic diseases added equally to the burden of mental health problems independent of socioeconomic position.",['MENTAL HEALTH']
"Association between APE1 Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (rs1760944) and Cancer Risk: a Meta-Analysis Based on 6,419 Cancer Cases and 6,781 Case-free Controls.","Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) is an essential enzyme in the base excision repair pathway. Epidemiological studies have suggested associations between APE1 rs1760944 polymorphism and cancer risk. This study was aimed to evaluate the relationship between APE1 rs1760944 polymorphism and cancer risk. We searched Pubmed, ISI Web of Knowledge, Embase, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases until September 2013 to identify eligible studies. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were used to estimate the strength of the associations. 12 studies from 11 articles on APE1 rs1760944 genotypes and cancer risk were identified, including a total of 6,419 cancer cases and 6,781 case-free controls. Overall, APE1 rs1760944 polymorphism was significantly associated with the decreased risk of cancer in any genetic models (G vs. T: OR = 0.86, 95% CI = 0.82-0.90; homozygote comparison: OR = 0.74, 95% CI = 0.67-0.82; heterozygote comparison: OR =0.88, 95%CI = 0.81-0.95; dominant model TG+GG vs. TT: OR = 0.82, 95% CI = 0.76-0.89; recessive model GG vs. TT+TG: OR = 0.81, 95%CI = 0.75-0.88). In the stratified analysis by populations, the effect was remain in studies of Asian population (homozygote comparison: OR = 0.71, 95%CI = 0.63-0.79; heterozygote comparison: OR = 0.86, 95 %CI = 0.79- 0.94; dominant model: OR = 0.80, 95% CI = 0.74 -0.87 and recessive model: OR = 0.78, 95%CI = 0.71-0.86). Moreover, a significantly decreased risk was found in lung cancer studies (homozygote comparison: OR = 0.68, 95% CI = 0.59-0.79; heterozygote comparison: OR = 0.86, 95%CI = 0.77- 0.98; dominant model: OR = 0.80, 95%CI = 0.72-0.90 and recessive model: OR= 0.77, 95% CI= 0.68-0.87). These findings support that APE1 rs1760944 polymorphism has a possible protective effect on cancer susceptibility particularly among Asians. Further studies based on different ethnicity and various cancer types are warranted to verify our findings.","['APE1', 'cancer susceptibility', 'metaanalysis', 'single nucleotide polymorphism']"
Randomized Trial of Soft Contact Lenses with Novel Ring Focus for Controlling Myopia Progression.,"To evaluate efficacy and vision with 2 prototype myopia control soft contact lenses with noncoaxial ring-focus designs (for enhancing efficacy [EE] and enhancing vision [EV]) compared with dual-focus (DF) and single-vision (SV) designs.Multicenter, 6-month, randomized, controlled, double-masked clinical trial.One hundred ninety-nine myopic (-0.75 diopters [D] to -4.50 D) children aged 7 to 12 years.Participants were randomized with stratification into myopia control (EE, EV, or DF) or SV arms at 9 clinical sites in 3 countries. Postcycloplegia axial length (AL) and spherical equivalent autorefraction (SECAR) were measured at baseline and 26 weeks. Axial length was also measured without cycloplegia at baseline, 1, 4, 13, and 26 weeks. Progression was analyzed using linear mixed models by intention-to-treat population. Visual acuity (VA) and vision quality were monitored.Axial elongation, change in SECAR.A total of 185 subjects completed the study (n = 44, 49, 45, and 47 for EE, EV, DF, and SV, respectively). There were no serious/significant ocular adverse events. After 26 weeks, EE, EV, and DF all had statistically significantly less axial elongation than SV (unadjusted mean [standard deviation]: EE, 0.079 [0.125]; EV, 0.119 [0.101]; DF, 0.135 [0.117]; SV; 0.189 [0.121] mm). The estimated least-square mean (LSM) differences (adjusted 95% confidence interval) compared with SV were -0.105 (-0.149, -0.062), -0.063 (-0.106, -0.020), and -0.056 (-0.100, -0.013) mm for EE, EV, and DF, respectively. Enhancing efficacy alone had statistically significantly less progression of SECAR than SV (EE: -0.12 [0.27] D vs. SV: -0.35 [0.33] D; LSM difference: 0.22 D [0.09, 0.35]). Enhancing efficacy also had statistically significantly less axial elongation than DF (-0.049 mm [-0.093, -0.004]). Changes in AL and SECAR of EV and DF were not statistically different. All 3 myopia control lenses had mean VA close to 0.00 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) with estimated 95% upper confidence limits <0.10 logMAR. Enhancing efficacy and DF produced similar reports of halos but more than EV and SV.The prototype contact lenses met the design intent; EE was more efficacious in slowing axial elongation than DF with comparable vision performance, whereas EV produced comparable efficacy to DF with similar vision performance to SV.","['AL', 'axial length', 'Axial length', 'Myopia control', 'Pediatric', 'Soft contact lenses', 'Vision', 'B2B', 'bottom2boxes', 'CI', 'confidence interval', 'D', 'diopter', 'DF', 'dualfocus', 'EE', 'enhanced efficacy', 'EV', 'enhanced vision', 'LSM', 'leastsquare mean', 'MMRM', 'mixed models with repeated measures', 'SD', 'standard deviation', 'SE', 'standard error', 'SECAR', 'spherical equivalent cycloplegic autorefraction', 'SV', 'singlevision', 'VA', 'visual acuity', 'logMAR', 'logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution']"
"Associations of Thyroid Hormones Profile During Normal Pregnancy and Postpartum With Anxiety, Depression, and Obsessive/Compulsive Disorder Scores in Euthyroid Women.","Thyroid dysfunction (overt and subclinical) has been consistently linked to pregnancy adversity and abnormal fetal growth and development. Mood disorders such as anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) are frequently diagnosed during pregnancy and at postpartum, and emerging evidence suggests association with impaired offspring neurodevelopment and growth. This study aimed to examine potential associations between thyroid function and mood symptoms during pregnancy and postpartum.This is a prospective study measuring thyroid hormones and assessing mood symptoms by employing specific questionnaires in the same cohort of 93 healthy pregnant women at the 24th (2nd trimester) and 36th (3rd trimester) gestational weeks and at the 1st postpartum week.Serum thyroid hormones, TSH, anti-TPO, and anti-Tg antibodies were measured at the 24th (2nd trimester) and 36th (3rd trimester) gestational weeks and at the 1st postpartum week. Specific validated questionnaires were employed at the same time-points to assess separately symptoms of anxiety [Generalized Anxiety Disorder Inventory (GADI), Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ), STAI-State Anxiety inventory (STAI-S), STAI-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T)], depression [Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), Stein's Blues Scale (BLUES), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)], and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) [Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive scale (Y-BOCS)].At the 2nd trimester, GADI score correlated negatively with FT3 (<i>p</i> < 0.010, <i>r</i> = -0.545) and positively with TSH (<i>p</i> < 0.050, <i>r</i> = 0.837) concentrations; GADI, PSWQ, EPDS and Y-BOCS scores correlated negatively with FT4 concentrations (<i>p</i> < 0.010, <i>r</i> = -0.768; <i>p</i> < 0.010, <i>r</i> = -0.384; <i>p</i> < 0.050, <i>r</i> = -0.364; <i>p</i> < 0.010, <i>r</i> = -0.544, respectively). At the 3rd trimester, BLUES score correlated positively with rT3 concentrations (<i>p</i> = 0.00, <i>r</i> = 0.89); GADI, EPDS, and Y-BOCS scores correlated negatively with FT4 concentrations (<i>p</i> = 0.001, <i>r</i> = - 0.468; <i>p</i> = 0.036, <i>r</i> = -0.39; <i>p</i> = 0.001, <i>r</i> = -0.625, respectively); GADI, STAI-S, and Y-BOCS scores correlated positively with TSH concentrations (<i>p</i> = 0.015, <i>r</i> = 0.435; <i>p</i> = 0.024, <i>r</i> = 0.409 <i>p</i> = 0.041, <i>r</i> = 0.389, respectively). At postpartum, PSWQ, STAI-T, EPDS, and BDI scores correlated positively with rT3 concentrations (<i>p</i> = 0.024, <i>r</i> = 0.478; <i>p</i> = 0.014, <i>r</i> = 0.527; <i>p</i> = 0.046, <i>r</i> = 0.44; <i>p</i> = 0.021, <i>r</i> = 0.556, respectively, Y-BOCS score correlated positively with TSH (<i>p</i> = 0.045, <i>r</i> = 0.43), and BLUES score correlated positively with anti-TPO antibody concentrations (<i>p</i> = 0.070, <i>r</i> = 0.586).The reported findings demonstrate positive associations between low-normal thyroid function at the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy and postpartum with anxiety, depression, and OCD scores.","['anxiety', 'depression', 'obsessive—compulsive disorder', 'postpartum', 'pregnancy', 'psychometrics', 'thyroid hormone']"
The efficacy and safety of Chinese herbal medicine as an add-on therapy for type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with carotid atherosclerosis: An updated meta-analysis of 27 randomized controlled trials.,"<b>Background:</b> Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a clinical metabolic syndrome characterized by persistent hyperglycemia. Patients with T2DM are more likely to have carotid atherosclerosis (CAS), which can lead to dizziness, amaurosis or even stroke. Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) has shown possible efficacy and safety in treating T2DM patients with CAS. However, the existing evidence was not robust enough and the results were out of date. <b>Objective:</b> This meta-analysis aimed to summarize the current evidence and systematically evaluate the effects of CHM on carotid plaque, glucose and lipid metabolism and vascular endothelial parameters in T2DM patients with CAS, providing a reference for subsequent research and clinical practice. <b>Methods:</b> This study was registered in PROSPERO as CRD42022346274. Both Chinese and English databases were searched from their inceptions to 16 July 2022. All retrieved studies were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) using oral CHM to treat T2DM patients with CAS were included. The literature quality was assessed using the risk of bias assessment tool in the Cochrane Handbook. Data extraction was conducted on the selected studies. Review Manager 5.4 and Stata 16.0 were used for meta-analysis. Sources of heterogeneity were explored by meta-regression or subgroup analysis. Funnel plot and Egger's test were used to assess publication bias and the evidence quality was assessed by Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). <b>Results:</b> 27 eligible studies, involving 2638 patients, were included in this study. Compared with western medicine (WM) alone, the addition of CHM was significantly better in improving carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) [mean difference (MD) = -0.11mm, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.15 to -0.07, <i>p</i> < 0.01], carotid plaque Crouse score [MD = -1.21, 95%CI: -1.35 to -1.07, <i>p</i> < 0.01], total cholesterol (TC) [MD = -0.34 mmol/L, 95%CI: -0.54 to -0.14, <i>p</i> < 0.01], triglyceride (TG) [MD = -0.26 mmol/L, 95%CI: -0.37 to -0.15, <i>p</i> < 0.01], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) [MD = -0.36 mmol/L, 95%CI: -0.47 to -0.25, <i>p</i> < 0.01], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) [MD = 0.22 mmol/L, 95%CI: 0.13 to 0.30, <i>p</i> < 0.01], glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) [MD = -0.36%, 95%CI: -0.51 to -0.21, <i>p</i> < 0.01], fasting blood glucose (FBG) [MD = -0.33 mmol/L, 95%CI: -0.50 to -0.16, <i>p</i> < 0.01], 2-h postprandial glucose (2hPG) [MD = -0.52 mmol/L, 95%CI: -0.95 to -0.09, <i>p</i> < 0.01], homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) [standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.88, 95%CI: -1.36 to -0.41, <i>p</i> < 0.01] and homeostasis model assessment of beta-cell function (HOMA-β) [MD = 0.80, 95%CI: 0.51 to 1.09, <i>p</i> < 0.01]. Due to the small number of included studies, it is unclear whether CHM has an improving effect on nitric oxide (NO), endothelin-1 (ET-1), peak systolic velocity (PSV) and resistance index (RI). No serious adverse events were observed. <b>Conclusion:</b> Based on this meta-analysis, we found that in the treatment of T2DM patients with CAS, combined with CHM may have more advantages than WM alone, which can further reduce CIMT and carotid plaque Crouse score, regulate glucose and lipid metabolism, improve insulin resistance and enhance islet β-cell function. Meanwhile, CHM is relatively safe. However, limited by the quality and heterogeneity of included studies, the efficacy and safety of CHM remain uncertain. More high-quality studies are still needed to provide more reliable evidence for the clinical application of CHM. <b>Systematic Review Registration:</b> https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier CRD42022346274.","['Chinese herbal medicine', 'Systematic review', 'carotid atherosclerosis', 'metaanalysis', 'type 2 diabetes mellitus']"
Association of urine autoantibodies with disease activity in systemic lupus erythematosus.,"The presence of urinary autoantibodies in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been confirmed by several studies; however, the significance of their presence in urine remains unclear. This study aims to further investigate the association between urine autoantibodies and disease activity as well as organ involvement in SLE.This cross-sectional study included 89 SLE patients. Data collected included anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-ENA antibodies, and anti-dsDNA antibody levels in both serum and urine, complement (C) 3, C4 levels in serum, SLE disease activity index-2000 (SLEDAI-2000), renal domains of SLEDAI (RSLEDAI) and non-renal SLEDAI (NRSLEDAI).The rate of positive urine ANA (uANA) was 33.3% (29/87) among the enrolled patients. Compared to the uANA negative group, the positive group exhibited significantly higher SLEDAI-2000 scores (7.85 ± 5.88 vs. 18.69 ± 6.93, <i>p</i> < 0.001), RSLEDAI scores [0 (0, 4.0) vs. 12.0 (8.0, 16.0), <i>p</i> < 0.001], and NRSLEDAI [4 (2.0, 8.0) vs. 6.0 (4.0, 9.5), <i>p</i> = 0.038]. Patients with positive urine anti-Sm antibody demonstrated significantly elevated SLEDAI-2000 scores compared to those who were negative (25.0 ± 8.80 vs. 10.09 ± 6.63, <i>p</i> < 0.001). Similarly, they also had higher RSLEDAI [16.0 (12.0, 16.0) vs. 4.0 (0, 8.0), <i>p</i> < 0.001] and NRSLEDAI [9.5 (6.0, 13.5) vs. 4.0 (3.0, 8.0), <i>p</i> = 0.012], as well as a greater prevalence of renal involvement compared to their negative counterparts (100% vs. 58.2, <i>p</i> = 0.022). There was a positive correlation between uANA titer and both SLEDAI-2000 (<i>r<sub>s</sub></i> = 0.663, <i>p</i> < 0.001) and RSLEDAI (<i>r<sub>s</sub></i> = 0.662, <i>p</i> < 0.001). The serum anti-dsDNA antibody level did not exhibit a significant correlation with RSLEDAI (<i>r<sub>s</sub></i> = 0.143, <i>p</i> = 0.182). Conversely, the urine anti-dsDNA antibody level demonstrated a significant positive correlation with RSLEDAI (<i>r<sub>s</sub></i> = 0.529, <i>p</i> < 0.001).Urine ANA is associated with both global SLEDAI and RSLEDAI scores. Urine anti-Sm antibody is associated with an increased incidence of renal involvement in SLE. The urine anti-dsDNA antibody level, rather than the serum anti-dsDNA antibody level, exhibits a significant association with RSLEDAI in SLE.","['SLEDAI', 'lupus nephritis', 'systemic lupus erythematosus', 'urine antidsDNA antibodies', 'urine antinuclear antibody']"
Impacts of the hearing aid intervention on healthcare utilization and costs among middle-aged and older adults: results from a randomized controlled trial in rural China.,"Hearing impairment has become a major global health issue. To reduce the burden of hearing impairment, we explored impacts of the hearing aid intervention on healthcare utilization and costs.In this randomized controlled trial, participants aged 45+ were allocated with a ratio of 1:1.5 (intervention: control). Neither the investigators nor the assessors were blinded to the allocation status. Those in the intervention group were fitted with hearing aids, and those in the control group received no care. We applied the difference-in-difference (DID) approach to examine the impacts on healthcare utilization and costs. Given that social network and age can be significant variables affecting effectiveness of the intervention, subgroup analyses by social network and age were used to explore the heterogeneity.395 subjects were successfully recruited and randomized. 10 subjects did not meet the inclusion criteria and therefore, 385 eligible subjects (150 in the treatment group and 235 in the control group) were analyzed. The intervention significantly reduced their total healthcare costs (average treatment effect (ATE) = -1.26, 95% CI = -2.39, -0.14, <i>p</i> = 0.028) and total out-of-pocket (OOP) healthcare costs (ATE = -1.29, 95% CI = -2.37, -0.20, <i>p</i> = 0.021) in the 20-month follow-up. To be exact, it reduced self-medication costs (ATE = -0.82, 95% CI = -1.49, -0.15, <i>p</i> = 0.016) and OOP self-medication costs (ATE = -0.84, 95% CI = -1.46, -0.21, <i>p</i> = 0.009). Subgroup analysis showed that the impacts on self-medication costs and OOP self-medication costs varied by social network (ATE for self-medication costs = -0.26, 95% CI = -0.50, -0.01, <i>p</i> = 0.041; ATE for OOP self-medication costs = -0.27, 95% CI = -0.52, -0.01, <i>p</i> = 0.038). The impacts also varied by age groups (ATE for self-medication costs = -0.22, 95% CI = -0.40, -0.04, <i>p</i> = 0.019; ATE for OOP self-medication costs = -0.17, 95% CI = -0.29, -0.04, <i>p</i> = 0.010). There were no adverse events or side effects during the trial.Hearing aid use significantly lowered self-medication costs and total healthcare costs, but had no impacts on inpatient or outpatient services utilization or costs. The impacts were manifested among people with active social network or younger age. It can be speculated that the intervention may be adapted to other similar settings in developing countries to reduce healthcare costs.P.H. reports grants from National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71874005) and Major Project of the National Social Science Fund of China (No. 21&ZD187).Chinese Clinical Trial Registry: ChiCTR1900024739.","['Age', 'Costs', 'Healthcare utilization', 'Hearing aids', 'Social network']"
"Red, white, and processed meat consumption related to inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers among overweight and obese women.","Considering that a high meat intake is directly associated with obesity, it is critical to address the relationship between consuming different types of meat with inflammation and metabolism in overweight and obese cohorts. Thus, we evaluated the association between red, white, and processed meat consumption with inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers in overweight and obese women.The current cross-sectional study was conducted on 391 overweight and obese Iranian women. Dietary intake was obtained from a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) with 147 items. The anthropometric measurements, serum lipid profile, and inflammatory markers were measured by standard protocols. All associations were assessed utilizing one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and linear regression models.In the adjusted model, it was established that higher intake of processed meat had a significant positive association with leptin levels (β: 0.900, 95% CI: 0.031;1.233, <i>p</i> = 0.015). Moreover, after considering the confounders, a significant positive association between processed meat and macrophage inflammatory protein (MCP-1) levels was observed (β: 0.304, 95% CI:0.100;1.596, <i>p</i> = 0.025). Positive significant associations between high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (β:0.020, 95% CI:0.000;0.050, <i>P</i> = 0.014) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) (β:0.263, 95% CI:0.112;0.345, <i>p</i> = 0.053) and MCP-1 (β:0.490, 95% CI: 0.175;1.464, <i>p</i> = 0.071) levels with red meat were also shown; while there was a significant negative association between red meat and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (β: -0.016, 95% CI: -0.022, -0.001, <i>p</i> = 0.033). Furthermore, a significant negative association were established following confounding adjustment between Galectin-3 (Gal-3) (β: -0.110, 95% CI: -0.271;0.000, <i>p</i> = 0.044), MCP-1 (β: -1.933, 95% CI: -3.721;0.192, <i>p</i> = 0.022) and Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) (β: -0.011, 95% CI: -0.020,0.000, <i>p</i> = 0.070) levels with high adherence of white meat intake. In contrast, a significant marginally positive association between PAI-1 levels and high adherence to white meat intake (β: -0.340, 95% CI: -0.751;0.050, <i>p</i> = 0.070) has been shown.Higher red and processed meat consumption were positively associated with inflammatory and metabolic markers in overweight and obese women. In contrast, negative relationships between high adherence to white meat and various inflammatory and metabolic parameters were established. Further studies are needed to confirm the causality of these associations and potential mediating pathways.","['inflammatory markers', 'obesity', 'processed meat', 'red meat', 'white meat', 'women']"
Risedronate use to attenuate bone loss following sleeve gastrectomy: Results from a pilot randomized controlled trial.,"The purpose of this study was to explore the efficacy of 150 mg once monthly oral risedronate use in the prevention of sleeve gastrectomy (SG) associated bone loss. Twenty-four SG patients (56 ± 7 years, 83% female, 21% black) were randomized to risedronate or placebo for 6 months, with an optional 12-month assessment. Outcome measures included 6 (n = 21) and 12 (n = 14) month change in dual energy x-ray absorptiometry-acquired regional areal bone mineral density (aBMD). Six-month treatment effect estimates [mean (95% CI)] revealed significant between group aBMD differences at the femoral neck [risedronate: +0.013 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (-0.021, 0.046) vs. placebo: -0.041 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (-0.067, -0.015)] and lumbar spine [risedronate: +0.028 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (-0.006, 0.063) vs. placebo: -0.029 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (-0.054, -0.004)]; both p ≤ 0.02. When followed postoperatively to 12 months, differential aBMD treatment effects were observed at the total hip [risedronate: -0.035 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (-0.061, -0.009) vs. placebo: -0.072 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (-0.091, -0.052)] and lumbar spine [risedronate: +0.012 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (-0.038, 0.063) vs. placebo: -0.052 g/cm<sup>2</sup> (-0.087, -0.017)]; both p < 0.05. Preliminary treatment effect estimates signal 6 months of risedronate use may be efficacious in reducing aBMD loss at the axial skeleton post-SG, with benefit largely maintained throughout the 1-year postoperative period. Confirmatory data from an adequately powered trial are needed.","['antiresorptive', 'bariatric surgery', 'bone', 'clinical trials', 'dualenergy xray absorptiometry', 'fracture prevention', 'weight loss']"
"Visual Acuity in Retinal Vein Occlusion, Diabetic, and Uveitic Macular Edema: Central Subfield Thickness and Ellipsoid Zone Analysis.","This study assessed relationships between best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central subfield thickness (CST), and ellipsoid zone (EZ) integrity in macular edema (ME) patients.Post hoc analysis of 6 clinical trials, which included verified diagnoses, protocol refractions, and reading center assessment of OCT images.Participants (n = 1063) were diagnosed with ME from retinal vein occlusion (RVO), diabetic retinopathy (DR; diabetic macular edema, DME), or noninfectious uveitis (NIU).For CST, 2 clinical trials for each disorder were analyzed. For EZ, 3 studies across 2 disorders were analyzed.Primary outcomes were correlations between BCVA and CST, and between BCVA and 4 central subfield EZ grades.For baseline BCVA and CST, Pearson correlation coefficients were: ME from RVO, -0.56 (774 eyes; 95% confidence interval [CI], -0.61 to -0.51; P < 0.001); DME, -0.50 (91 eyes; 95% CI, -0.64 to -0.33; P < 0.001); and ME from NIU, -0.38 (198 eyes; 95% CI, -0.49 to -0.26; P < 0.001). Regarding change from baseline to 24 weeks for both BCVA and CST, Pearson correlation coefficients were: ME from RVO, -0.35 (95% CI, -0.43 to -0.27; P < 0.001); DME, -0.30 (95% CI, -0.48 to -0.09; P = 0.006); and ME from NIU, -0.42 (95% CI, -0.53 to -0.29; P < 0.001). Acute and chronic ME showed similar baseline and 24-week change linear correlations. With lower baseline CST, a trend of decreased baseline and 24-week change correlations was found. For central subfield EZ at baseline, mean BCVA progressively worsened with each of 4 EZ grades in 185 eyes with gradable EZ (DME, 41 eyes; NIU, 144 eyes; P ≤ 0.050 for all pairwise comparisons except between normal and questionably abnormal EZ grades). Eyes with normal baseline central subfield EZ showed greater 24-week change in BCVA than those with abnormal baseline EZ (15.00 letters vs. 8.16 letters; P = 0.0005, with baseline BCVA, CST, and age as covariates).Despite these correlations, CST and EZ integrity, as graded herein, account for the minority of BCVA variation in patients with ME resulting from RVO, DR, and NIU.","['Central subfield thickness', 'Ellipsoid zone', 'Macular edema', 'Photoreceptor inner segment–outer segment junction', 'Visual acuity']"
The association of tea consumption and the risk and progression of prostate cancer: a meta-analysis.,"Many studies have focused on the association of tea consumption and the risk and progression of prostate cancer (PCa). However, the evidence is inadequate to draw robust conclusions. To shed light on these inconclusive findings, we conducted a meta-analysis. We searched the database of PubMed and Web of Science for eligible articles. The relevant data were abstracted by two independent reviewers and performed with Stata 11.0. 21 studies were included. The pooled outcomes showed that there was a significant association between tea consumption and PCa risk (OR=0.84, 95% CI (0.71-0.98)); tea consumption could reduce PCa risk in China and India (OR=0.40 and 0.48, 95% CI (0.25-0.66) and (0.24-0.97), respectively); both green and black tea consumption showed no significant effect on PCa risk (OR=0.73 and 0.95, 95% CI (0.52-1.02) and (0.82-1.11), respectively); the highest level tea consumption showed significant protective effect on the low-grade PCa (OR=0.66, 95% CI (0.46-0.93)); no significant effect was found in both localized and advanced PCa in stage subgroup analyses (OR=1.12 and 0.85, 95% CI (0.82-1.54) and (0.62-1.16), respectively). The results show that regardless of tea type, tea consumption might be a potential protective factor for the PCa, especially in China and India. Tea consumption might be the protective factor for low-grade PCa. However, more relevant studies are needed to further explore this association.","['Prostatic neoplasm', 'doseresponse', 'metaanalysis', 'progression', 'tea']"
Validity of a Multi-Sensor Armband for Estimating Energy Expenditure during Eighteen Different Activities.,"To examine the validity of an armband physical activity monitor in estimating energy expenditure (EE) over a wide range of physical activities.68 participants (mean age=39.5 ± 13.0 yrs) performed one of three routines consisting of six activities (approximately 10 min each) while wearing the armband and the Cosmed K4b<sup>2</sup> portable metabolic unit. Routine 1 (n=25) involved indoor home-based activities, routine 2 (n=22) involved miscellaneous activities, and routine 3 (n=21) involved outdoor aerobic activities.Mean differences between the EE values in METs (criterion minus estimated) are as follows. Routine 1: watching TV (-0.1), reading (-0.1), laundry (0.1), ironing (-1.3), light cleaning (-0.4), and aerobics (0.4). Routine 2: driving (-0.6), Frisbee golf (-0.9), grass trimming (-0.5), gardening (-1.5), moving dirt with a wheelbarrow (-0.1), loading and unloading boxes (0.1); Routine 3: sidewalk walking (-1.0), track walking (-0.8), walking with a bag (-0.6), tennis (1.6), track running (2.2), and road running (2.1). The armband significantly overestimated EE during several light-to-moderate intensity activities such as driving (by 74%), ironing (by 70%), gardening (by 55%), light cleaning (by 15%), Frisbee golf (by 24%), and sidewalk walking (by 26%) (P<0.05). The arm band significantly underestimated high intensity activities including tennis (by 20%), and track or road running (by 20%).Although the armband provided mean EE estimates within 16% of the criterion for nine of the 18 activities, predictions for several activities were significantly different from the criterion. The armband prediction algorithms could be refined to increase the accuracy of EE estimations.","['Accelerometer', 'Energy expenditure', 'Indirect calorimetry', 'SW armband']"
"Subacute ruminal acidosis downregulates FOXA2, changes oxidative status, and induces autophagy in the livers of dairy cows fed a high-concentrate diet.","The purpose of this experiment was to investigate high-concentrate feeding-induced changed status of oxidative and autophagy in the livers of dairy cows. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 3β (FOXA2) was reported in cases of liver fibrosis, glucolipid metabolism, and hepatocyte differentiation, but not in cases liver damage in cows fed a high-concentrate diet. Therefore, we also aimed to explore the potential role of FOXA2 in SARA-induced liver damage. We divided 12 mid-lactating Holstein cows into 2 groups and fed them a high-concentrate (HC group, forage:concentrate = 4:6) and a low-concentrate (forage:concentrate = 6:4) diet. After a 2-wk adaptation period and a 3-wk experimental period, peripheral blood was collected for determination of antioxidant enzyme activity, and liver tissue was collected to examine genes and proteins. On d 20 and 21 of the experiment, rumen fluid was collected, and the pH was measured. A significant difference in rumen fluid pH was found between the 2 groups (low-concentrate: 6.10 ± 0.07 vs. HC: 5.59 ± 0.09). The rumen fluid pH in the HC group was less than 5.6 at 2 time points, indicating that SARA was successfully induced. Lipopolysaccharide (0.24 ± 0.10 vs. 0.42 ± 0.12) and malondialdehyde (1.46 ± 0.25 vs. 2.94 ± 0.65) increased, whereas superoxide dismutase (14.06 ± 0.63 vs. 11.71 ± 0.64), reduced glutathione (14.48 ± 2.25 vs. 6.82 ± 0.67), and the total antioxidant capacity (0.43 ± 0.03 vs. 0.30 ± 0.03) decreased in the peripheral blood of the HC group. Moreover, in liver tissue from the HC group, catalase (0.71 ± 0.03 vs. 0.49 ± 0.03) and superoxide dismutase (27.46 ± 1.90 vs. 20.32 ± 1.54) were decreased, whereas malondialdehyde (0.21 ± 0.03 vs. 0.28 ± 0.03) was elevated. Meanwhile, we observed lower gene expression of CAT (1.00 ± 0.15 vs. 0.64 ± 0.17), NAD(P)H quinone dehydrogenase 1 (NQO1; 1.00 ± 0.09 vs. 0.47 ± 0.14), glutathione peroxidase 1 (GPX1; 1.03 ± 0.27 vs. 0.55 ± 0.09), SOD1 (1.01 ± 0.17 vs. 0.76 ± 0.17), and SOD3 (1.02 ± 0.21 vs. 0.55 ± 0.16) in the liver tissue of the HC group. Furthermore, western blot analysis showed that high-concentrate feeding led to decreased sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) (1.00 ± 0.10 vs. 0.62 ± 0.15) and FOXA2 (1.02 ± 0.19 vs. 0.68 ± 0.18), elevated autophagy-related protein microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 II (MAP1LC3-II; 1.00 ± 0.32 vs. 1.98 ± 0.83) and autophagy related 5 (ATG5; 1.00 ± 0.30 vs. 1.80 ± 0.27), and suppressed antioxidant signaling pathway-related protein nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (NFE2L2; 1.00 ± 0.18 vs. 0.61 ± 0.30) and heme oxygenase 1 (HMOX1; 1.00 ± 0.48 vs. 0.38 ± 0.25) in liver tissue. Overall, these data indicated that SARA elevated systematic oxidative status and enhanced autophagy in the liver, and suppressed SIRT1 and FOXA2 may mediate enhanced oxidative damage and autophagy in the livers of dairy cows fed a high-concentrate diet.","['FOXA2', 'SARA', 'SIRT1', 'autophagy', 'oxidative stress']"
Close lateral internal sphincterotomy versus open lateral internal sphincterotomy for chronic anal fissure: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Lateral internal sphincterotomy (LIS) has been the gold standard for treating chronic anal fissure (CAF) that persists despite other measures. The authors aim to evaluate the effects of the close method (CLIS) of performing LIS as compared to the open method (OLIS).Databases were searched for relevant studies and results were screened to identify eligible articles, and all concerned outcomes were pooled as odd ratio (OR) or mean difference (MD) with 95% CI in the meta-analysis models using RevMan 5.4.Pooled data from 16 trials with 1,711 patients with idiopathic CAF showed that the CLIS has significant lower risk of delayed fissure healing [OR: 0.28, 95% CI (0.10, 0.77), <i>P</i> = 0.01], duration of hospital stay [MD: -0.82 with 95% CI (-1.07, -0.57), <i>P</i> < 0.00001] and postoperative visual analogue pain score (VAPS) at 24 h [MD: -0.30 with 95% CI (-0.39, -0.21), <i>P</i> < 0.00001]. Also, the risk of overall complications [OR: 0.33 with 95% CI (0.19, 0.55), <i>P</i> < 0.0001], incontinence [OR: 0.28 with 95% CI (0.20, 0.38), <i>P</i> < 0.00001], and postoperative pain [OR: 0.56 with 95% CI (0.35, 0.91), <i>P</i> = 0.02] was significantly lower with CLIS.CLIS is a safer option than OLIS for treating anal fissure. The risk of delayed fissure healing, incontinence, post-op pain and overall complication was significantly lower. However, the risk of surgical site infection, postoperative bleeding and recurrence did not differ. Future research with more prolonged follow-up is necessary to document recurrence reliably.","['anal fissure', 'closed method', 'lateral internal sphincterotomy', 'metaanalysis', 'open method', 'systematic review']"
Treatment response assessment to chemotherapy with bevacizumab for colorectal liver metastasis by contrast-enhanced ultrasound.,"Though contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) perfusion parameters have been approved to be potential indicators for response to chemotherapy in solid tumors, their ability in assessment of colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) to chemotherapy with bevacizumab (Bev) has rarely been investigated.From March 2021 to May 2022, 115 consecutive CRLM patients with CEUS pre- and post-2 months' chemotherapy with Bev were prospectively enrolled. One target lesion per patient underwent CEUS quantitative analysis with SonoLiver software. Rise time, time-to-peak, mean transit time, maximal intensity (IMAX), and area under the time-intensity curve (AUC) were assessed with region of interest (ROI) selected on whole lesion, lesion periphery, and internal lesion, respectively. The reduction and ratio of post- to pre-treatment in parameters were investigated in development cohort (n=89) and validated in internal validation cohort (n=26) according to the chronological order.With modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor as reference, 48, 14 responders and 41, 12 non-responders were included in development and validation cohort, respectively. Significantly smaller values of IMAX and AUC on ROIwhole, ROIperipheral, and ROIinternal, were observed post-treatment in development cohort (all P<0.05). In predicting treatment response, the influence of ROI selection was observed when using ∆IMAX and ∆AUC, while no influence was observed using ratios. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs) for ∆IMAX and ∆AUC on ROIperipheral were 0.939 (0.867-0.979), 0.951 (0.883-0.985), and 0.917 (0.740-0.988), 0.923 (0.748-0.990) in development and validation cohort, respectively. For ratios of IMAX and AUC, AUROCs were 0.976 (0.919-0.997), 0.938 (0.865-0.978), and 0.899 (0.717-0.982), 0.982 (0.836-1.000) in development and validation cohort, respectively.IMAX and AUC showed significant reductions in responders, and different analyses ROIs influence the performance of ∆IMAX and ∆AUC in response assessment. Parameters derived from ROI peripheral exhibited the most promising results in predicting treatment response.","['Contrastenhanced ultrasound CEUS', 'colorectal carcinoma', 'liver metastasis', 'response']"
Exploring the peripheral mechanisms of lower limb immobilisation on muscle function using novel electrophysiological methods.,"To explore the effects of short-term immobilisation and subsequent retraining on peripheral nervous system (PNS) measures using two novel electrophysiological methods, muscle velocity recovery cycles (MVRC) and MScanFit motor unit number estimation (MUNE) alongside lower limb muscle strength, muscle imaging and walking capacity.Twelve healthy participants underwent 1-week of ankle immobilisation and 2-weeks of retraining. Assessments before and after immobilisation, and after retraining, included MVRC [muscle membrane properties; muscle relative refractory period (MRRP), early and late supernormality], MScanFit, MRI-scans [muscle contractile cross-sectional area (cCSA)], isokinetic dynamometry [dorsal and plantar flexor muscle strength], and 2-minute maximal walk test [physical function].After immobilisation, compound muscle action potential (CMAP) amplitude reduced (-1.35[-2.00;-0.69]mV); mean change [95%CI]) alongside reductions in plantar (but not dorsal) flexor muscle cCSA (-124[-246;3]mm<sup>2</sup>), dorsal flexor muscle strength (isometric -0.06[-0.10;-0.02]Nm/kg, dynamic<sub>slow</sub> -0.08[-0.11;-0.04]Nm/kg, dynamic<sub>fast</sub> no changes), plantar flexor muscle strength (isometric -0.20[-0.30;-0.10]Nm/kg, dynamic<sub>slow</sub> -0.19[-0.28;-0.09]Nm/kg, dynamic<sub>fast</sub> -0.12[-0.19;-0.05]Nm/kg) and walking capacity (-31[-39;-23]m). After retraining, all immobilisation-affected parameters returned to baseline levels. In contrast, neither MScanFit nor MVRC were affected apart from slightly prolonged MRRP in gastrocnemius.PNS do not contribute to the changes observed in muscle strength and walking capacity.Further studies should include both corticospinal and peripheral mechanisms.","['Disuse', 'Immobilisation', 'Inactivity', 'MRI', 'MScanFit MUNE', 'MVRC', 'Neuromuscular function', 'Neurophysiology']"
Association between oocyte retrieval technique and number of oocytes retrieved.,"To assess if there is an optimal oocyte retrieval (OR) technique to retrieve a maximum number of oocytes and mature oocytes (MII).Retrospective cohort study in which nine physicians completed a survey on OR techniques. Number of oocytes/follicle cohort, MIIs/follicle cohort, and MIIs/oocytes retrieved (%MII) were assessed for each technique for patients undergoing OR from 3/2013 to 7/2019. Data were stratified by number of follicles on ultrasound on day of trigger (< 6, 6-10, > 10).Patient demographics were equivalent between techniques. For < 6 follicles, three techniques resulted in significantly fewer oocyte/follicle (0.97 ± 0.48, 0.95 ± 0.66, and 0.90 ± 0.41) compared to the top-performing technique (TPT) (1.11 ± 0.55). For 6-10 follicles, two techniques resulted in significantly fewer oocyte/follicle (0.95 ± 0.39 and 0.93 ± 0.35) compared to the TPT (1.06 ± 0.42). A different technique had higher %MII (0.77 ± 0.19) compared to two techniques (0.74 ± 0.21 and 0.72 ± 0.22). For > 10 follicles, two techniques resulted in significantly fewer oocyte/follicle (1.01 ± 0.42 and 1.07 ± 0.40) compared to the TPT (1.15 ± 0.41). These two techniques also resulted in fewer MII/follicle (0.75 ± 0.33 and 0.81 ± 0.34 vs. 0.87 ± 0.34). There was no consistent TPT across follicle number groups or for all outcome variables.There does not appear to be a clear TPT, even for patients with few follicles. Providers who perform OR in a similar fashion to physicians at our institution should feel confident that those techniques obtain equivalent oocyte yields.","['Egg retrieval', 'In vitro fertilization IVF', 'Oocyte retrieval', 'Physician', 'Technique']"
Evaluation of Arab Cultural Barriers That Influence Muslim Arab Iraqi Women's Breast Cancer Screening Behavior.,"Little is known about Iraqi women's practice towards breast cancer screening (BCS), breast self-examination (BSE), clinical breast examination (CBE) and mammography, and the influence of Arab culture. The aim of this study was to assess women's behavior towards BCS, and to explain the influence of specific Arab culture barriers.This descriptive study was carried out with 1,066 women. Three structured questionnaires were used in the data collection. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression were used for data evaluation.Many Iraqi women did not practice regular BSE, CBE, and mammography. The most common reason was ""not having a breast complaint"". Specific Arab cultural barriers such as exposure [odds ratio (OR) = 0.545; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.440 to 0.674; <i>p</i><0.001], environment (OR = 0.571; 95% CI = 0.464 to 0.703; <i>p</i><0.001) and uneasiness barriers (OR = 0.736; 95% CI = 0.557 to 0.974; p=0.032) were predictors for BSE while exposure (OR = 0.553; 95% CI = 0.447 to 0.684; <i>p</i><0.001), and environment barriers (OR = 0.585; 95% CI = 0.474 to 0.772; <i>p</i><0.001) was predictor for CBE. Additionally, exposure (OR = 0.324; 95% CI = 0.251 to 0.419; <i>p</i><0.001), environment (OR = 0.636; 95% CI = 0.500 to 0.809; <i>p</i><0.001), and uneasiness barriers (OR = 0.644; 95% CI = 0.464 to 0.893; <i>p</i> = 0.008) were predictors for mammography screening of Iraqi women.Arab specific cultural barriers may be one of the key obstacles to BSC uptake in Iraq. Health education, including cultural education, may have the potential to increase BCS awareness and down-staging of the disease at presentation.","['Arab culture', 'Muslim Arab Iraqi women', 'barriers', 'breast cancer screening behaviors']"
Predicting chemical ecotoxicity by learning latent space chemical representations.,"In silico prediction of chemical ecotoxicity (HC<sub>50</sub>) represents an important complement to improve in vivo and in vitro toxicological assessment of manufactured chemicals. Recent application of machine learning models to predict chemical HC<sub>50</sub> yields variable prediction performance that depends on effectively learning chemical representations from high-dimension data. To improve HC<sub>50</sub> prediction performance, we developed an autoencoder model by learning latent space chemical embeddings. This novel approach achieved state-of-the-art prediction performance of HC<sub>50</sub> with R<sup>2</sup> of 0.668 ± 0.003 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.572 ± 0.001, and outperformed other dimension reduction methods including principal component analysis (PCA) (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.601 ± 0.031 and MAE = 0.629 ± 0.005), kernel PCA (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.631 ± 0.008 and MAE = 0.625 ± 0.006), and uniform manifold approximation and projection dimensionality reduction (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.400 ± 0.008 and MAE = 0.801 ± 0.002). A simple linear layer with chemical embeddings learned from the autoencoder model performed better than random forest (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.663 ± 0.007 and MAE = 0.591 ± 0.008), fully connected neural network (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.614 ± 0.016 and MAE = 0.610 ± 0.008), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.617 ± 0.037 and MAE = 0.619 ± 0.007), and ridge regression (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.638 ± 0.007 and MAE = 0.613 ± 0.005) using unlearned raw input features. Our results highlighted the usefulness of learning latent chemical representations, and our autoencoder model provides an alternative approach for robust HC<sub>50</sub> prediction.","['Autoencoder', 'Chemical ecotoxicity', 'Dimension reduction', 'Machine learning', 'Representation learning']"
M2 Macrophage Subpopulations in Glomeruli Are Associated With the Deposition of IgG Subclasses and Complements in Primary Membranous Nephropathy.,"<b>Objectives:</b> The role of M2 macrophages in the pathogenesis and progression of primary membranous nephropathy (PMN) remains unknown. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between M2 subsets and clinicopathological features of patients with PMN. <b>Methods:</b> A total of 55 patients with PMN confirmed by biopsy were recruited. The clinical and pathological data were recorded, respectively. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect the markers of M2 macrophages, including total macrophages (CD68+), M2a (CD206+), M2b (CD86+) and M2c (CD163+). <b>Results:</b> The numbers of glomerular macrophages, M2a, M2b, and M2c macrophages were 1.83 (1.00, 2.67), 0.65 (0.15, 1.15), 0.67 (0.33, 1.50), and 0.80 (0.05, 2.30) per glomerulus, respectively. Higher number of glomerular macrophages was found in stage II compared with stage III (2.08 vs. 1.16, <i>P</i> = 0.008). These macrophages also were negatively correlated with serum albumin level (<i>r</i> = -0.331, <i>P</i> = 0.014), while positively associated with complement 3 (C3) deposition (<i>r</i> = 0.300, <i>P</i> = 0.026) and the severity of glomerulosclerosis (<i>r</i> = 0.276, <i>P</i> = 0.041). Moreover, glomerular M2a macrophages were significantly correlated with the deposition of C3 (<i>r</i> = 0.300, <i>P</i> = 0.026), immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) (<i>r</i> = 0.339, <i>P</i> = 0.011), immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) (<i>r</i> = 0.270, <i>P</i> = 0.046) and immunoglobulin G3 (IgG3) (<i>r</i> = 0.330, <i>P</i> = 0.014) in glomerular basement membrane (GBM). In addition, M2b macrophages were positively associated with IgG1 (<i>r</i> = 0.295, <i>P</i> = 0.029) and IgG2 (<i>r</i> = 0.393, <i>P</i> = 0.003), while M2c macrophages were negatively correlated with complement 4d (C4d) (<i>r</i> = -0.347, <i>P</i> = 0.009) in GBM. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our results showed that M2 macrophage subpopulations in glomeruli are associated with the deposition of IgG subclasses and complements in renal tissue of PMN, which indicate that M2 macrophages may be involved in the pathogenesis and progression of PMN. Moreover, M2a and M2c macrophages might show different tendencies in the pathogenesis of PMN.","['M2 macrophages', 'M2 subpopulations', 'complement', 'immunoglobulin', 'primary membranous nephropathy']"
Quantitative susceptibility-weighted imaging in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis with 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging.,"To evaluate alterations in phase-shift values in the gray matter of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI).Twenty patients with definite or probable ALS and 19 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. SWI was performed using a 3.0 T magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Phase-shift values were measured in corrected phase images using regions of interest, which were placed on the bilateral precentral gyrus, frontal cortex, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, and putamen.Phase-shift values of the precentral gyrus were significantly lower in ALS patients (-0.176 ± 0.050) than in the control group (-0.119 ± 0.016) on SWI. The average phase-shift values of the frontal cortex, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, and putamen in ALS patients (-0.089 ± 0.023, -0.065 ± 0.016, -0.336 ± 0.191, and -0.227 ± 0.101, respectively) were not significantly different from those in the healthy controls (-0.885 ± 0.015, -0.079 ± 0.018, -0.329 ± 0.136, and -0.229 ± 0.083, respectively).Compared with healthy controls, ALS patients had a lower phase-shift value in the precentral gyrus, which may be related to abnormal iron overload. Thus, SWI is a potential method for identifying ALS patients.","['Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis', 'magnetic resonance imaging', 'motor neuron disease', 'phaseshift values', 'quantitative susceptibility mapping', 'susceptibilityweighted imaging']"
Predictive ability of a comprehensive incremental test in mountain bike marathon.,"Traditional performance tests in mountain bike marathon (XCM) primarily quantify aerobic metabolism and may not describe the relevant capacities in XCM. We aimed to validate a comprehensive test protocol quantifying its intermittent demands.Forty-nine athletes (38.8±9.1 years; 38 male; 11 female) performed a laboratory performance test, including an incremental test, to determine individual anaerobic threshold (IAT), peak power output (PPO) and three maximal efforts (10 s all-out sprint, 1 min maximal effort and 5 min maximal effort). Within 2 weeks, the athletes participated in one of three XCM races (n=15, n=9 and n=25). Correlations between test variables and race times were calculated separately. In addition, multiple regression models of the predictive value of laboratory outcomes were calculated for race 3 and across all races (z-transformed data).All variables were correlated with race times 1, 2 and 3: 10 s all-out sprint (r=-0.72; r=-0.59; r=-0.61), 1 min maximal effort (r=-0.85; r=-0.84; r=-0.82), 5 min maximal effort (r=-0.57; r=-0.85; r=-0.76), PPO (r=-0.77; r=-0.73; r=-0.76) and IAT (r=-0.71; r=-0.67; r=-0.68). The best-fitting multiple regression models for race 3 (r<sup>2</sup>=0.868) and across all races (r<sup>2</sup>=0.757) comprised 1 min maximal effort, IAT and body weight.Aerobic and intermittent variables correlated least strongly with race times. Their use in a multiple regression model confirmed additional explanatory power to predict XCM performance. These findings underline the usefulness of the comprehensive incremental test to predict performance in that sport more precisely.","['lactate anaerobic', 'mountain biking', 'performance', 'testing']"
Differences in preschool-age children's dietary intake between meals consumed at childcare and at home.,"Preschool children need optimal nutrition, including a variety of nutrient-dense foods, for growth and development. The purpose of this study was to determine differences in foods and nutrients consumed at childcare and home environments. Children ages 3-to-5 years (<i>n</i> = 90, 3.8 ± 0.7 years; 56% female) from 16 childcare centers participated in this cross-sectional study from 2011 to 2014. Lunches at childcare were observed for two days; three days of dinners at home were reported by caregivers. Nutrient-dense and energy-dense foods were counted and nutrient content of meals was determined using FoodWorks®. More servings of fruit (0.92 ± 0.82 vs. 0.15 ± 0.26; <i>p</i> ≤ 0.0001), vegetables (1.47 ± 1.43 vs. 0.62 ± 0.60; <i>p</i> ≤ 0.0001), and low-fat dairy (0.83 ± 0.32 vs. 0.07 ± 0.19; <i>p</i> ≤ 0.0001) were consumed at childcare than at home. More servings of high-fat, high-sugar <i>foods</i> (0.08 ± 0.18 vs. 0.43 ± 0.39, <i>p</i> ≤ 0.0001) and sugary drinks (0.22 ± 0.41 vs. 0.39 ± 0.35. <i>p</i> ≤ 0.001) were consumed at home than at childcare. There were no differences between environments in whole-grains, high-fat meats, or high-fat high-sugar <i>condiments</i> consumed. On average, children consumed 333.0 ± 180.3 kcal at childcare and 454.7 ± 175.3 at home (<i>p</i> ≤ 0.0001). There were no differences in macronutrient profiles or in iron, zinc, folate, or vitamin B6 intake. More calcium (86.2 ± 44.6 vs. 44.6 ± 22.2 mg/kcal, <i>p</i> ≤ 0.0001) and vitamin A/kcal (56.1 ± 36.9 vs. 26.5 ± 24.2 RAE/kcal, <i>p</i> ≤ 0.0001) were consumed at childcare than at home. Preschool children are consuming more nutrient-dense foods and a more servings of fruit and vegetables at childcare during lunch than at home during dinner. Childcare and parents should work together to provide early and consistent exposure to nutrient-rich foods to ensure optimal nutrition for developing children.","['Childcare', 'Dietary intake', 'Home']"
"Phenotypic and genetic relationships between age at first calving, its component traits, and survival of heifers up to second calving.","The aim of this study was to answer the question whether models for genetic evaluations of longevity should include a correction for age at first calving (AFC). For this purpose, phenotypic and genetic relationships between AFC, its component traits age at first insemination (AFI) and interval from first to last insemination (FLI), and survival of different periods of the first lactation (S1: 0 to 49 d, S2: 50 to 249 d, S3: 250 d to second calving) were investigated. Data of 721,919 German Holstein heifers, being inseminated for the first time during the years from 2003 to 2012, were used for the analyses. Phenotypic correlations of AFI, FLI, and AFC to S1 to S3 were negative. Mean estimated heritabilities were 0.239 (AFI), 0.007 (FLI), and 0.103 (AFC) and 0.023 (S1), 0.016 (S2), and 0.028 (S3) on the observed scale. The genetic correlation between AFI and FLI was close to zero. Genetic correlations between AFI and the survival traits were -0.08 (S1), -0.02 (S2), and -0.10 (S3); those between FLI and the survival traits were -0.14 (S1), -0.20 (S2), and -0.44 (S3); and those between AFC and the survival traits were -0.09 (S1), -0.06 (S2), and -0.20 (S3). Some of these genetic correlations were different from zero, which suggests that correcting for AFC in genetic evaluations for longevity in dairy cows might remove functional genetic variance and should be reconsidered.","['age at first calving', 'age at first insemination', 'longevity', 'survival']"
Impact of Cognitive Disturbances and Clinical Symptoms on Disability in Patients with Paranoid Schizophrenia: A Study of a Bulgarian Clinical Sample.,"The study aimed to assess the impact of clinical symptoms and cognitive impairment on disability in patients with paranoid schizophrenia (PS).108 patients with schizophrenia were included (66 male and 42 female). Their average age was 38.86 ± 10.02 years and the disease duration was 12.80 ± 8.20 years, with mean disease onset of 24 years. Clinical symptoms were assessed with the PANSS, and cognitive performance was measured using a seven-item neurocognitive battery. The disability level of the subjects was assessed using the World Health Organization-Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 (WHO-DAS 2.0). The relation between the variables studied was assessed using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (<i>r<sub>s</sub></i>) at a probability level of <i>p</i> < 0.05.An increase in symptom severity resulted in worsening of the ""participation in society"" (<i>r</i> = 0.56, <i>p</i> < 0.01), ""life activities-household"" (<i>r</i> = 0.55, <i>p</i> < 0.01), and ""getting along with people"" (<i>r</i> = 0.59, <i>p</i> < 0.01) WHO-DAS 2.0 domains. Positive symptoms (13.89 ± 3.48) correlated strongly with ""getting along with people"" (<i>r</i> = 0.55, <i>p</i> < 0.01), ""life activities-household"" (<i>r</i> = 0.58, <i>p</i> < 0.01), and ""participation in society"" (<i>r</i> = 0.62, <i>p</i> < 0.01), and negative symptoms (14.25 ± 4.16) with ""participation in society"" (<i>r</i> = 0.53, <i>p</i> < 0.01) and ""life activities-household"" (<i>r</i> = 0.48, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Symptoms of disorganization (15.67 ± 4.16) had the highest impact on ""life activities-household"" (<i>r</i> = 0.81, <i>p</i> < 0.01), ""getting along with people"" (<i>r</i> = 0.56, <i>p</i> < 0.05), and ""participation in society"" (<i>r</i> = 0.65, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Episodic memory (<i>r</i> = -0.28, <i>p</i> < 0.01) was remotely related to comprehension and communication. The information processing speed (<i>r<sub>s</sub></i> = 0.38, <i>p</i> < 0.01), visual memory (<i>r<sub>s</sub></i> = -0.30, <i>p</i> < 0.01), and focused executive functions showed moderate correlations with all domains on the WHO-DAS 2.0 scale (<i>r<sub>s</sub></i> = 0.38, <i>p</i> < 0.01). Attention (<i>r<sub>s</sub></i> = -0.33, <i>p</i> < 0.01) was moderately related to community activities. Semantic (<i>r<sub>s</sub></i> = -0.29, <i>p</i> < 0.01) and literal (<i>r<sub>s</sub></i> = -0.27, <i>p</i> < 0.01) verbal fluency demonstrated weak correlations with ""cognition-understanding"", ""getting along with people"", and ""participation in society"".Symptoms of disorganization and disturbed executive functions contribute most to disability in patients with schizophrenia through impairment of real-world functioning, especially in social interactions and communication. Severe clinical symptoms (negative and disorganization-related ones) as well as deficits in executive function, verbal memory, and verbal fluency cause the biggest problems in the functional domains of interaction with other people and participation in society.","['WHODAS 20', 'cognitive symptoms', 'disability', 'negative', 'positive', 'psychosocial functioning', 'schizophrenia']"
The associations of dietary folate and serum folate with lipid profiles: findings from the national health and nutrition examination survey 2011-2016.,"Folate is considered to be related to lipid metabolism. With the increasing numbers of folic acid fortification nations, the associations of dietary folate and serum folate with lipid profiles deserve more attention and are worth further study.US adults aged ≥ 20 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were evaluated. Participants taking folic acid supplements were excluded. The multivariate linear regression model and smooth curve fitting were applied to assess the associations. The segmented regression model was employed to examine the threshold effect of nonlinear relationships.Our cross-sectional study included 3706 participants in total. There was a negative relationship between serum folate (log transformed) and triglycerides (β = -0.223, 95% CI: -0.337, -0.110) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (β = -0.152, 95% CI: -0.296, -0.007) and a positive relationship between serum folate (log transformed) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (β = 0.090, 95% CI: 0.033,0.146). There was a negative association between dietary folate (log transformed) and total cholesterol (TC) (β = -0.299, 95% CI: -0.465, -0.134) and LDL-C (β = -0.266, 95% CI: -0.409, -0.123). A nonlinear relationship was found between dietary folate (log transformed) and HDL-C. Threshold effect analysis showed that the inflection point was 377.57 ug. Within the inflection point, the β-coefficient of HDL-C was 0.105 (95% CI: 0.018, 0.192); beyond the inflection point, there was no relationship (β = -0.067, 95% CI: -0.162, 0.028).Optimal dietary folate and high serum folate were associated with favorable lipid profiles. Dietary folate, in the recommended 300-400 ug/d, had a beneficial effect on improving lipid profiles.","['A crosssectional study', 'Folate', 'Lipid profiles', 'NHANES']"
Analysis of the Effects of Electronic Medical Records and a Payment Scheme on the Length of Hospital Stay.,"This study analyzed the effects of computerization of medical information systems and a hospital payment scheme on medical care outcomes. Specifically, we examined the effects of Electronic Medical Records (EMRs) and a diagnosis procedure combination/per-diem payment scheme (DPC/PDPS) on the average length of hospital stay (ALOS).Post-intervention changes in the monthly ALOS were measured using an interrupted time-series analysis.The level changes observed in the monthly ALOS immediately post-DPC/PDPS were -1.942 (95% confidence interval [CI], -2.856 to -1.028), -1.885 (95% CI, -3.176 to -0.593), -1.581 (95% CI, -3.081 to -0.082) and -2.461 (95% CI, -3.817 to 1.105) days in all ages, <50, 50-64, and ≥65 years, respectively. During the post-DPC/PDPS period, trends of 0.107 (95% CI, 0.069 to 0.144), 0.048 (95% CI, -0.006 to 0.101), 0.183 (95% CI, 0.122 to 0.245) and 0.110 (95% CI, 0.054 to 0.167) days/month, respectively, were observed. During the post-EMR period, trends of -0.053 (95% CI, -0.080 to -0.027), -0.093 (95% CI, -0.135 to -0.052), and -0.049 (95% CI, -0.087 to -0.012) days/month were seen for all ages, 50-64 and ≥65 years, respectively.The increasing post-DPC/PDPS trends offset the decline in ALOS observed immediately post-DPC/PDPS, and the observed ALOS was longer than the counterfactual at the end of the DPC/PDPS study periods. Conversely, due to the downward trend seen after EMR introduction, the actual ALOS at the end of the EMR study period was shorter than the counterfactual, suggesting that EMRs might be more effective than the DPC/PDPS in sustainably reducing the LOS.","['Electronic Medical Records', 'Length of Stay', 'Longitudinal Studies', 'Prospective Payment System', 'Quality of Health Care']"
HIIT is not superior to MICT in altering blood lipids: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To compare the effects of moderate intensity continuous training (MICT) and high intensity interval training (HIIT) on adult lipid profiles; to identify training or participant characteristics that may determine exercise-induced change in total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TRG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C).Systematic review and meta-analysis.English language searches of several databases were conducted from inception until September 2019.Inclusion: (1) published randomised controlled human trials with group population n≥5; (2) intervention duration ≥4 weeks; (3) comparing HIIT with MICT; and (4) reporting pre-post intervention lipid measurements. Exclusion: subjects with chronic disease, <18 years, pregnant/lactating, in elite athletic training; and studies with a dietary or pharmaceutical intervention component.Twenty-nine data sets (mmol/L) of 823 participants were pooled and analysed. Neither HIIT nor MICT was better in decreasing TC (0.10 (-0.06 to 0.19), p=0.12, I<sup>2</sup>=0%), TRG (-0.05 (-0.11 to 0.01), p=0.10, I<sup>2</sup>=0%), LDL-C (0.05 (-0.06 to 0.17), p=0.37, I<sup>2</sup>=0%), or TC/HDL-C (-0.03 (-0.36 to 0.29), p=0.85, I<sup>2</sup>=0%). HIIT significantly raised HDL-C (0.07 (0.04 to 0.11), p<0.0001, I<sup>2</sup>=0%) compared with MICT.Neither HIIT nor MICT is superior for altering TC, TRG, or LDL-C, or TC-HDL-C ratio. Compared with MICT, HIIT appeared to significantly improve HDL-C. Clinicians may prescribe either protocol to encourage participation in exercise and reduce cardiovascular risk. To raise HDL-C, HIIT may result in a larger effect size compared with MICT.CRD42019136722.","['cholesterol', 'exercise intensity', 'exercise training', 'lipids', 'lipoprotein', 'triglycerides']"
A review and meta-analysis of corneal cross-linking for post-laser vision correction ectasia.,"The aim of this study was to review the safety and stability of cornea cross-linking (CXL) for the treatment of keratectasia after Excimer Laser Refractive Surgery.Eligible studies were identified by systematically searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and reference lists. Meta-analysis was performed using Stata 12.1 software. The primary outcome parameters included the changes of corrected distant visual acuity (CDVA), uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA), the maximum keratometry value (Kmax) and minimum keratometry value (Kmin), the surface regularity index (SRI), the surface asymmetry index (SAI), the keratoconus prediction index (KPI), corneal thickness, and endothelial cell count. Efficacy estimates were evaluated by weighted mean difference (WMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for absolute changes of the interested outcomes.Seven studies involving 118 patients treated with CXL for progressive ectasia after laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) or photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) (140 eyes; the follow-up time range from 12 to 62 months) were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled results showed that there were no significant differences in Kmax and Kmin values after CXL (WMD = 0.584; 95% CI: -0.289 to 1.458; <i>P</i> = 0.19; WMD = 0.466; 95% CI: -0.625 to 1.556; <i>P</i> = 0.403, respectively). The CDVA improved significantly after CXL (WMD = 0.045; 95% CI: 0.010 to 0.079; <i>P</i> = 0.011), whereas UCVA did not differ statistically (WMD = 0.011; 95% CI: -0.055 to 0.077; <i>P</i> = 0.746). The changes were not statistically significant in SRI, SAI, and KPI (WMD = 0.116; 95% CI: -0.090 to 0.322; <i>P</i> = 0.269; WMD = 0.240; 95% CI: -0.200 to 0.681; <i>P</i> = 0.285; WMD = 0.045; 95% CI: -0.001 to 0.090; <i>P</i> = 0.056, respectively). Endothelial cell count and corneal thickness did not deteriorate (WMD = 12.634; 95% CI: -29.460 to 54.729; <i>P</i> = 0.556; WMD = 0.657; 95% CI: -9.402 to 10.717; <i>P</i> = 0.898, respectively).The study showed that CXL is a promising treatment to stabilize the keratectasia after Excimer Laser Refractive Surgery. Further long-term follow-up studies are necessary to assess the persistence of the effect of the CXL.","['Crosslinking', 'Keratectasia', 'Metaanalysis', 'Refractive surgery']"
Acceptance and commitment therapy reduces psychological distress in patients with cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"This study aimed to systematically review and meta-analyze the clinical efficacy of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) in patients with cancer and psychological distress.Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from seven English electronic databases were systematically investigated from inception to 3 October 2023. A total of 16 RCTs from 6 countries with 711 participants were included in this study. Estimated pooled effect sizes (ESs) were calculated via inverse-variance random-effects or fixed-effects (I<sup>2</sup> ≤ 50%) model and presented by standardized mean difference (SMD). Subgroup analyses were performed to reduce confounding factors and heterogeneity, and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) system was used to evaluate the quality of the pooled ESs.The pooled ESs revealed that statistically significant improvements in anxiety [postintervention SMD = -0.41 (95% confidence interval (CI), -0.71, -0.11); <i>p</i> = 0.008; I<sup>2</sup> = 65%; follow-up SMD = -0.37 (95% CI, -0.66, -0.08); <i>p</i> = 0.01; I<sup>2</sup> = 29%], depression [postintervention SMD = -0.45 (95% CI, -0.63, -0.27); <i>p</i> < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 49%; follow-up SMD = -0.52 (95% CI, -0.77, -0.28); <i>p</i> < 0.001; I<sup>2</sup> = 0%], and psychological flexibility [postintervention SMD = -0.81 (95% CI, -1.50, -0.11); <i>p</i> = 0.02; I<sup>2</sup> = 84%; follow-up SMD = -0.71 (95% CI, -1.12, -0.31); <i>p</i> = 0.0006; I<sup>2</sup> = 38%] in ACT-treated participants were observed compared to patients treated with control conditions. However, other outcomes, such as physical symptom alleviation, were not significantly associated.The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that ACT is associated with improvements in anxiety, depression, and psychological flexibility in patients with cancer.https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42022320515.","['acceptance and commitment therapy', 'anxiety', 'cancer', 'metaanalysis', 'neoplasms', 'psychological distress', 'systematic review']"
The Relationship between Metformin Consumption and Cancer Risk: An Updated Umbrella Review of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.,"Considering that metformin is widely used in the treatment of diabetes, and its protective role against various malignancies, the strength and validity of the available evidence from related systematic reviews and meta-analysis were evaluated.Scopus, PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, Web of science databases, and Google Scholar and manual screening of retrieved references were systematically searched from their inception dates to 24 March 2020 by extracting the effect size (Odds ratios (OR) and relative risk (RR) in each study. To present the forest plot of effect of metformin on each cancer, Stata version 14.2 was used.This study included 36 meta-analysis studies and 620 original research studies (26 randomized control trials studies and 594 observational studies (cohort, case-control)) covering 15 different cancers. Overall, metformin medication prevented different cancers, including ovarian cancer (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.62,0.93), cervical cancer (OR = 0.60, 95% CI: 0.43, 0.83), endometrial cancer (OR = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.82,1.35), liver cancer (OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.47,0.74), pancreatic cancer (OR = 0.59, 95%CI 0.50,0.69), head and neck cancer (OR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.61,0.83), stomach cancer (OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.26,1.99), colorectal cancer (OR = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.59,0.91), colorectal adenoma cancer (OR = 0.75, 95% CI: 0.65,0.86), colon cancer (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.69,0.91), esophagus cancer (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.83,0.98), lung cancer (OR = 0.92, CI95%:0.85,0.99), breast cancer (OR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.84,1.02), prostate cancer (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.85-1.04), and bladder cancer (OR = 0.94 95% CI: 0.64,1.38).Treatment with metformin can significantly decrease the chance of all cancers with larger preventive effect on hepatocellular carcinoma and smaller preventive effect on lung and breast cancers.","['Diabetes mellitus', 'metaanalysis', 'metformin', 'neoplasms', 'review']"

First of all, the four functionals, such as GGA with PBE, GGA with RPBE, GGA with WC and LDA with CA-PZ functionals were used for primary screening of electronic band structure and structural geometry for ZnAg<sub>2</sub>GeS<sub>4</sub> while the band gap was in 0.93, 0.97, 0.77 and 0.67 eV, respectively. It must be mentioned that the experimental value of ZnAg<sub>2</sub>GeS<sub>4</sub> was 0.94 eV so that the GGA with PBE showed the overlapping value of band gap. The main focus of this paper is to evaluate the band structure of newly predicted the stannite type quarterly crystal, ZnAg<sub>2</sub>GeSe<sub>4</sub> using four methods replacing the Sulfur atom by Serium atom on ZnAg<sub>2</sub>GeS<sub>4</sub>. The band gap for four methods, such as GGA with PBE, GGA with RPBE, GGA with WC and LDA with CA-PZ functionals, were calculated in 0.84 eV, 0.92 eV, 0.68 eV and 0.58 eV.

Comparison of Prior Bridging Intravenous Thrombolysis With Direct Endovascular Thrombectomy for Anterior Circulation Large Vessel Occlusion: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"<b>Background:</b> Whether bridging treatment combining intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) and endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) is superior to direct EVT alone for emergent large vessel occlusion (LVO) in the anterior circulation is unknown. A systematic review and a meta-analysis were performed to investigate and assess the effect and safety of bridging treatment <i>vs</i>. direct EVT in patients with LVO in the anterior circulation. <b>Methods:</b> PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library were searched to assess the effect and safety of bridging treatment and direct EVT in LVO. Functional independence, mortality, asymptomatic and symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (aICH and sICH, respectively), and successful recanalization were evaluated. The risk ratio and the 95% CI were analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Among the eight studies included, there was no significant difference in the long-term functional independence (OR = 1.008, 95% CI = 0.845-1.204, <i>P</i> = 0.926), mortality (OR = 1.060, 95% CI = 0.840-1.336, <i>P</i> = 0.624), recanalization rate (OR = 1.015, 95% CI = 0.793-1.300, <i>P</i> = 0.905), and the incidence of sICH (OR = 1.320, 95% CI = 0.931-1.870, <i>P</i> = 0.119) between bridging therapy and direct EVT. After adjusting for confounding factors, bridging therapy showed a lower recanalization rate (effect size or ES = -0.377, 95% CI = -0.684 to -0.070, <i>P</i> = 0.016), but there was no significant difference in the long-term functional independence (ES = 0.057, 95% CI = -0.177 to 0.291, <i>P</i> = 0.634), mortality (ES = 0.693, 95% CI = -0.133 to 1.519, <i>P</i> = 0.100), and incidence of sICH (ES = -0.051, 95% CI = -0.687 to 0.585, <i>P</i> = 0.875) compared with direct EVT.

Significance of Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin as a Biomarker for the Diagnosis of Diabetic Kidney Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a promising marker for the diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease (DKD), but its utility is currently debated. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the diagnostic value of NGAL for DKD.MEDLINE, Embase, -Cochrane Library, CNKI, and CBM databases were searched up to April 13, 2019. In bivariate random-effect models, the diagnostic performance of NGAL for DKD was assessed using pooled estimates of sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio, diagnostic odds ratio, and hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic analysis.Nineteen studies were eligible for the meta-analysis. Serum NGAL had a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.79 (95% confidence intervals [CI] 0.60-0.91) and 0.87 (0.75-0.93) (7 studies, 1,238 patients). The pooled positive likelihood ratio (LR+) and negative likelihood ratio (LR-) were 5.97 (3.03-11.76) and 0.24 (0.11-0.51). For urine NGAL, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, LR+, and LR- were 0.85 (0.74-0.91), 0.74 (0.57-0.86), 3.26 (1.87-5.67), and 0.21 (0.12-0.35), respectively (10 studies, 1,369 patients). The pooled sensitivity and specificity for kidney disease in normoalbuminuric patients with diabetes was 0.90 (0.82-0.95) and 0.97 (0.90-0.99) for both serum NGAL and 0.94 (0.87-0.98) and 0.90 (0.81-0.96) for urine NGAL (4 studies, 221 patients). NGAL appeared to perform similarly in subgroup analysis.The meta-analysis has shown that NGAL may be useful for DKD classification and also has a potential diagnostic value for normoalbuminuric kidney disease. Large-scale prospective studies are required to clarify its role in the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with DKD.","['Diabetic kidney disease', 'Metaanalysis', 'Neutrophil gelatinaseassociated lipocalin']"
Effect of caudal ketamine on minimum local anesthetic concentration of ropivacaine in children: a prospective randomized trial.,"Caudal ketamine has been shown to provide an effective and prolonged post-operative analgesia with few adverse effects. However, the effect of caudal ketamine on the minimum local anesthetic concentration (MLAC) of ropivacaine for intra-operative analgesia is unclear.One hundred and sixty-nine children were randomized to five groups: Group C (caudal ropivacaine only), Group K<sub>0.25</sub> (caudal ropivacaine plus 0.25 mg/kg ketamine), Group K<sub>0.5</sub> (caudal ropivacaine plus 0.5 mg/kg ketamine), Group K<sub>0.75</sub> (caudal ropivacaine plus 0.75 mg/kg ketamine), and Group K<sub>1.0</sub> (caudal ropivacaine plus 1.0 mg/kg ketamine). The primary outcome was the MLAC values of ropivacaine with/without ketamine for caudal block.The MLAC values of ropivacaine were 0.128% (0.028%) in the control group, 0.112% (0.021%) in Group K<sub>0.25</sub>, 0.112% (0.018%) in Group K<sub>0.5</sub>, 0.110% (0.019%) in Group K<sub>0.75</sub>, and 0.110% (0.020%) in Group K<sub>1.0</sub>. There were no significant differences among the five groups for the MLAC values (p = 0.11). During the post-operative period the mean durations of analgesia were 270, 381, 430, 494, and 591 min in the control, K<sub>0.25</sub>, K<sub>0. 5</sub>, K<sub>0.75</sub>, and K<sub>1.0</sub> groups respectively, which shown that control group is significantly different from all ketamine groups. Also there were significant differences between K<sub>0.25</sub> and K<sub>0.75</sub> groups, and between K<sub>1.0</sub> groups and the other ketamine groups.Adding caudal ketamine to ropivacaine prolong the duration of post-operative analgesia; however, it does not decrease the MLAC of caudal ropivacaine for intra-operative analgesia in children.ChiCTR-TRC-13003492.

Leisure time physical activity is associated with improved diastolic heart function and is partly mediated by unsupervised quantified metabolic health.,"To investigate the association between leisure time physical activity (LTPA) and MRI-based diastolic function and the mediating role of metabolic health.This cross-sectional analysis comprised 901 participants (46% women, mean age (SD): 56 (6) years (The Netherlands, 2008-2012)). LTPA was assessed via questionnaire, quantified in metabolic equivalent of tasks (METs)-minutes per week and participants underwent abdominal and cardiovascular MRI. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to construct the metabolic load factor. Piecewise structural equation model with adjustments for confounders was used to determine associations between LTPA and diastolic function and the mediating effect of metabolic load.Significant differences in mitral early/late peak filling rate (E/A) ratio per SD of LTPA (men=1999, women=1870 MET-min/week) of 0.18, (95% CI= 0.03 to 0.33, p=0.021) were observed in men, but not in women: -0.01 (-0.01 to 0.34, p=0.058). Difference in deceleration time of mitral early filling (E-DT) was 0.13 (0.01 to 0.24, p=0.030) in men and 0.17 (0.05 to 0.28, p=0.005) in women. Metabolic load, including MRI-based visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue, fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides, mediated these associations as follows: E/A-ratio of 0.030 (0.000 to 0.067, 19% mediated, p=0.047) in men but not in women: 0.058 (0.027 to 0.089, p<0.001) and E-DT not in men 0.004 (-0.012 to 0.021, p=0.602) but did in women 0.044 (0.013 to 0.057, 27% mediated, p=0.006).A larger amount of LTPA was associated with improved diastolic function where confirmatory factor analysis-based metabolic load partly mediated this effect. Future studies should assess whether improving indicators of metabolic load alongside LTPA will benefit healthy diastolic function even more.","['MRI', 'cardiology', 'cardiovascular epidemiology', 'metabolism', 'physical activity']"
A meta-analysis on the impact of resistance training on phase angle in middle-aged and older individuals.,"To determine the impact of resistance training (RT) on phase angle (PhA) in middle-aged and older individuals via meta-analysis, explore effects in subgroups, and identify optimal RT protocol.We searched five databases using predefined criteria, assessed literature quality per Cochrane 5.1 Handbook, and used Revman 5.3 for effect size aggregation, bias assessment, sensitivity analysis, and subgroup analysis.RT improved PhA in middle-aged and older individuals (d = 0.34, 95 % CI: 0.27-0.40, P < 0.05). Effective subgroups included Suspension (d = 0.62, 95 % CI: 0.33-0.90, P < 0.05), free-weights and machine (d = 0.36, 95 % CI: 0.28-0.45, P < 0.05), equipment training (d = 0.24, 95 % CI: 0.13-0.36, P < 0.05), and moderate-intensity RT (d = 0.34, 95 % CI: 0.27-0.42, P < 0.05). RT was conducted 2-3 times/week (d = 0.20, 95 % CI: 0.01-0.38, P < 0.05) or (d = 0.38, 95 % CI: 0.30-0.47, P < 0.05). PhA improved after 8 weeks (d = 0.37, 95 % CI: 0.23-0.51, P < 0.05), 12 weeks (d = 0.35, 95 % CI: 0.26-0.44, P < 0.05), and ≥ 24 weeks (d = 0.26, 95 % CI: 0.11-0.41, P < 0.05) of RT in aged and older individuals. Low- and high-intensity RT, elastic band training, and weekly exercises did not significantly improve PhA.RT enhances PhA in middle-aged and older adults.

Clinical outcomes of recommended active pharmacotherapy agents from NICE guideline for post-traumatic stress disorder: Network meta-analysis.,"Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental disorder that can emerge after an individual experiences a traumatic event such as physical abuse, sexual/relationship violence, combat exposure, witnessing death, or serious injury. This study aimed to identify the most suitable drugs for the management of PTSD based on a network meta-analysis (NMA).Six databases (Ovid Medline, EMBase, CENTRAL, PsycINFO, Ovid Health and Psychosocial Instruments, and Web of Science) were searched from inception to September 6, 2022.Thirty articles with a total of 5170 participants were included. Compared with placebo, active drugs including olanzapine (SMD = -0.66, 95% CI: -1.19 to -0.13), risperidone (SMD = -0.23, 95% CI: -0.42 to -0.03), quetiapine (SMD = -0.49, 95% CI: -0.93 to -0.04), venlafaxine (SMD = -0.29, 95% CI: -0.42 to -0.16), sertraline (SMD = -0.23, 95% CI: -0.34 to -0.11), paroxetine (SMD = -0.48, 95% CI: -0.60 to -0.36) and fluoxetine (SMD = -0.27, 95% CI: -0.42 to -0.12), significantly reduced the total clinician-administered PTSD scale score.The results of this study support the use of paroxetine, venlafaxine, and quetiapine as first-line treatment for PTSD. In addition, quetiapine is recommended for patients with PTSD affected by symptoms of hyperarousal and re-experience disorder. Clinicians should prescribe medications based on the severity of PTSD symptoms and other conditions to develop the best treatment strategy for this patient population.","['Paroxetine', 'Posttraumatic stress disorder', 'Quetiapine', 'Total clinician administered PTSD scale', 'Venlafaxine']"
"Long-term comparative effectiveness and safety of dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban in patients with atrial fibrillation: A nationwide cohort study.","<b>Background:</b> Although non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are recommended over vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) in atrial fibrillation (AF) management, direct long-term head-to-head comparisons are lacking. Therefore, their risk-benefit profiles were investigated compared to VKAs and between NOACs. <b>Methods:</b> AF patients initiating anticoagulation between 2013-2019 were identified in Belgian nationwide data. Inverse probability of treatment weighted Cox regression was used to investigate effectiveness and safety outcomes and were additionally stratified by NOAC dose. <b>Results:</b> Among 254,478 AF patients (328,796 person-years of follow-up), NOACs were associated with significantly lower risks of stroke or systemic embolism (stroke/SE) (hazard ratio (HR) 0.68, 95% confidence interval (CI) (0.64-0.72)), all-cause mortality (HR 0.76, 95%CI (0.74-0.79)), major or clinically relevant non-major bleeding (MB/CRNMB) (HR 0.94, 95%CI (0.91-0.98)) and intracranial hemorrhage (HR 0.73, 95%CI (0.66-0.79)), but non-significantly different risks of myocardial infarction, gastrointestinal and urogenital bleeding compared to VKAs. Despite similar stroke/SE risks, dabigatran and apixaban were associated with significantly lower MB/CRNMB risks compared to rivaroxaban (HR 0.86, 95%CI (0.83-0.90); HR 0.86, 95%CI (0.83-0.89), respectively) and edoxaban (HR 0.91, 95%CI (0.83-0.99); HR 0.86, 95%CI (0.81-0.91), respectively), and apixaban with significantly lower major bleeding risks compared to dabigatran (HR 0.86, 95%CI (0.80-0.92)) and edoxaban (HR 0.79, 95%CI (0.72-0.86)). However, higher mortality risks were observed in some risk groups including with apixaban in patients with diabetes or concomitantly using digoxin compared to dabigatran and edoxaban, respectively. <b>Conclusion:</b> NOACs had better long-term risk-benefit profiles than VKAs. While effectiveness was comparable, apixaban was overall associated with a more favorable safety profile followed by dabigatran.","['NOAC', 'VKA', 'anticoagulant', 'atrial fibrillation', 'bleeding', 'mortality', 'myocardial infarction', 'thromboembolism']"
Activation of autonomic thermoeffectors preceding the decision to behaviourally thermoregulate in resting humans.,"What is the central question of this study? Do increases in metabolic heat production and sweat rate precede the initiation of thermoregulatory behaviour in resting humans exposed to cool and warm environments? What is the main finding and its importance? Thermoregulatory behaviour at rest in cool and warm environments is preceded by changes in vasomotor tone in glabrous and non-glabrous skin, but not by acute increases in metabolic heat production or sweat rate. These findings suggest that sweating and shivering are not obligatory for thermal behaviour to be initiated in humans. We tested the hypothesis that acute increases in metabolic heat production and sweating precede the initiation of thermoregulatory behaviour in resting humans exposed to cool and warm environments. Twelve healthy young subjects passively moved between 17 and 40°C rooms when they felt 'too cool' (C→W) or 'too warm' (W→C). Skin and internal (intestinal) temperatures, metabolic heat production, local sweat rate (forearm and chest) and cutaneous vascular conductance (CVC; forearm and fingertip) were measured continually. Compared with pretest baseline (31.8 ± 0.3°C), skin temperature was higher at C→W (32.0 ± 0.7°C; P = 0.01) and W→C (34.5 ± 0.5°C; P < 0.01). Internal temperature did not differ (P = 0.12) between baseline (37.2 ± 0.3°C), C→W (37.2 ± 0.3°C) and W→C (37.0 ± 0.3°C). Metabolic heat production was not different from baseline (40 ± 9 W m<sup>-2</sup> ) at C→W (39 ± 7 W m<sup>-2</sup> ; P = 0.50). Forearm (0.06 ± 0.01 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>  min<sup>-1</sup> ) and chest (0.04 ± 0.02 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>  min<sup>-1</sup> ) sweat rate at W→C did not differ from baseline (forearm, 0.05 ± 0.02 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>  min<sup>-1</sup> and chest, 0.04 ± 0.02 mg cm<sup>-2</sup>  min<sup>-1</sup> ; P ≥ 0.23). Forearm CVC was not different from baseline (0.30 ± 0.21 perfusion units (PU) mmHg<sup>-1</sup> ) at C→W (0.24 ± 0.11 PU mmHg<sup>-1</sup> ; P = 0.17), but was higher at W→C (0.65 ± 0.33 PU mmHg<sup>-1</sup> ; P < 0.01). Fingertip CVC was different from baseline (2.6 ± 2.0 PU mmHg<sup>-1</sup> ) at C→W (0.70 ± 0.42 PU mmHg<sup>-1</sup> ; P < 0.01) and W→C (4.49 ± 1.66 PU mmHg<sup>-1</sup> ; P < 0.01). Thermoregulatory behaviour at rest in cool and warm environments is preceded by changes in vasomotor tone in glabrous and non-glabrous skin, but not by acute increases in metabolic heat production or sweat rate.","['cutaneous vascular conductance', 'metabolic heat production', 'skin blood flow', 'sweat rate', 'thermal discomfort', 'thermoregulatory behavior']"
Fluticasone furoate/Vilanterol 92/22 μg once-a-day vs Beclomethasone dipropionate/Formoterol 100/6 μg b.I.D.: a 12-month comparison of outcomes in mild-to-moderate asthma.,"Bronchial asthma is an inflammatory disease of the airways. Beclomethasone dipropionate/Formoterol (BDP/F) and Fluticasone furoate/Vilanterol (FF/V) are two of the most effective LABA/ICS combinations for managing persistent bronchial asthma. Aim of the study was to compare the outcomes achieved in mild-to-moderate asthma patients assuming BDP/F 100/6 μg b.i.d. (Group A) or FF/V 92/22 μg once-daily (Group B) for 12-months. No head-to-head long-term comparison is available at present.Data were automatically and anonymously obtained from the institutional database: FEV<sub>1</sub>% predicted values; the exacerbation and hospitalization rates; days of hospitalization; GP and/or specialist visits; days of inactivity; courses of systemic steroids and/or antibiotics were recorded at baseline and after 3, 6 and 12 months of both treatments. The overall adherence to treatments was also calculated. The propensity score method was used for matching and comparing the two cohorts of patients; Anova and Wilcoxon tests were used for checking the trends and time-to-time comparisons over the period; statistical significance was accepted for <i>p</i> < 0.05.The PS-matching process returned a cohort of 40 group A patients matched with 40 patients of group B, fully comparable for demographics, clinical characteristics, and comorbidities. The improvement in lung function was significant in both groups (<i>p</i> < 0.001), even if it was significantly higher and time-dependent in group B. The mean (±SE) exacerbation rate/patient changed from 0.63 (±0.13) at baseline to 0.53 (±0.12) after three; to 0.58 (±0.13) after six, and to 0.60 (±0.18) after twelve months in group A (p = ns), while from of 1.05 (±0.16) at baseline, to 0.28 (±0.07) after three; to 0.33 (±0.08) after six, and to 0.18 (±0.08) after twelve months in group B (<i>p</i> < 0.001), respectively. The mean hospitalization rate/patient changed from 0.25 ± 0.07 at baseline to 0.15 (±0.06) after three; to 0.08 (±0.04) after six, and to 0.13 (±0.05) after twelve months in group A (p = ns), while from 0.30 (±0.07) at baseline to 0.08 (±0.04) after three; to 0.10 (±0.05) after six, and to 0.03 (±0.03) after twelve months in group B (<i>p</i> < 0.001), respectively. Also mean duration of hospitalization and days of inactivity were in favour of FF/V treatment over time (in both cases <i>p</i> < 0.001). GP's visits were reduced by both treatments (<i>p</i> < 0.007 in group A and p < 0.001 in group B, respectively, while Specialist's visits only dropped during FF/V (<i>p</i> < 0.001). Steroid and antibiotic courses were significantly reduced by both treatments, even if more systematically in group B (p < 0.001 vs <i>p</i> < 0.007, and p < 0.001 vs <i>p</i> < 0.044, respectively). Moreover, changes in all outcomes considered proved time-dependent during the FF/V treatment only, particularly over the second semester. Finally, the overtime adherence to treatment was higher by 22 days during FF/V .Both the ICS/LABA combinations proved effective, even if characterized by different patterns of effectiveness either in terms of lung function and of long-term clinical outcomes. Only the once-daily inhalation of combined FF/V 92/22 μg once-daily optimized systematically the exacerbation and hospitalization rates in mild-to-moderate asthma, together with all other outcomes over time. The effectiveness of FF/V 92/22 once-daily μg proved progressive and time-dependent over the twelve-month period of the study, and associated to a higher adherence to treatment.","['Adherence to treatment', 'Beclomethasone dipropionateFormoterol', 'Clinical outcomes', 'Fluticasone furoateVilanterol', 'Mildtomoderate asthma', 'Time dependency', 'Twelvemonth survey']"
Evaluating the Correlation of Bariatric Surgery and the Prevalence of Cancers in Obese Patients: A Study of the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) Database.,"Purpose Obesity is a global pandemic that exerts a significant burden on healthcare worldwide. Multiple cancers, as well as deaths from the same, are more prevalent in obese patients. Bariatric surgery has been shown to be the most effective way of treating obesity once other measures have been exhausted. There is no concordant data available to support that bariatric surgery can reduce the prevalence of cancer. Using one of the largest data samples, we evaluate the correlation of bariatric surgery in morbidly obese patients with the prevalence of obesity-related cancers (breast, endometrial, esophageal, colorectal, prostate, and renal) in morbidly obese patients. Patients and methods A sample of 7,672,508 morbidly obese patients was identified from the 1994 to 2004 records of the National Inpatient Sample (NIS) database, divided into those who did and did not undergo bariatric surgery, and studied for the prevalence of obesity-associated cancers. Results Obesity was predominantly seen in the Caucasian population (68.22%). The mean age of cases who underwent bariatric surgery was younger when compared to those who did not undergo the procedure (43.89±25.16 vs. 54.90±36.40, p-value <0.0001). The highest bariatric surgery rate was seen in the Northeast (5.57%), followed by the West (4.15%), South (3.02%), and Midwest (2.96%) (p-value <0.0001). Overall, the odds of morbidly obese patients who underwent bariatric surgery and developed cancer are: esophageal cancer 0.19 (0.1218-0.3078, p <0.0001), colorectal cancer 0.0368 (0.0275- 0.0493, p <0.0001), endometrial cancer 0.0155 (0.0099-0.0244, p <0.0001), breast cancer 0.0712 (0.0582-0.0871, p <0.0001), prostate cancer 0.0285 (0.0199-0.0408, p <0.0001) and renal cancer 0.0182 (0.0106-0.0314, p <0.0001). The odds of cancer post-bariatric surgery remained significantly lower even after matching certain confounding factors. Conclusions The odds of developing breast, esophageal, prostate, renal, and colorectal cancers are significantly lower in morbidly obese patients who undergo bariatric surgery.","['bariatric surgery', 'breast cancer', 'colorectal cancer', 'esophageal cancer', 'gastric cancer', 'obesity', 'obesity related cancers', 'prostate cancer', 'rcc', 'renal cell cancer']"
Need for Palliative Care in Patient with Rheumatoid Arthritis: A Cross-sectional Observational Study.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic disorder causing inflammation in the joints and achieving remission is often the primary goal of physicians. We evaluated the suffering from RA and assessed the need for palliative care services in these patients.This cross-sectional observational study was done in 100 adult RA cases who attended the outpatient department. The Disease Activity Score 28 (DAS28), Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index, depression, anxiety and stress score, Short Form 36 Health Survey and numeric rating scale were assessed. The relationship between DAS28 with the other parameters and scores was assessed using Spearman's rho correlation coefficient.About 90% of patients in our study were female and majority (50%) had a moderate disease activity. The DAS28 showed a positive correlation with the degree of depression (r = 0.671, <i>P</i> = 0.000), anxiety (r = 0.609, <i>P</i> = 0.000) and stress levels (r = 0.474, <i>P</i> = 0.000). The patients with severe disease had a poor quality of life (QoL) [physical functioning (r = -0.737, <i>P</i> = 0.000); role limitation (r = -0.662, <i>P</i> = 0.000); emotional problem (r = -0.676, <i>P</i> = 0.000); energy/fatigue (r = -0.638, <i>P</i> = 0.000); social functioning (r = -0.658, <i>P</i> = 0.000); emotional well-being (r = -0.605, <i>P</i> = 0.000); general health (r = -0.643, <i>P</i> = 0.000); health change (r = -0.376, <i>P</i> = 0.000) and numerical rating scale score for pain (r = 0.656, <i>P</i> = 0.000)].RA patients with high disease activity suffer from depression, anxiety, stress and poor QoL. Palliative care physicians and rheumatologists must be vested with the power to provide comprehensive care to these patients.","['Anxiety', 'Palliative care', 'Quality of life', 'Rheumatoid arthritis', 'Stress']"
Radiomics Analysis of Multi-Sequence MR Images For Predicting Microsatellite Instability Status Preoperatively in Rectal Cancer.,"Immunotherapy, adjuvant chemotherapy, and prognosis of colorectal cancer are associated with MSI. Biopsy pathology cannot fully reflect the MSI status and heterogeneity of rectal cancer.To develop a radiomic-based model to preoperatively predict MSI status in rectal cancer on MRI.The patients were divided into two cohorts (training and testing) at a 7:3 ratio. Radiomics features, including intensity, texture, and shape, were extracted from the segmented volumes of interest based on T2-weighted and ADC imaging.Independent sample t test, Mann-Whitney test, the chi-squared test, Receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, decision curve analysis and multi-variate logistic regression analysis.The radiomics models were significantly associated with MSI status. The T2-based model showed an area under the curve of 0.870 with 95% CI: 0.794-0.945 (accuracy, 0.845; specificity, 0.714; sensitivity, 0.976) in training set and 0.895 with 95% CI, 0.777-1.000 (accuracy, 0.778; specificity, 0.887; sensitivity, 0.772) in testing set. The ADC-based model had an AUC of 0.790 with 95% CI: 0.794-0.945 (accuracy, 0.774; specificity, 0.714; sensitivity, 0.976) in training set and 0.796 with 95% CI, 0.777-1.000 (accuracy, 0.778; specificity, 0.889; sensitivity, 0.772) in testing set. The combined model integrating T2 and ADC features showed an AUC of 0.908 with 95% CI: 0.845-0.971 (accuracy, 0.857; specificity, 0.762; sensitivity, 0.952) in training set and 0.926 with 95% CI: 0.813-1.000 (accuracy, 0.852; specificity, 1.000; sensitivity, 0.778) in testing set. Calibration curve showed that the combined score had a good calibration degree, and the decision curve demonstrated that the combined score was of benefit for clinical use.Radiomics analysis of T2W and ADC images showed significant relevance in the prediction of microsatellite status, and the accuracy of combined model of ADC and T2W features was better than either alone.","['magnetic resonance', 'microsatellite instability', 'multisequence MR', 'radiomics', 'rectal cancer']"
Efficacy of Alpha-lipoic Acid in The Management of Diabetes Mellitus: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) is a naturally-occurring compound that has shown promising antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in experimental and human studies. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of ALA in the management of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM). We searched Medline (via PubMed), EBSCO, Scopus, and Web of Science for relevant randomized controlled trials. Data on glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), blood glucose levels, lipid profile components, HOMA, and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) were extracted and pooled as the standardized mean difference (SMD) in a random effect model meta-analysis using RevMan version 5.3. Ten studies (n = 553 patients) were included. In the term of HBA1C, the overall SMD did not favor either of the two groups (SMD = 0.01, 95% CI [-0.32,0.35]; <i>p</i> = 0.94) in uncomplicated T2DM patients. Moreover, there was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of FBG (SMD = -0.06, 95% CI [-0.44,0.33]; <i>p</i> = 0.78), PPBG (SMD = 0.04, 95% CI [-0.27,0.34]; <i>p</i> = 0.82), HDL (SMD = -0.05, 95% CI [-0.35,0.25]; <i>p</i> = 0.75), LDL (SMD = -0.05, 95% CI [-0.33,0.23]; <i>p</i> = 0.75). In terms of GPx, ALA was superior to placebo (SMD = 0.43, 95% CI [0.07,0.8]; <i>p</i> = 0.02). Our analysis showed that ALA was not superior to placebo in terms of HBA1C, LDL, HDL, TC, TG reduction in uncomplicated T2DM. However, in terms of GPx, ALA was significantly superior to the placebo. Further studies with larger sample sizes should investigate different doses of ALA in DM patients.","['Alphalipoic acid', 'Diabetes Mellitus', 'Metaanalysis', 'Metabolic Diseases', 'Thioctic Acid']"
Correlation between human detection accuracy and observer model-based image quality metrics in computed tomography.,"The purpose of this study was to compare computed tomography (CT) low-contrast detectability from human readers with observer model-based surrogates of image quality. A phantom with a range of low-contrast signals (five contrasts, three sizes) was imaged on a state-of-the-art CT scanner (Siemens' force). Images were reconstructed using filtered back projection and advanced modeled iterative reconstruction and were assessed by 11 readers using a two alternative forced choice method. Concurrently, contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR), area-weighted CNR (CNRA), and observer model-based metrics were estimated, including nonprewhitening (NPW) matched filter, NPW with eye filter (NPWE), NPW with internal noise, NPW with an eye filter and internal noise (NPWEi), channelized Hotelling observer (CHO), and CHO with internal noise (CHOi). The correlation coefficients (Pearson and Spearman), linear discriminator error, [Formula: see text], and magnitude of confidence intervals, [Formula: see text], were used to determine correlation, proper characterization of the reconstruction algorithms, and model precision, respectively. Pearson (Spearman) correlation was 0.36 (0.33), 0.83 (0.84), 0.84 (0.86), 0.86 (0.88), 0.86 (0.91), 0.88 (0.90), 0.85 (0.89), and 0.87 (0.84), [Formula: see text] was 0.25, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.25, 0.4, and 0.45, and [Formula: see text] was [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] for CNR, CNRA, NPW, NPWE, NPWi, NPWEi, CHO, and CHOi, respectively.","['computed tomography', 'detectability', 'image quality', 'observer models']"
Genetic parameters of egg quality traits in long-term pedigree recorded Japanese quail.,"This study was conducted to determine the genetic parameters of internal and external quality traits of Japanese quail eggs. Two statistical models were used in the calculation of genetic parameters and variance components. While 286 eggs were used based on model 1, 1,524 eggs were used based on model 2. Genetic parameters of the first eggs were calculated with direct genetic effect included in the analysis as random factors by using model 1. Model 2 was used for all eggs (5 to 6 eggs from each hen for six rearing groups). As different from model 1, their permanent environmental effects were also included in the model 2. Heritability of egg weight, egg length, egg width, shape index, shell weight, shell thickness, and shell ratio among the external quality traits of the eggs was respectively found to be 0.44, 0.53, 0.51, 0.70, 0.19, 0.16, and 0.05, respectively, according to model 1. These values were found to be 0.46, 0.40, 0.74, 0.48, 0.60, 0.28, and 0.21, respectively, according to model 2. Yolk weight, yolk diameter, yolk height, yolk index, yolk ratio, albumen weight, albumen height, albumen ratio, and Haugh unit values among the internal quality traits of the egg were found to be 0.22, 0.32, 0.02, 0.16, 0.19, 0.34, 0.19, 0.17, and 0.17, respectively, according to model 1. These internal quality traits were found to be 0.27, 0.18, 0.38, 0.06, 0.20, 0.41, 0.15, 0.15, and 0.12, respectively, according to model 2. Consequently, in this study, strong genetic correlations were detected between albumen height and Haugh unit, and also between albumen height and albumen weight. Additionally, a high and positive correlation was observed between some yolk traits (yolk weight and diameter) and albumen traits (weight and height). All these genetic correlations can be used to improve egg quality with a selection according to albumen weight.","['Japanese quail', 'egg quality traits', 'genetic parameter']"
Decision-tree early warning score (DTEWS) validates the design of the National Early Warning Score (NEWS).,"To compare the performance of a human-generated, trial and error-optimised early warning score (EWS), i.e., National Early Warning Score (NEWS), with one generated entirely algorithmically using Decision Tree (DT) analysis.We used DT analysis to construct a decision-tree EWS (DTEWS) from a database of 198,755 vital signs observation sets collected from 35,585 consecutive, completed acute medical admissions. We evaluated the ability of DTEWS to discriminate patients at risk of cardiac arrest, unanticipated intensive care unit admission or death, each within 24h of a given vital signs observation. We compared the performance of DTEWS and NEWS using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic (AUROC) curve.The structures of DTEWS and NEWS were very similar. The AUROC (95% CI) for DTEWS for cardiac arrest, unanticipated ICU admission, death, and any of the outcomes, all within 24h, were 0.708 (0.669-0.747), 0.862 (0.852-0.872), 0.899 (0.892-0.907), and 0.877 (0.870-0.883), respectively. Values for NEWS were 0.722 (0.685-0.759) [cardiac arrest], 0.857 (0.847-0.868) [unanticipated ICU admission}, 0.894 (0.887-0.902) [death], and 0.873 (0.866-0.879) [any outcome].The decision-tree technique independently validates the composition and weightings of NEWS. The DT approach quickly provided an almost identical EWS to NEWS, although one that admittedly would benefit from fine-tuning using clinical knowledge. We believe that DT analysis could be used to quickly develop candidate models for disease-specific EWSs, which may be required in future.","['Early warning scores', 'Medical emergency team', 'Outreach', 'Risk prediction', 'Scoring systems', 'Track and trigger systems']"
Laser acupuncture and photobiomodulation therapy in Bell's palsy with a duration of greater than 8 weeks: a randomized controlled trial.,"To investigate the efficacy of laser acupuncture and photobiomodulation therapy in alleviating symptoms among patients diagnosed with Bell's palsy with duration of greater than 8 weeks. The randomized controlled trial has been performed from May 2021 to April 2023. Patients were eligible who had Bell's palsy with duration of greater than 8 weeks on out-patient Department of Otorhinolaryngology in Beijing Tongren Hospital. The laser acupuncture group received class IV laser treatment for 3 times per weeks, a total of 72 times. The control group received the same treatment procedure except the laser parameter. The primary outcome measures comprised House-Brackmann facial nerve grading system and electroneurography. Secondary outcome measures comprised Sunnybrook facial grading system, electromyography, and the blink reflex. A total of 84 participants were included (42 control group, 42 laser acupuncture group). After treatment, House-Brackmann facial nerve grading system (OR, 0.11; 95% CI, 0.04-0.30; P < 0.001), and the pathologic numbers of electroneuronography were statistically different between the laser acupuncture group and control group, including orbicularis oculi (OR,0.08; 95% CI, 0.02-0.21; P < 0.001), Frontalis muscle (OR,0.14; 95% CI, 0.05-0.39; P < 0.001), Orbicularis oris (OR,0.13; 95% CI, 0.04-0.36; P < 0.001), Ala nasi muscle (OR,0.06; 95% CI, 0.02-0.18; P < 0.001). In secondary outcomes, Sunnybrook facial grading system, has significant difference between the two groups (20.26; 95% CI, 14.69 to 25.83; P < 0.01). Latency by ENoG, include orbicularis oculi (-0.61; 95% CI, -0.43 to -0.09; P < 0.001), frontalis muscle (-0.12; 95% CI, -0.21 to -0.03; P < 0.01), orbicularis oris (-0.28; 95% CI, -0.41 to -0.16; P < 0.001), and ala nasi muscle (-0.26; 95% CI, -0.38 to -0.16; P < 0.001). All amplitudes of MUAPs and durations by electromyography (EMG) showed statistically significant differences compared with the control group after treatment. For the frontalis muscle, the amplitude of MUAPs was -64.23 (95% CI, -80.89 to -47.56; P < 0.001) and duration was -1.18 (95% CI, -1.49 to -0.87; P < 0.001). For orbicularis oris, amplitude of MUAPs was -29.82 (95% CI, -55.03 to -4.62; P = 0.02) and duration was -0.57 (95% CI, -0.94 to -0.20; P < 0.001). For depressor angulli oris, amplitude of MUAPs was -47.06 (95% CI, -62.15 to -31.97; P < 0.001) and duration was -2.21 (95% CI, -2.69 to -1.72; P < 0.001). Blink reflex, including R1 (OR, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01-0.16; P < .001), R2 (OR, 0.04; 95% CI, 0.004-0.29; P < .001), and R2 latency differences (OR, 0.15; 95% CI, 0.05-0.51; P < .001), have significant difference between the two groups, respectively.

Long-Term Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Patients with Moderate and Severe COVID-19: A Focus on Early Statin Use and Previous CVD.,"Limited data exist regarding the status of long-term cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes of hospitalized COVID-19 patients. We aimed to examine the efficacy of early statin use after SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and the impact of prior CVD on the incidence of cardiovascular events.A prospective cohort study was performed on hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) as a composite of cardiovascular mortality, stroke, heart failure, venous thromboembolism (VTE), revascularization, and nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI). The secondary endpoints comprised MACE components, all-cause mortality, readmission for COVID-19, and impaired functional classes.The mean age of the 858 participants was 55.52±13.97 years, and the median follow-up time was 13 months (11.5-15). Men comprised 63.9% of the patients. Overall, MACE occurred in 84 subjects (9.8%), and 98 patients (11.4%) received ventilation. A multivariate Cox regression model was employed to explore the association between statin use and outcomes, and the following hazard ratios were obtained: MACE (0.831 [0.529 to 0.981]; P=0.044), All-cause mortality (1.098 [0.935 to 1.294]; P=0.255), stroke (0.118 [0.029 to 0.48]; P=0.003), revascularization (0.103 [0.029 to 0.367]; P<0.0001), poor functional capacity (0.827 [0.673 to 1.018]; P=0.073), nonfatal MI (0.599 [0.257 to 1.394]; P=0.234), VTE (0.376 [0.119 to 1.190]; P=0.096), and decompensated heart failure (0.137 [0.040 to 0.472]; P=0.002). Prior CVD predicted MACE (2.953 [1.393 to 6.271]; P=0.005), all-cause death (1.170 [0.960 to 1.412]; P=0.102), and VTE (2.770 [0.957 to 8.955]; P=0.051).Previous CVD is a robust predictor of long-term MACE and VTE. Early statin use might decrease the incidence rates of MACE, ischemic stroke, revascularization, and readmission for heart failure.","['COVID19', 'Cardiovascular disease', 'Long term adverse effects', 'Mortality', 'Statin', 'Survival']"
Assessment of resting myocardial blood flow in regions of known transmural scar to confirm accuracy and precision of 3D cardiac positron emission tomography.,"Composite invasive and non-invasive data consistently demonstrate that resting myocardial blood flow (rMBF) in regions of known transmural myocardial scar (TMS) converge on a value of ~ 0.30 mL/min/g or lower. This value has been confirmed using the 3 most common myocardial perfusion agents (<sup>13</sup>N, <sup>15</sup>O-H<sub>2</sub>O and <sup>82</sup>Rb) incorporating various kinetic models on older 2D positron emission tomography (PET) systems. Thus, rMBF in regions of TMS can serve as a reference ""truth"" to evaluate low-end accuracy of various PET systems and software packages (SWPs). Using <sup>82</sup>Rb on a contemporary 3D-PET-CT system, we sought to determine whether currently available SWP can accurately and precisely measure rMBF in regions of known TMS.Median rMBF (in mL/min/g) and COV in regions of TMS were 0.71 [IQR 0.52-1.02] and 0.16 with 4DM; 0.41 [0.34-0.54] and 0.10 with 4DM-FVD; 0.66 [0.51-0.85] and 0.11 with Cedars; 0.51 [0.43-0.61] and 0.08 with Emory-Votaw; 0.37 [0.30-0.42], 0.07 with Emory-Ottawa, and 0.26 [0.23-0.32], COV 0.07 with HeartSee.SWPs varied widely in low end accuracy based on measurement of rMBF in regions of known TMS. 3D PET using <sup>82</sup>Rb and HeartSee software accurately (0.26 mL/min/g, consistent with established values) and precisely (COV = 0.07) quantified rMBF in regions of TMS. The Emory-Ottawa software yielded the next-best accuracy (0.37 mL/min/g), though rMBF was higher than established gold-standard values in ~ 5% of the resting scans. 4DM, 4DM-FDV, Cedars and Emory-Votaw SWP consistently resulted values higher than the established gold standard (0.71, 0.41, 0.66, 0.51 mL/min/g, respectively), with higher interscan variability (0.16, 0.11, 0.11, and 0.09, respectively).clinicaltrial.gov, NCT05286593, Registered December 28, 2021, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05286593 .","['Myocardial scar', 'Positron emission tomography PET', 'Resting myocardial blood flow']"
Efficacy and safety of whole-body vibration therapy for post-stroke spasticity: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"One of the main objectives of stroke rehabilitation is to alleviate post-stroke spasticity. Over the recent years, many studies have explored the potential benefits of whole-body vibration (WBV) treatment for post-stroke spasticity, but it is still controversial.The current study aims to assess the efficacy and safety of WBV for post-stroke spasticity and determine the appropriate application situation.From their establishment until August 2022, the following databases were searched: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Medline, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were published in either English or Chinese were taken into consideration. We independently filtered the research, gathered the data from the studies, and evaluated the research quality (Cochrane RoB tool) and the overall evidence quality (GRADE). Rev Man 5.4 software was utilized to conduct statistical analysis.In this analysis, 11 RCTs with 475 patients that reported on the effectiveness of WBV therapy for post-stroke spasticity were taken into account. Compared to the control groups, the results revealed that WBV combined with conventional rehabilitation at a vibration frequency lower than 20 Hz (SMD = -0.58, 95% CI: -0.98 to -0.19, <i>P</i> = 0.004) was more effective in relieving upper (SMD = -0.53, 95% CI: -1.04 to 0.03, <i>P</i> = 0.03) and lower limb spasticity (SMD = -0.21, 95% CI: -0.40 to -0.01, <i>P</i> = 0.04); similarly, it was superior for patients aged under 60 years (SMD = -0.41, 95% CI: -0.66 to -0.17, <i>P</i> = 0.0008) with acute and subacute stroke (SMD = -0.39, 95% CI: -0.68 to -0.09, <i>P</i> = 0.01). The valid vibration for reducing spasticity was found to last for 10 min (SMD = -0.41, 95% CI: -0.75 to -0.07, <i>P</i> = 0.02). None of the included studies revealed any serious adverse impact.Moderate-quality evidence demonstrated when WBV was used as an adjuvant, vibration <20 Hz for 10 min was effective and secure in treating upper and lower limb spasticity in patients with acute and subacute stroke under the age of 60 years.https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/, identifier: CRD42022293951.","['metaanalysis', 'muscle spasticity', 'rehabilitation', 'stroke', 'whole body vibration therapy']"
Agreement between Capillary Refill Time measured at Finger and Earlobe sites in different positions: a pilot prospective study on healthy volunteers.,"Capillary Refill Time (CRT) is a marker of peripheral perfusion usually performed at fingertip; however, its evaluation at other sites/position may be advantageous. Moreover, arm position during CRT assessment has not been fully standardized.We performed a pilot prospective observational study in 82 healthy volunteers. CRT was assessed: a) in standard position with participants in semi-recumbent position; b) at 30° forearm elevation, c and d) at earlobe site in semi-recumbent and supine position. Bland-Altman analysis was performed to calculate bias and limits of agreement (LoA). Correlation was investigated with Pearson test.Standard finger CRT values (1.04 s [0.80;1.39]) were similar to the earlobe semi-recumbent ones (1.10 s [0.90;1.26]; p = 0.52), with Bias 0.02 ± 0.18 s (LoA -0.33;0.37); correlation was weak but significant (r = 0.28 [0.7;0.47]; p = 0.01). Conversely, standard finger CRT was significantly longer than earlobe supine CRT (0.88 s [0.75;1.06]; p < 0.001) with Bias 0.22 ± 0.4 s (LoA -0.56;1.0), and no correlation (r = 0,12 [-0,09;0,33]; p = 0.27]. As compared with standard finger CRT, measurement with 30° forearm elevation was significantly longer (1.17 s [0.93;1.41] p = 0.03), with Bias -0.07 ± 0.3 s (LoA -0.61;0.47) and with a significant correlation of moderate degree (r = 0.67 [0.53;0.77]; p < 0.001).In healthy volunteers, the elevation of the forearm significantly prolongs CRT values. CRT measured at the earlobe in semi-recumbent position may represent a valid surrogate when access to the finger is not feasible, whilst earlobe CRT measured in supine position yields different results. Research is needed in critically ill patients to evaluate accuracy and precision at different sites/positions.","['Accuracy', 'Critical illness', 'Hemodynamics', 'Intensive care', 'Perfusion', 'Precision']"
Genetic analysis of production traits and body size measurements and their relationships with metabolic diseases in German Holstein cattle.,"This study sheds light on the genetic complexity and interplay of production, body size, and metabolic health in dairy cattle. Phenotypes for body size-related traits from conformation classification (130,166 animals) and production (101,562 animals) of primiparous German Holstein cows were available. Additionally, 21,992, 16,641, and 7,096 animals were from herds with recordings of the metabolic diseases ketosis, displaced abomasum, and milk fever in first, second, and third lactation. Moreover, all animals were genotyped. Heritabilities of traits and genetic correlations between all traits were estimated and GWAS were performed. Heritability was between 0.240 and 0.333 for production and between 0.149 and 0.368 for body size traits. Metabolic diseases were lowly heritable, with estimates ranging from 0.011 to 0.029 in primiparous cows, from 0.008 to 0.031 in second lactation, and from 0.037 to 0.052 in third lactation. Production was found to have negative genetic correlations with body condition score (BCS; -0.279 to -0.343) and udder depth (-0.348 to -0.419). Positive correlations were observed for production and body depth (0.138-0.228), dairy character (DCH) (0.334-0.422), and stature (STAT) (0.084-0.158). In first parity cows, metabolic disease traits were unfavorably correlated with production, with genetic correlations varying from 0.111 to 0.224, implying that higher yielding cows have more metabolic problems. Genetic correlations of disease traits in second and third lactation with production in primiparous cows were low to moderate and in most cases unfavorable. While BCS was negatively correlated with metabolic diseases (-0.255 to -0.470), positive correlations were found between disease traits and DCH (0.269-0.469) as well as STAT (0.172-0.242). Thus, the results indicate that larger and sharper animals with low BCS are more susceptible to metabolic disorders. Genome-wide association studies revealed several significantly associated SNPs for production and conformation traits, confirming previous findings from literature. Moreover, for production and conformation traits, shared significant signals on Bos taurus autosome (BTA) 5 (88.36 Mb) and BTA 6 (86.40 to 87.27 Mb) were found, implying pleiotropy. Additionally, significant SNPs were observed for metabolic diseases on BTA 3, 10, 14, 17, and 26 in first lactation and on BTA 2, 6, 8, 17, and 23 in third lactation. Overall, this study provides important insights into the genetic basis and interrelations of relevant traits in today's Holstein cattle breeding programs, and findings may help to improve selection decisions.","['body size', 'conformation traits', 'genetic correlation', 'metabolic disease']"
Early NIV is associated with accelerated lung function decline in Duchenne muscular dystrophy treated with glucocorticosteroids.,"Use of non-invasive ventilation (NIV) in adolescents with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) has increased with concomitant extended survival.To describe lung function (LF) changes with NIV in adolescents with DMD and to assess differences between <i>Steroid Users</i> and <i>Steroid Naïve</i> subjects.A retrospective cohort of adolescents with DMD initiating NIV over 10 years was conducted. Serial LF before and after NIV initiation was collated. Use of systemic glucocorticosteroids, adherence to NIV and presence of cardiac disease were assessed.Twenty-nine men started NIV, median age 14.66 years (IQR 2.35, 10.47-17.96). Nine were <i>Steroid Users</i> and eight were <i>Steroid Naïve</i>. Indications for NIV were apnoea-hypopnoea index >5 and/or nocturnal hypoventilation. LF is better (forced vital capacity (FVC) z-score -3.26 vs -5.41, p < 0.02) and decline slower (FVC z-score -0.58 per annum (pa) vs -0.68 pa, p<0.001) in <i>Steroid Users</i> compared with <i>Steroid Naïve</i> subjects. Following NIV initiation, FVC z-score decline slowed for the whole (-0.72 pa (95% CI -0.79 to 0.64) to -0.46 pa (95% CI -0.54 to 0.38) p < 0.001) and <i>Steroid Naïve</i> groups (-0.74 (95% CI -0.85 to 0.63) to -0.44 pa (95% CI -0.56 to 0.32) p < 0.001) but accelerated in the <i>Steroid User</i> group (-0.56 (95% CI -0.70 to 0.42) to -0.75 pa (95% CI -0.89 to 0.61) p < 0.001). Adherence to NIV and cardiac disease did not impact decline.Overall, LF decline is reduced on NIV. <i>Steroid Naïve</i> patients have lower LF and faster decline, which slows following NIV initiation. An accelerated LF decline was seen on NIV in <i>Steroid Users</i> which requires further prospective research.","['non invasive ventilation', 'paediatric physician', 'respiratory muscles', 'sleep apnoea']"
Genetic variation and forensic efficiency of 30 indels for three ethnic groups in Guangxi: relationships with other populations.,"In this study, we used a series of diallelic genetic marker insertion/deletion polymorphism (indel) to investigate three populations of Yao, Kelao, and Zhuang groups in the Guangxi region of China and to evaluate their efficiency in forensic application.No deviations for all 30 loci were observed from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium after Bonferroni correction (<i>p</i> > 0.05/30 = 0.0017). The allele frequencies of the short allele (DIP-) for the above three populations were in the range of 0.0520-0.9480, 0.0950-0.8780, and 0.0850-0.915, respectively. The observed heterozygosity of the 30 loci for the three populations was in the ranges 0.0802-0.5802, 0.1908-0.6053, and 0.1400-0.5600, respectively. The cumulative power of exclusion and combined discrimination power for Yao, Kelao, and Zhuang groups were (0.9843 and 0.9999999999433), (0.9972 and 0.9999999999184), and (0.9845 and 0.9999999999608), respectively. The DA distance, principal component analysis, and cluster analysis indicated a clear regional distribution. In addition, Zhuang groups had close genetic relationships with the Yao and Kelao populations in the Guangxi region.This study indicated that the 30 loci were qualified for personal identification; moreover, they could be used as complementary genetic markers for paternity testing in forensic cases for the studied populations.","['DIPplex', 'Forensic genetics', 'Guangxi', 'Insertiondeletion', 'Kelao', 'Yao', 'Zhuang']"
The Efficacy of SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination in the Elderly: A Systemic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Given the reduced immune response to vaccines in older populations, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccinations and its impact on breakthrough infection, hospital admission, and mortality in the elderly.We carried out a systemic review and meta-analysis where MEDLINE, Web of Science, EMBASE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and Cochrane Central Register for Controlled Trials were queried to identify relevant literature. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs), non-randomized trials, prospective, observational cohort, and case-control studies assessing breakthrough infection, hospital admission, and mortality after coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination in the elderly (≥ 60 years old).Overall, 26 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with the unvaccinated group, the vaccinated group showed a decreased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection after 28-34 (relative risk [RR] = 0.42, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.37-0.49) and 35-60 days (RR = 0.49, 95% CI 0.37-0.62). There was a step-wise increase in efficacy with additional doses with the two-dose group experiencing decreased risk of breakthrough infection (RR = 0.37, 95% CI 0.32-0.42), hospital admissions (RR = 0.25, 95% CI 0.14-0.45), disease severity (RR = 0.38, 95% CI 0.20-0.70), and mortality (RR = 0.21, 95% CI 0.14-0.32) compared with those receiving one or no doses. Similarly three-dose and four-dose vaccine groups also showed a decreased risk of breakthrough infection (3-dose: RR = 0.14, 95% CI 0.10-0.20; 4-dose RR = 0.46, 95% CI 0.4-0.53), hospital admissions (3-dose: RR = 0.11, 95% CI 0.07-0.17; 4-dose: RR = 0.42, 95% CI 0.32-0.55), and all-cause mortality (3-dose: RR = 0.10, 95% CI 0.02-0.48; 4-dose: RR = 0.48, 95% CI 0.28-0.84) Subgroup analysis found that protection against mortality for vaccinated vs. unvaccinated groups was similar by age (60-79 years: RR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.47-0.74; ≥ 80 years: RR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59-0.98) and gender (female: RR = 0.66; 95% CI, 0.50-0.87, male: (RR = 0.58; 95% CI, 0.44-0.76), and comorbid cardiovascular disease (CVD) (RR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.52-0.92) or diabetes (DM) (RR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.39-0.89.Our pooled results showed that SARS-CoV-2 vaccines administered to the elderly is effective in preventing prevent breakthrough infection, hospitalization, severity, and death. What's more, increasing number of vaccine doses is becoming increasingly effective.","['Breakthrough infection', 'Hospital admission', 'Metaanalysis', 'Mortality', 'Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 SARSCoV2', 'The elderly']"
Is goal-directed fluid therapy based on dynamic variables alone sufficient to improve clinical outcomes among patients undergoing surgery? A meta-analysis.,"Whether goal-directed fluid therapy based on dynamic predictors of fluid responsiveness (GDFTdyn) alone improves clinical outcomes in comparison with standard fluid therapy among patients undergoing surgery remains unclear.PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for relevant studies. Studies comparing the effects of GDFTdyn with that of standard fluid therapy on clinical outcomes among adult patients undergoing surgery were considered eligible. Two analyses were performed separately: GDFTdyn alone versus standard fluid therapy and GDFTdyn with other optimization goals versus standard fluid therapy. The primary outcomes were short-term mortality and overall morbidity, while the secondary outcomes were serum lactate concentration, organ-specific morbidity, and length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU) and in hospital.We included 37 studies with 2910 patients. Although GDFTdyn alone lowered serum lactate concentration (mean difference (MD) - 0.21 mmol/L, 95% confidence interval (CI) (- 0.39, - 0.03), P = 0.02), no significant difference was found between groups in short-term mortality (odds ratio (OR) 0.85, 95% CI (0.32, 2.24), P = 0.74), overall morbidity (OR 1.03, 95% CI (0.31, 3.37), P = 0.97), organ-specific morbidity, or length of stay in the ICU and in hospital. Analysis of trials involving the combination of GDFTdyn and other optimization goals (mainly cardiac output (CO) or cardiac index (CIx)) showed a significant reduction in short-term mortality (OR 0.45, 95% CI (0.24, 0.85), P = 0.01), overall morbidity (OR 0.41, 95% CI (0.28, 0.58), P < 0.00001), serum lactate concentration (MD - 0.60 mmol/L, 95% CI (- 1.04, - 0.15), P = 0.009), cardiopulmonary complications (cardiac arrhythmia (OR 0.58, 95% CI (0.37, 0.92), P = 0.02), myocardial infarction (OR 0.35, 95% CI (0.16, 0.76), P = 0.008), heart failure/cardiovascular dysfunction (OR 0.31, 95% CI (0.14, 0.67), P = 0.003), acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (OR 0.13, 95% CI (0.02, 0.74), P = 0.02), pneumonia (OR 0.4, 95% CI (0.24, 0.65), P = 0.0002)), length of stay in the ICU (MD - 0.77 days, 95% CI (- 1.07, - 0.46), P < 0.00001) and in hospital (MD - 1.18 days, 95% CI (- 1.90, - 0.46), P = 0.001).It was not the optimization of fluid responsiveness by GDFTdyn alone but rather the optimization of tissue and organ perfusion by GDFTdyn and other optimization goals that benefited patients undergoing surgery. Patients managed with the combination of GDFTdyn and CO/CI goals might derive most benefit.","['Cardiac output', 'Dynamic variables', 'Goaldirected fluid therapy', 'Surgery']"
Association of haemoglobin glycation index with outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome: results from an observational cohort study in China.,"The hemoglobin glycation index (HGI) is the difference between measured and estimated glycation of hemoglobin. However, there is limited evidence to investigate the HGI and the clinical outcomes of acute coronary syndrome patients. This study aimed to evaluate the association between HGI and the clinical outcomes of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in a China cohort.This single-center retrospective study was carried out in the Cardiovascular Center of Beijing Friendship Hospital, a total of 11004 consecutive patients with ACS from Dec 2012-Dec 2020 were enrolled in this study. Patients were divided into quintiles according to their HGI levels. The incidence of major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs) was recorded.HGI were divided into five quintiles quintiles: -0.906 (-7.188, -0.663), -0.491 (-0.663, -0.343), -0.196 (-0.342, -0.039), 0.170 (-0.039, 0.485), and 1.156 (0.485, 7.875), respectively. Competing risk regression revealed that HGI was positively related to all-cause death, CV death, and composite MACCEs. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis indicated that hypertension (HR:1.109, P = 0.013), previous stroke (HR:1.208, P < 0.001), past PCI (HR: 1.268, P < 0.001), age (HR: 1.011, P < 0.001), BMI (HR: 0.987, P = 0.012), heart rate (HR: 1.004, P = 0.001), NSTEMI (HR: 1.205, P < 0.001), WBC (HR: 1.020, P = 0.008), eGFR (HR: 0.993, P < 0.001), HDL-C (HR: 0.809, P = 0.002), LVEF (HR:0.240, P < 0.001), LM/three-vessel or proximal LAD involved (HR: 1.208 P < 0.001; HR:0.914, P = 0.019, respectively), and antiplatelet agents during hospitalization (HR:0.806, P = 0.020) independently predicted the incidence of MACCEs in ACS patients. Restricted cubic spline indicated a U-shaped association between the HGI and risk of MACCEs.Both low HGI and high HGI was associated with an increased risk of adverse outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome, compared with moderate HGI.","['Acute coronary syndrome', 'China', 'Hemoglobin glycation index', 'Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events']"
"Dietary effects on breast cancer molecular subtypes, a 1:2 paired case-control study.","To explore the associations between dietary factors and breast cancer (BC) molecular subtypes. The retrospective cases were confirmed by pathological diagnosis with breast cancer were gathered in two major hospitals in Xuzhou city, China, from 2015 to 2016. These cases were classified by the meeting standard of 13th St Gallen: luminal A, luminal B, Her-2 overexpression, and triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) subtypes. A 1:2 paired retrospective case-control study with 210 cases and 420 controls was conducted to evaluate individual dietary intake, by food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and estimate odds ratios (<i>OR</i>s), by the Cox regression model. For overall breast cancer patients, the more frequency of red meat (<i>OR</i> = 1.002, <i>95% CI</i> = 1.001-1.004) and salted food (<i>OR</i> = 1.003, <i>95% CI</i> = 1.001-1.005) were statistically significantly associated with a greater risk of breast cancer.

For luminal breast cancer patients, beans (<i>OR</i> = 0.997, <i>95% CI</i> = 0.994-0.999), white meat (<i>OR</i> = 0.992, <i>95% CI</i> = 0.987-0.997), green tea (<i>OR</i> = 0.995, <i>95% CI</i> = 0.991-0.999), and milk (<i>OR</i> = 0.998, <i>95% CI</i> = 0.996-0.999) were protective factors. While for nonluminal breast cancer, red meat was not included in the equation, and beans (<i>OR</i> = 0.989, <i>95% CI</i> = 0.981-0.997), white meat (<i>OR</i> = 0.989, <i>95% CI</i> = 0.981-0.998), vegetables (<i>OR</i> = 0.998, <i>95% CI</i> = 0.997-0.999), and milk (<i>OR</i> = 0.994, <i>95% CI</i> = 0.989-0.999) still showed a significantly reduced risk of nonluminal breast cancer. Different dietary factors revealed different effects on the etiology of breast cancer. Red meat may be a specific risk factor for luminal-type breast cancer.","['breast cancer', 'case–control study', 'dietary factor', 'molecular subtypes']"
The Polish Version of the Alberta Infant Motor Scale: Cultural Adaptation and Validation.,"The Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) is a diagnostic tool for the assessment of the motor performance of infants from the time of birth, to the period of independent walking (0-18 months). This study aims to derive a Polish version of the AIMS through its cultural adaptation and validation. The study included 145 infants aged 0-18 months, who were divided into four further age groups: 0-3 months, 4-7 months, 8-11 months, and older than 12 months. The validation was based on an analysis of intrarater and interrater reliability values, as well as concurrent validity, using the gross motor scale of Peabody Developmental Motor Scales-2 (PDMS-2). The total Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) for intrarater reliability was 0.99 (ICC range in positions was 0.87-0.99, in subgroups was 0.91-0.99), while in particular positions, the ICC ranges were as follows: prone 0.97-0.99, supine 0.94-0.99, sitting 0.95-0.99, and standing: 0.63-0.99. The total ICC for interrater reliability was 0.99 (ICC range in positions was 0.98-0.99, in subgroups was 0.91-0.99), while in particular positions, the ICC ranges were as follows: prone 0.95-0.99, supine 0.93-0.96, sitting 0.93-0.98, standing 0.91-0.98. Only the standing position was analyzed for the subgroup of participants over 12 months old. The Spearman correlation between the Polish version of the AIMS and the gross motor scale of PDMS-2 was significant in the total population (r = 0.97, <i>p</i> < 0.0001) and in subgroups (r = 0.79-0.85, <i>p</i> < 0.0001). The results of our study confirm that the Polish version of the AIMS is reliable for infants aged 0-18 months and can be applied to this population for clinical and scientific purposes.ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT05264064, URL https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ct2/show/NCT05264064.","['Alberta Infant Motor Scale', 'infant', 'motor development', 'reliability', 'validation']"
Early Protein Intake Influences Neonatal Brain Measurements in Preterms: An Observational Study.,"<b>Introduction:</b> To limit extrauterine growth restriction, recent guidelines on nutrition of preterm neonates recommended high protein intake since the first day of life (DOL). The impact of this nutritional strategy on the brain is still controversial. We aimed to evaluate the effects of protein intake on early cerebral growth in very low birth weight newborns. <b>Materials and Methods:</b> We performed serial cranial ultrasound (cUS) scans at 3-7 DOL and at 28 DOL in very low birth weight newborns consecutively observed in the neonatal intensive care unit. We analyzed the relation between protein intake and cerebral measurements at 28 DOL performed by cUS. <b>Results:</b> We enrolled 100 newborns (gestational age 29 ± 2 weeks, birth weight 1,274 ± 363 g). A significant (<i>p</i> < 0.05) positive correlation between enteral protein intake and biparietal diameter (<i>r</i> = 0.490<sup>**</sup>), occipital-frontal diameter (<i>r</i> = 0.608<sup>**</sup>), corpus callosum (length <i>r</i> = 0.293<sup>*</sup>, genu <i>r</i> = 0.301<sup>*</sup>), caudate head (right <i>r</i> = 0.528<sup>**</sup>, left <i>r</i> = 0.364<sup>**</sup>), and cerebellum (transverse diameter <i>r</i> = 0.440<sup>**</sup>, vermis height <i>r</i> = 0.356<sup>**</sup>, vermis width <i>r</i> = 0.377<sup>**</sup>) was observed at 28 DOL. Conversely, we found a significant negative correlation of protein intake given by parenteral nutrition (PN) with biparietal diameter (<i>r</i> = -0.524<sup>**</sup>), occipital-frontal diameter (<i>r</i> = -0.568<sup>**</sup>), body of corpus callosum (<i>r</i> = -0.276<sup>*</sup>), caudate head (right <i>r</i> = -0.613<sup>**</sup>, left <i>r</i> = -0.444<sup>**</sup>), and cerebellum (transverse diameter <i>r</i> = -0.403<sup>**</sup>, vermis height <i>r</i> = -0.274<sup>*</sup>, vermis width <i>r</i> = -0.462<sup>**</sup>) at 28 DOL. Multivariate regression analysis showed that measurements of occipital-frontal diameter, caudate head, and cerebellar vermis at 28 DOL depend positively on protein enteral intake (<i>r</i> = 0.402<sup>*</sup>, <i>r</i> = 0.305<sup>*</sup>, and <i>r</i> = 0.271<sup>*</sup>) and negatively by protein parenteral intake (<i>r</i> = -0.278<sup>*</sup>, <i>r</i> = -0.488<sup>*</sup>, and <i>r</i> = -0.342<sup>*</sup>). <b>Conclusion:</b> Brain development in neonatal life depends on early protein intake. High protein intake affects cerebral structures' measurements of preterm newborn when administered by PN. Positive impact on brain development encourages the administration of recommended protein intake mainly by enteral nutrition.","['VLBW', 'aminoacids solution', 'cerebral growth', 'cranial ultrasound', 'enteral nutrition', 'newborn', 'nutrition', 'parenteral nutrition']"
Does Severity of Alzheimer's Disease Contribute to Its Responsiveness to Modifying Gut Microbiota? A Double Blind Clinical Trial.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with cognitive dysfunction. Evidence indicates that gut microbiota is altered in the AD and, hence, modifying the gut flora may affect the disease. In the previous clinical research we evaluated the effect of a probiotic combination on the cognitive abilities of AD patients. Since, in addition to pathological disorders, the AD is associated with changes in oxidant/antioxidant and inflammatory/anti-inflammatory biomarkers, the present work was designed to evaluate responsiveness of the inflammatory and oxidative biomarkers to the probiotic treatment. The control (CON) and probiotic (PRO) AD patients were treated for 12 weeks by the placebo and probiotic supplementation, respectively. The patients were cognitively assessed by Test Your Memory (TYM = 50 scores). Also serum concentrations of nitric oxide (NO), glutathione (GSH), total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), 8-hydroxy-2' -deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) and cytokines (TNF-a, IL-6, and IL-10) were measured. The cognitive test and the serum biomarkers were assessed pre- and post-treatment. According to TYM test 83.5% of the patients showed severe AD. The CON (12.86% ± 8.33) and PRO (-9.35% ± 16.83) groups not differently scored the cognitive test. Not pronounced change percent was found in the serum level of TNF-α (1.67% ± 1.33 vs. -0.15% ± 0.27), IL-6 (0.35% ± 0.17 vs. 2.18% ± 0.15), IL-10 (0.05% ± 0.10 vs. -0.70% ± 0.73), TAC (0.07% ± 0.07 and -0.06% ± 0.03), GSH (0.08% ± 0.05 and 0.04% ± 0.03) NO (0.11% ± 0.06 and 0.05% ± 0.09), MDA (-0.11% ± 0.03 and -0.17% ± 0.03), 8-OHdG (43.25% ± 3.01 and 42.70% ± 3.27) in the CON and PRO groups, respectively. We concluded that the cognitive and biochemical indications in the patients with severe AD are insensitive to the probiotic supplementation. Therefore, in addition to formulation and dosage of probiotic bacteria, severity of disease and time of administration deeply affects results of treatment.","['Alzheimers disease', 'cognition', 'inflammation', 'microbiota', 'oxidative stress', 'probiotics']"
A water additive with pomegranate can reduce dental plaque and calculus accumulation in dogs.,"Oral homecare plays a major part in dental disease prevention but it can be difficult to perform and time-consuming. Furthermore, the product used can be of limited efficiency. The goal of this study was to assess the efficacy of a water additive to limit the accumulation of plaque and calculus in dogs. Forty dogs were selected and randomly allocated to one of the two groups after scaling and polishing on day 0. The control group received no oral hygiene while the second group received the water additive (Vet Aquadent<sup>®</sup> FR3SH<sup>™</sup>, Virbac) every day. After 30 days, plaque and calculus accumulations were evaluated under anesthesia. The Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI) was assessed on days 0 and 30. On day 30, the plaque and calculus indices were significantly smaller (<i>p</i> < 0.05) in the Aquadent group compared to the control group with median (Q1-Q3) scores of 1.22 (0.99-1.44) <i>vs</i>. 2.31 (1.65-3.86), respectively for plaque and 0.25 (0.15-0.42) <i>vs</i>. 0.33 (0.32-0.69) for calculus. Between day 0 and day 30, the GBI significantly decreased in the control group [from 0.39 (0.21-0.56) to 0.19 (0.08-0.29)] and in the Aquadent group [from 0.33 (0.18-0.47) to 0.00 (0.00-0.00)] but the decrease was significantly greater in the Aquadent group. These results show for the first time that the water additive tested can reduce dental deposit accumulation in dogs and improve gingival health. It can be recommended after a dental cleaning, especially to owners who are reluctant to provide dental care at home due to a lack of time or convenience.","['Aquadent efficacy', 'dental homecare', 'dental plaque dog', 'limiting dental deposits', 'periodontal disease prevention', 'pomegranate efficacy', 'reducing gingivitis']"
"The effect of potassium lactate on the free amino acid composition, lipid oxidation, colour, microbiological, and sensory properties of ready-to-eat pastırma, a dry-cured and dried meat product.","In this study, the effects of potassium lactate (PL, Potassium-L-2-hydroxy-propionate, Potassium-L-Lactate) usage (0%, 0.5%, 1.0%, 2.0% PL of curing mixture) in addition to NaCl and sodium nitrite as curing agent on the physico-chemical, microbiological and sensory properties of ready-to-eat pastırma were investigated.

Impact of drug utilization management policy on prescription opioid use in Georgia Medicaid.,"To examine the effectiveness of changes in opioid prescription policies on opioid prescribing and health services utilization rates in Georgia Medicaid.This study used data from the Georgia Medicaid patient enrollment, medical and pharmacy claims database from 2009 to 2014.We performed an interrupted time series analysis to examine the effect of the policy changes. Outcome measures assessed the trends in the indicators of potential inappropriate prescribing practices, including overlapping prescriptions of opioid + opioid, opioid + benzodiazepine and opioids + buprenorphine/naloxone, as well as health services utilization, including hospitalization, mean length of stay, outpatient office and emergency room visits.A total of 712 342 opioid users aged 18-64 were included in the study. The policies were associated with significant decreasing trend of opioid + opioid (-0.0011; 95% CI = -0.0020, -0.0002) and opioid + benzodiazepines (-0.001; 95% CI = -0.0022, -0.0006) overlapping while associated with a significant immediate decrease in and opioids + buprenorphine/naloxone after the implementations (-0.0014; 95% CI = -0.0025, -0.0003). Significant immediate decrease in level of office visits and ER visits were seen with the policy implementation (office visit: -0.2939; 95% CI = -0.5528, -0.0350, ER visit: -0.0740, 95% CI = -0.1294, -0.0185). The policies were not shown to be significantly associated with hospitalization and the mean length of inpatient stay.Our analysis suggests that Georgia Medicaid opioid policies were useful to contain inappropriate opioid use.","['Georgia Medicaid', 'healthcare utilization', 'opioid', 'opioid prescribing']"
Long-Term Cognitive Performance of Retired Athletes with Sport-Related Concussion: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"<i>Objective:</i> The purpose of this systematic review is to quantitatively estimate (or invest) the impacts of sports-related concussions (SRCs) on cognitive performance among retired athletes more than 10 years after retirement. <i>Methods:</i> Six databases including (MEDLINE, Scopus, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, CINAHL, and PsycArtilces) were employed to retrieve the related studies. Studies that evaluate the association between cognitive function and the SRC of retired athletes sustaining more than 10 years were included. <i>Results:</i> A total of 11 studies that included 792 participants (534 retired athletes with SRC) were identified. The results indicated that the retired athletes with SRCs, compared to the non-concussion group, had significant cognitive deficits in verbal memory (SMD = -0.29, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.02, I<sup>2</sup> = 52.8%), delayed recall (SMD = -0.30, 95% CI -0.46 to 0.07, I<sup>2</sup> = 27.9%), and attention (SMD = -0.33, 95% CI -0.59 to -0.06, I<sup>2</sup> = 0%). Additionally, meta-regression demonstrated that the period of time between testing and the last concussion is significantly associated with reduced verbal memory (<i>β</i> = -0.03681, <i>p</i> = 0.03), and increasing age is significantly associated with the verbal memory (<i>β</i> = -0.03767, <i>p</i> = 0.01), immediate recall (<i>β</i> = -0.08684, <i>p</i> = 0.02), and delay recall (<i>β</i> = -0.07432, <i>p</i> = 0.02). <i>Conclusion:</i> The retired athletes who suffered from SRCs during their playing career had declined cognitive performance in partial domains (immediate recall, visuospatial ability, and reaction time) later in life.","['cognitive function', 'retired athletes', 'sportrelated concussion', 'synthesized analysis']"
Anthropometric indices added the predictive ability of iron status in prognosis of atherosclerosis.,"Abnormal homeostasis of iron such as deficiency or overload is associated with the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Another risk factor for CVD is obesity whose added predictive ability to iron status has been assessed by few study. This study aimed to eva¬luate the effect of adding anthropometric indices to a model based on iron status as risk factors of CVD.This cross-sectional study included 140 adult women aged 18-50 years randomly se-lected from Sheikhorrais Clinic that is one of the Tabriz University sub-specialized clinics in 2011. Anthropometric indices, carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT) and body iron status were measured by standard protocol, non-invasive ultrasound and concentrations of serum iron, ferri¬tin, TIBC (Total iron Binding Capacity) and complete blood cell counts (CBC), respectively. In¬tegrated discriminatory improvement index (IDI) and net reclassification improvement index (NRI) were used as the measures of added predictive ability of anthropometric measures to the iron statues.IDI (SE) after adding Waist Circumference (WC), Waist to Heap Ratio (WHR), Waist to Height Ratio (WHtR), Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body fat (%) to base model was 0.12 (0.028), 0.09 (0.026), 0.12 (0.028), 0.07 (0.022) and 0.10 (0.026) respectively. The NRI (SE) was 0.10 (0.065) for WC, 0.03 (0.058) for WHR, 0.07 (0.067) for WHtR, 0.05 (0.067) for BMI, and 0.08 (0.064) for Body fat.Anthropometric indices could significantly add to the predictive ability of the iron statues, with highest IDI when WC and WHtR were added to the base model. It suggests that by adding WC and WHtR to the iron status lead us to a more optimal model for predicting the ini¬tial stage of atherosclerosis.","['Anthropometric', 'Atherosclerosis', 'IDI', 'Iron', 'NRI', 'Predictive Ability']"
Mustard seed meal mixtures: management of Meloidogyne incognita on pepper and potential phytotoxicity.,"Meals produced when oil is extracted from seeds in the Brassicaceae have been shown to suppress weeds and soilborne pathogens. These seed meals are commonly used individually as soil amendments; the goal of this research was to evaluate seed meal mixes of Brassica juncea (Bj) and Sinapis alba (Sa) against Meloidogyne incognita. Seed meals from Bj 'Pacific Gold' and Sa 'IdaGold' were tested alone and in combinations to determine rates and application times that would suppress M. incognita on pepper (Capsicum annuum) without phytotoxicity. Rates of soil application (% w/w) for the phytotoxicity study were: 0.5 Sa, 0.2 Bj, 0.25 Sa + 0.25 Bj, 0.375 Sa + 0.125 Bj, 0.125 Sa + 0.375 Bj, and 0, applied 0 - 5 weeks before transplant. Overall, 0.2% Bj was the least toxic meal to pepper seedlings. By comparison, 0.5% S. alba seed meal did not reduce lettuce (Lactuca sativa) seed germination at week 0, but all seed meal treatments containing B. juncea prevented or significantly reduced germination at week 0. The seed meals did not affect lettuce seed germination at weeks 1-5, but hypocotyl growth was reduced by all except 0.2% Bj at weeks 1, 4 and 5. Brassica juncea and Sa meals were tested for M. incognita suppression at 0.2, 0.15, 0.1 and 0.05%; mixtures were 0.1% Sa + 0.1% Bj, 0.15% Sa + 0.05% Bj, and 0.05% Sa + 0.15% Bj. All treatments were applied 2 weeks before transplant. The 0.2% Bj and 0.05% Sa + 0.15% Bj treatments overall had the longest shoots and highest fresh weights. Eggs per g root were lowest with 0.1 - 0.2% Bj amendments and the seed meal mixtures. The results indicate that Bj and some Bj + Sa mixtures can be applied close to transplant to suppress M. incognita populations on pepper; consequently, a seed meal mixture could be selected to provide activity against more than one pest or pathogen. For pepper, care should be taken in formulating mixtures so that Sa rates are low compared to Bj.","['Brassica', 'Meloidogyne incognita', 'Sinapis', 'amendment', 'biofuel byproducts', 'glucosinolate', 'management', 'mustard seed meal', 'rootknot nematode']"
Time for bed: associations with cognitive performance in 7-year-old children: a longitudinal population-based study.,"Little is known about the links between the time that young children go to bed and their cognitive development. In this paper we seek to examine whether bedtimes in early childhood are related to cognitive test scores in 7-year-olds.We examined data on bedtimes and cognitive test (z-scores) for reading, maths and spatial abilities for 11 178 7-year-old children from the UK Millennium Cohort Study.At age 7, not having a regular bedtime was related to lower cognitive test scores in girls: reading (β: -0.22), maths (β: -0.26) and spatial (β: -0.15), but not for boys. Non-regular bedtimes at age 3 were independently associated, in girls and boys, with lower reading (β: -0.10, -0.20), maths (β: -0.16, -0.11) and spatial (β: -0.13, -0.16) scores. Cumulative relationships were apparent. Girls who never had regular bedtimes at ages 3, 5 and 7 had significantly lower reading (β: -0.36), maths (β: -0.51) and spatial (β: -0.40) scores, while for boys this was the case for those having non-regular bedtimes at any two ages (3, 5 or 7 years): reading (β: -0.28), maths (β: -0.22) and spatial (β: -0.26) scores. In boys having non-regular bedtimes at all three ages (3, 5 and 7 years) were non-significantly related to lower reading, maths and spatial scores.The consistent nature of bedtimes during early childhood is related to cognitive performance. Given the importance of early child development, there may be knock on effects for health throughout life.","['Cognition', 'Epidemiology', 'Sleep']"
"Efficacy and Safety of Linagliptin in 2681 Asian Patients Stratified by Age, Obesity, and Renal Function: A Pooled Analysis of Randomized Clinical Trials.","Asian patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) are younger, leaner, and more likely to develop renal dysfunction than White populations. In this multiethnic analysis of data from phase 3 trials, we investigated the efficacy and safety of the dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor linagliptin in Asians stratified by these subphenotypes.Data from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating linagliptin (as monotherapy, add-on therapy to metformin ± sulfonylurea, combined with pioglitazone or added to insulin) were pooled with efficacy data from 11 randomized trials of at least 24 weeks and safety data from 15 trials of various durations.In the efficacy set, 1404 Asian patients received linagliptin [mean (standard deviation) age 54.5 (10.1) years; body mass index (BMI) 26.0 (3.9) kg/m<sup>2</sup>] and 661 received placebo [age 55.0 (9.7) years; BMI 26.1 (3.9) kg/m<sup>2</sup>] with the same glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c): 8.2 (0.9)% in both groups. At 24 weeks, the placebo-corrected adjusted mean ± standard error change from baseline in HbA1c with linagliptin was -0.73 ± 0.04% (95% confidence interval -0.81, -0.65; P < 0.0001).

In the safety set (linagliptin, n = 1842; placebo, n = 839), 52.2% and 54.6% of patients, respectively, experienced adverse events. The rates of drug-related adverse events were 10.9% in the linagliptin group and 10.4% in the placebo group. The respective rates of hypoglycemia were 8.3% and 9.5%, mainly among patients treated with sulfonylurea or insulin. Severe hypoglycemia was rare (<1.0% in either group).Linagliptin effectively reduced hyperglycemia in Asian patients with uncontrolled T2D, irrespective of age, BMI, renal function, or ethnic subgroups, and was well tolerated.Boehringer Ingelheim, Eli Lilly and Company, and the Diabetes Alliance.","['Asian patients', 'Data pooling', 'Efficacy', 'Ethnic groups', 'Linagliptin', 'Safety', 'Type 2 diabetes']"
Relationships between athletic ability and academic performance in primary school students: A 3-year follow-up study.,"The aim of this study was to examine whether academic performance is associated with students' athletic ability in primary school.A 3-year follow-up study was conducted among 1,136 Chinese students. Sit-up and jump rope testers were used to measure 1-min sit-ups and 1-min jump ropes, respectively. Meanwhile, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Scale and the Beck Depression Inventory were used to estimate sleep quality and depression levels. The end-of-semester examinations were used to evaluate students' academic performance during the follow-up period.After adjusting for confounders, the mean change in Chinese language performance for participants stratified by 1-min sit-ups at baseline was 0.35 (95% CI: -0.37 to 0.76) for level 1 (slowest), 0.52 (95% CI: -0.54 to 1.08) for level 2, and 1.72 (95% CI: 1.14 to 2.30) for level 3 (fastest) (<i>P</i> for trend = 0.003); the mean change in math scores was 0.28 (95% CI: -0.50 to 0.95) for level 1 (slowest), 0.95 (95% CI: 0.38 to 1.52) for level 2, and 1.41 (95% CI: 0.82 to 1.99) for level 3 (fastest) (<i>P</i> for trend = 0.048). The mean change in foreign language scores was -0.45 (95% CI: -0.99 to -0.93) for level 1 (slowest), -0.14 (95% CI: -0.44 to 0.41) for level 2, and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.25 to 1.13) for level 3 (fastest) (<i>P</i> for trend = 0.004). The mean change in Chinese language performance for participants stratified by 1-min jump ropes at the baseline was 0.30 (95% CI: -0.16 to 0.76) for level 1 (slowest), 1.09 (95% CI: 0.42 to 1.76) for level 2, and 1.74 (95% CI: 1.14 to 2.35) for level 3 (fastest) (<i>P</i> for trend = 0.001).

Effect of arotinolol on chronic heart failure: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Heart failure is the end stage of all cardiovascular diseases, which brings a heavy burden to the global health network. Arotinolol, as a new type of β Receptor blocker, has a good antihypertensive effect. Many clinical trials have observed the clinical efficacy of arotinolol in the treatment of essential hypertension. However, so far, there has been no systematic evaluation on the efficacy and safety of arotinolol in the treatment of chronic heart failure.The purpose of this review was to systematically evaluate the clinical efficacy of arotinolol in patients with chronic heart failure.Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of arotinolol in the treatment of chronic heart failure were retrieved from seven databases according to the Cochrane manual, including CNKI (China National Knowledge Infrastructure), Wan fang database, VIP database, PubMed, Sinomed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library databases. The main outcomes were the effective rate, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), blood pressure, heart rate, cardiac index, stroke volume (SV), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), hypersensitive C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP), left ventricular end diastolic volume (LVEDV), left ventricular end diastolic diameter (LVEDD), and adverse events (AEs).A total of 17 trials met the qualification criteria, which included 1,717 patients with heart failure. Most trials had uncertain risks in terms of random sequence generation, allocation hiding, patient loss, and result evaluation. Meta analysis showed that arotinolol significantly improved the treatment efficiency of patients with heart failure (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 4.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) [2.89, 5.72], <i>p</i> = 0.00, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0), LVEF (SMD = 1.59, 95% CI [0.99, 2.19], <i>p</i> = 0.000 0, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 95.8%), cardiac index (SMD = 0.32, 95% CI [0.11, 0.53], <i>p</i> = 0.03), <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0), SV (SMD = 2.00, 95% CI [1.57, 2.34], <i>p</i> = 0.000, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 64.2%), lower BNP (SMD = -0.804, 95% CI [-0.97, -0.64], <i>p</i> = 0.000, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 94.4%), and LVEDV (SMD = -0.25, 95% CI [-0.45, -0.05], <i>p</i> = 0.015, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0). There was no statistical significance for blood pressure (SMD<sub>systolic pressure</sub> = -0.09, 95% CI [-0.69, 0.51], <i>p</i> = 0.775, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> <sub>systolic pressure</sub> = 90.2%; SMD<sub>diastolic pressure</sub> = -0.16, 95% CI [-0.79, 0.48], <i>P</i> = 0.632, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> <sub>diastolic pressure</sub> = 91.2%), heart rate (SMD = -0.12, 95% CI [-1.00, 0.75], <i>P</i> = 0.787, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 96.1%), Hs-CRP (SMD = -1.52, 95% CI [-3.43, 0.40], <i>P</i> = 0.121, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 98.3%), and LVEDD (SMD = -0.07, 95% CI [-0.90, 0.76], <i>P</i> = 0.870, <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 96.5%).Arotinolol can safely and effectively improve the effective rate of patients with chronic heart failure, increase LVEF, increase CI and SV, and reduce BNP and LVEDV. However, because of the low overall quality of the included randomized controlled trials, these findings need to be considered carefully. More high-quality randomized controlled trials are needed for further verification, to provide a more scientific basis for the safety and effectiveness of arotinolol in the clinical treatment of heart failure.[https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/display_record.php?RecordID=371214], identifier [CRD:420223371214].","['arotinolol', 'cardiac insufficiency', 'heart failure', 'metaanalysis', 'randomized controlled trial', 'systematic evaluation']"
"Association of serum leptin and adiponectin with anthropomorphic indices of obesity, blood lipids and insulin resistance in a Sub-Saharan African population.","There is little data on the metabolic effects of adipokines in sub-Saharan African populations. This study aimed to explore the potential relationship of leptin and adiponectin, with obesity, plasma lipids and insulin resistance in a Cameroonian population.We enrolled 167 men and 309 women aged ≥18 years from the general population in Cameroon. Data were collected on waist circumference (WC), body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body fat (BF%), fasting blood glucose, plasma lipids, adiponectin, leptin, insulin and homeostasis model for assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Pearson's correlation and multiple stepwise linear regression analyses were used to determine correlates of leptin and adiponectin serum levels.The prevalence of obesity was higher in women compared to men (p < 0.0001), and Central obesity which is more prevalent particularly in women (WC = 42.4%, WHR = 42.3%), is almost for 90% comparable to %BF (42.7%). Adiponectin negatively with BMI (r = -0.294, p < 0.0001), WC (r = -0.294, p < 0.0001), %BF (r = -0.122, p = 0.028), WHR (r = -0.143, p = 0.009), triglycerides (r = -0.141, p = 0.011), HOMA-IR (r = -0.145, p = 0.027) and insulin (r = -0.130, p = 0.048). Leptin positively correlated with BMI (r = 0.628), WC (r = 0.530), BF% (r = 0.720), (all p < 0.0001); with DBP (r = 0.112, p = 0.043), total cholesterol (r = 0.324, p < 0.0001), LDL-cholesterol (r = 0.298, p < 0.0001), insulin (r = 0.320, p < 0.001 and HOMA-IR (r = 0.272, p < 0.0001). In multiple stepwise regression analysis, adiponectin was negatively associated with WC (β = -0.38, p = 0.001) and BF% (β = 0.33, p < 0.0001), while leptin was positively associated with BF% (β = 0.60, p < 0.0001), total cholesterol (β = 0.11, p = 0.02) and HOMA-IR (β = 0.11, p = 0.02). When controlled for gender, HOMA-IR was found significantly associated to adiponectin (β = 0.13, p = 0.046), but not BF%, while the association previously found between leptin and HOMA-IR disappeared; BMI and WC were significantly associated with leptin (β = 0.18, p = 0.04 & β = 0.19, p = 0.02 respectively).This study, which includes a population who was not receiving potentially confounding medications, confirms the associations previously observed of adiponectin with reduced adiposity especially central adiposity and improved insulin sensitivity. Confirmatory associations were also observed between leptin and obesity, blood lipids and insulin resistance for the first time in an African population. Gender was significant covariate interacting with insulin sensitivity/insulin resistance and obesity indexes associations in this population.","['Adipokines', 'Adiponectin', 'Blood lipids', 'Insulin resistance', 'Insulin sensitivity', 'Leptin', 'Obesity indices']"
Understanding Crystal Cleavability and Physical Properties of Crystal Surfaces Using in Silico Simulation.,"In the drug formulation process, compound dissolution rate and wettability may be improved by grinding. However, there is no method to understand the effects of the wettability of the crystal facets of the ground product. Here, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) was used to evaluate the changes in crystal morphology and dissolution rate by jet milling using powder X-ray diffraction and in silico simulation. Several cleavage facets were observed in cube crystals, and the (0 0 2) facet was observed in plate crystals. Furthermore, the dissolution rate of the ground samples per unit area decreased with the cleavage of the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) facets. The polar surface energy of the ground sample decreased with increasing grinding pressure. The simulation results showed that the absolute attachment energy of the (1 0 0) and (0 0 2) facets was lower than that of the other crystal facets. Moreover, atoms with low polarity were present on the crystal surface of (0 0 2). The wettability and dissolution rate of the (0 0 2) facet were worse than those of the (1 0 0) facet. It was suggested that the dissolution rate of the ground sample was affected by the wettability of the crystal facet caused by the cleavage. The cleavability and wettability may be understood by simulation.","['acetylsalicylic acid', 'cleavage', 'crystal facet', 'in silico simulation', 'wettability']"

Associations between genomic merit for daughter pregnancy rate of Holstein cows and metabolites postpartum and estrus characteristics.,"Genetic selection of Holstein cattle in the past 2 decades has seen an increased attention to fertility traits. Our hypotheses were that genomic merit for daughter pregnancy rate (GDPR) is positively associated with metabolic responses, hazard of estrus, and estrus characteristics. Pregnant heifers (n = 821) from one herd that were genotyped within 2 mo of birth (Clarifide, Zoetis, Parsippany, NJ) were fitted with automated monitoring devices (SCR Inc., Netanya, Israel) -21 ± 14 d relative to calving. Estrus characteristics recorded from calving to 62 d postpartum were evaluated. Blood samples were collected weekly from a subsample (n = 499) of cows, from 7 to 28 d postpartum, for determination of insulin-like growth factor-1, glucose, and nonesterified fatty acids. Cows received artificial insemination or embryo transfer following detected estrus and those not detected in estrus were submitted to an ovulation synchronization protocol starting at 75 d in milk. Linear and quadratic associations between GDPR and outcomes were analyzed, but when appropriate, results are presented according to GDPR quartile (Q1 = -1.8 to 0.8; Q2 = 0.9 to 1.7; Q3 = 1.8 to 2.5; Q4 = 2.6 to 5.9) based on the parameter estimates of the multivariable models. Genomic merit for daughter pregnancy rate was positively associated with insulin-like growth factor-1 (Q1 = 24.3 ± 0.2; Q2 = 26.8 ± 0.2; Q3 = 28.2 ± 0.2; Q4 = 30.6 ± 0.3 ng/mL) and glucose (Q1 = 67.0 ± 0.1; Q2 = 69.1 ± 0.2; Q3 = 69.6 ± 0.2; Q4 = 70.8 ± 0.2 mg/dL) concentrations, but GDPR was negatively associated with nonesterified fatty acid concentration (Q1 = 281.2 ± 4.9; Q2 = 262.0 ± 5.9; Q3 = 239.3 ± 5.0; Q4 = 221.6 ± 4.7 μmol/L). A positive association was observed between GDPR and hazard of estrus [adjusted hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval = 1.16 (1.06, 1.28)] and number of estrus events (Q1 = 0.50 ± 0.03; Q2 = 0.62 ± 0.04; Q3 = 0.74 ± 0.05; Q4 = 0.86 ± 0.06) within 62 d postpartum, duration of estrus (Q1 = 14.10 ± 0.04; Q2 = 14.48 ± 0.04; Q3 = 14.67 ± 0.04; Q4 = 14.98 ± 0.04 h), probability of activity peak (0 = no estrus, 100 = maximum activity) ≥86 (Q1 = 0.80 ± 0.03; Q2 = 0.83 ± 0.02; Q3 = 0.83 ± 0.03; Q4 = 0.85 ± 0.2), and probability of heat index ≥86 (Q1 = 0.77 ± 0.04; Q2 = 0.81 ± 0.05; Q3 = 0.83 ± 0.03; Q4 = 0.86 ± 0.03). Conversely, GDPR was negatively associated with rumination nadir at estrus (Q1 = -35.5 ± 0.1; Q2 = -37.0 ± 0.1; Q3 = -38.0 ± 0.1; Q4 = -39.6 ± 0.1 min). We detected a positive association between GDPR and hazard of pregnancy (adjusted hazard ratio = 1.11, 95% confidence interval = 1.03, 1.19). Selection for GDPR may improve the hormonal and metabolic status of cows postpartum, leading to earlier resumption of cyclicity, and may improve detection of estrus in commercial herds because it was positively associated with estrus characteristics.","['Holstein', 'daughter pregnancy rate', 'estrus behavior', 'genomic merit']"
"Accelerometer-based osteogenic indices, moderate-to-vigorous and vigorous physical activity, and bone traits in adolescents.","We investigated the associations of accelerometry-derived osteogenic indices (OIs), moderate-to-vigorous (MVPA), and vigorous intensity physical activity (VPA) with peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pCQT) parameters in 99 adolescents aged 10-13 years.Bone parameters were assessed at the distal (4%) and shaft (66%) of the tibia using pQCT. Accelerometers were worn on the right hip for 7 consecutive days. OIs were calculated based on acceleration peak histograms either using all of the peaks (OI) or peaks with acceleration ≥5.2 g (HOI). MVPA and VPA were defined using previously published cut-points.HOI was positively associated with total area (Partial correlation= 0.22, 95% CI=0.01 to 0.41), cortical area (CoA) (0.33, 95% CI=0.13 to 0.50), and stress strain index (SSI) (0.29, 95% CI=0.09 to 0.47) of tibial shaft and with total density at the distal tibia (0.23, 95% CI=0.02 to 0.42). OI was positively associated with CoA (0.31, 95% CI=0.11 to 0.49) and SSI (0.26, 95% CI=0.05 to 0.44) of tibial shaft. MVPA was positively associated with CoA (0.28, 95% CI=0.07 to 0.46) of the tibial shaft.OI and HOI were positively associated with pQCT parameters while MVPA and VPA demonstrated less consistent associations with them.","['Accelerometer', 'Children', 'Exercise', 'Paediatric', 'Skeletal']"
Supervised Machine Learning Predictive Analytics For Triple-Negative Breast Cancer Death Outcomes.,"To use machine learning algorithms to predict the death outcomes of patients with triple-negative breast cancer, 5 years after discharge.1570 stage I-III breast cancer patients receiving treatment from Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital were analyzed. Machine learning was used to predict the death outcomes of patients with triple-negative breast cancer, 5 years after discharge.The results showed that platelets, LMR (lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio), age, PLR (the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio) and white blood cell counts accounted for a significant weight in the 5-year prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer patients. The results of model prediction indicated that rankings for accuracy among the training group (from high to low) were forest, gbm, and DecisionTree (0.770335, 0.760766, 0.751994, 0.737640 and 0.734450, respectively). For AUC value (high to low), they were forest, Logistic and DecisionTree (0.896673, 0.895408, 0.776836, 0.722799 and 0.702804, respectively). The highest MSE value for DecisionTree was 0.2656, and the lowest MSE value for forest was 0.2297. In the test group, accuracy rankings (from high to low) were DecisionTree, and GradientBoosting (0.748408, 0.738854, 0.738854, 0.732484 and gbm, respectively). For AUC value (high to low), the rankings were GradientBoosting, gbm, and DecisionTree (0.731595, 0.715438, 0.712767, 0.708348 and 0.691960, respectively). The maximum MSE value for gbm was 0.2707, and the minimum MSE value for DecisionTree was 0.2516.The machine learning algorithm can predict the death outcomes of patients with triple-negative breast cancer 5 years after discharge. This can be used to estimate individual outcomes for patients with triple-negative breast cancer.","['5year prognosis', 'machine learning', 'triplenegative breast cancer']"
"CETP polymorphisms confer genetic contribution to centenarians of Hainan, south of China.","In this paper, we will discuss if the CETP polymorphism contributes to the centenarians in Hainan island.We tested the TaqIB and I405V polymorphisms of CETP gene among 276 centenarians and 301 matched healthy individuals by AS-PCR and analyzed the data with SPSS software package (Version 19.0).Our data indicated that allele B1 and V have the significant differences between centenarians and healthy control groups with P < 0.001.

Craniofacial Resection for Sinonasal Malignant Tumors: Statistical Analysis of Surgical Outcome over 17 Years at a Single Institution.,"We present a retrospective analysis of surgical outcome of sinonasal malignant tumors. Overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival (DSS), local control (LC), and disease-free survival (DFS) were calculated in 32 patients. Prognostic factors for survival and functional outcomes were investigated. The median follow-up period was 70 months. At 5 years, OS, DSS, LC, and DFS rates were 0.722, 0.745, 0.851, and 0.707, respectively. Prognostic factors for poor OS were involvement of the frontal sinus (p = 0.023), T classification (T4, p = 0.025), surgical complications (p = 0.029), chemotherapy (p = 0.035) postsurgical infection (p = 0.043), involvement of the orbit (p = 0.048), histology (squamous cell carcinoma, p = 0.049), and radiotherapy (p = 0.043). Prognostic factors for poor DSS were radiotherapy (p = 0.030), chemotherapy (p = 0.036), positive surgical margin (p = 0.034), and T classification (T4, p = 0.050). LC was adversely influenced by surgical procedure (combined frontotemporal resection, p = 0.035) and positive surgical margin (p = 0.049). DFS was adversely influenced by positive surgical margin (p = 0.001). Prognostic factors for poor functional outcome were postsurgical infection (p = 0.039), postsurgical complications (p = 0.040), tumor location (maxillary sinus, p = 0.042, orbit, p = 0.0002), number of sinuses involved (number of sinuses involved was inversely proportional to functional outcome, p = 0.027), T classification (T4 p = 0.007), pathology (squamous cell carcinoma, p = 0.023), and chemotherapy (p = 0.048). Craniofacial resection was an effective surgical option.","['Sinonasal malignant tumor', 'craniofacial resection', 'functional outcome', 'statistical analysis', 'survival outcome']"
"Cirrhosis, Age, and Liver Stiffness-Based Models Predict Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Asian Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B.","Predicting hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis B who received long-term therapy with potent nucleos(t)ide analogs is of utmost importance to refine the strategy for HCC surveillance.We conducted a multicenter retrospective cohort study to validate the CAGE-B and SAGE-B scores, HCC prediction models developed for Caucasian patients receiving entecavir (ETV) or tenofovir (TFV) for >5 years. Consecutive patients who started ETV or TFV at two hospitals in Korea from January 2009 to December 2015 were identified. The prediction scores were calculated, and model performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves.Among 1557 patients included, 57 (3.7%) patients had HCC during a median follow-up of 93 (95% confidence interval, 73-119) months. In the entire cohort, CAGE-B predicted HCC with an area under the ROC curve of 0.78 (95% CI, 0.72-0.84). Models that have ""liver cirrhosis"" in the calculation, such as AASL (0.79 (0.72-0.85)), CU-HCC (0.77 (0.72-0.82)), and GAG-HCC (0.79 (0.74-0.85)), showed accuracy similar to that of CAGE-B (<i>p</i> > 0.05); however, models without ""liver cirrhosis"", including SAGE-B (0.71 (0.65-0.78)), showed a lower predictive ability than CAGE-B. CAGE-B performed well in subgroups of patients treated without treatment modification (0.81 (0.73-0.88)) and of male sex (0.79 (0.71-0.86)).This study validated the clinical usefulness of the CAGE-B score in a large number of Asian patients treated with long-term ETV or TFV. The results could provide the basis for the reappraisal of HCC surveillance strategies and encourage future prospective validation studies with liver stiffness measurements.","['CAGEB', 'SAGEB', 'hepatocellular carcinoma', 'prediction', 'validation']"
Item-level and Composite-level Interrater Reliability of Functional Movement Screen™ Scores Following Condensed Training in Novice Raters.,"The Functional Movement Screen™ (FMS™) is a clinical instrument designed to use movement behaviors to screen individuals for injury risk. Current rater certification programs focus on extensive, individualized training, which may not be appropriate in all screening contexts.The purpose of this research was to examine the effect of a two-hour FMS<sup>TM</sup> training seminar on measures of reliability between previously untrained scorers.Repeated measures, descriptive cohort study.Four novice raters completed a two-hour training course administered by an FMS™-certified, licensed physical therapist. The novices and the instructor then scored a group of 16 individuals on the seven FMS™ component tests on two separate occasions. Interrater reliability was assessed for FMS™ component scores using Fleiss' kappa and Krippendorff's α. Interrater reliability for the FMS™ composite score was assessed using a two-way ICC for agreement (a priori significance level=0.05).Reliability ranged from fair to almost perfect (kappa) for Deep Squat (0.61 Day 1, 0.79 Day 2), Shoulder Mobility (0.90 Day 1, 1.00 Day 2), Active Straight Leg Raise (0.53 Day 1, 0.69 Day 2), and Trunk Stability Push Up (0.48 Day 1, 0.49 Day 2) on both testing occurrences (p<0.05). Reliability (kappa) was fair for Inline Lunge (0.24 Day 1, 0.39 Day 2), and poor for Hurdle Step (Day 1 -0.01, Day 2 no result) and Rotary Stability (Day 1 -0.03, Day 2 -0.01). Results for Krippendorff's α were similar, with unacceptable interrater reliability for Hurdle Step (Day 1 -0.01, Day 2 1.00), Inline Lunge (Day 1 0.31, Day 2 0.39), and Rotary Stability (Day 1 -0.02, Day 2 -0.01). Interrater composite score reliability (ICC) was good (0.79 Day 1, 0.84 Day 2; both p<0.05).Findings suggest that a brief training seminar may be sufficient to ensure acceptable reliability in many, but not all, of the FMS™ component tests and composite score.Level 2b.","['functional', 'movement system', 'novice', 'reliability', 'screen']"

Vitamin D deficiency can activate the parathyroid to induce the release of parathyroid hormone, which was thought to increase serum uric acid level, and low vitamin D status may also be associated with risk of CVD. No known studies have explored the association between serum 25(OH) D, vitamin D intake, and HU for the American population. <b>Methods:</b> We extracted 15,723 US adults aged 20-85 years from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) in 2007-2014. All dietary intakes were evaluated through 24-h dietary recalls. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the associations after adjustment for confounders. <b>Results:</b> Compared to the lowest quintile (Q1), for males, adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of HU in Q2 to Q4 of serum 25(OH) D levels were 0.78 (95% CI, 0.65-0.93), 0.97 (0.81-1.16), and 0.72 (0.60-0.88); ORs in Q2-Q5 of total vitamin D intake were 0.83 (0.69-0.98), 0.69 (0.58-0.83), 0.66 (0.55-0.79), and 0.59 (0.48-0.71), respectively. In females, OR was 0.80 (0.66-0.97) of serum 25(OH) D for Q3, and ORs in Q5 of total vitamin D intake were 0.80 (0.65-0.98). <b>Conclusions:</b> Our findings indicated that the serum 25(OH) D intakes of dietary vitamin D, supplemental vitamin D, and total vitamin D were inversely associated with HU in males. In females, a lower risk of HU with higher serum 25(OH) D, dietary vitamin D, and total vitamin D intake was found, but with no association between supplemental vitamin D intake and the risk of HU.","['NHANES', 'cardiovascular disease', 'crosssectional study', 'hyperuricemia', 'vitamin D']"
Gender discrimination and depressive symptoms among child-bearing women: ELSPAC-CZ cohort study.,"Depression is approximately two-fold more prevalent among women than men. Social theories suggest that discrimination is a pathway through which gender inequalities affect women's lives, but data are lacking. This cohort study evaluates whether perceived gender discrimination is linked to depressive symptoms among child-bearing women.Data were obtained from 4,688 participants enrolled in pregnancy in 1991-92 in the European Longitudinal Cohort Study of Pregnancy and Childhood, Czech Republic. Perceived gender discrimination was assessed in mid-pregnancy, year seven, and year eleven. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale at eight time-points between mid-pregnancy and year eleven post-delivery. Linear mixed error-component models of depressive symptoms were estimated.Perceived gender discrimination, reported by 10.7% of women, was related to higher depressive symptoms, both in the unadjusted analysis (<i>b</i> = 0.15 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.12, 0.19], <i>p</i> < 0.001) and in the fully adjusted model (<i>b</i> = 0.12 [95% CI: 0.09, 0.16], <i>p</i> < 0.001). Covariates linked to higher depressive symptoms included financial hardship (<i>b</i> = 0.12 [95% CI: 0.10, 0.14], <i>p</i> < 0.001), childhood emotional/physical neglect (<i>b</i> = 0.18 [95% CI: 0.14, 0.22], <i>p</i> < 0.001), and childhood sexual abuse (<i>b</i> = 0.04 [95% CI: 0.03, 0.06], <i>p</i> < 0.001); an inverse relationship was evident for social support (-0.05 [95% CI: -0.07, -0.04], <i>p</i> < 0.001) and having a partner who performs female-stereotypical household tasks (<i>b</i>=-0.03 [95% CI: -0.05, -0.01], <i>p</i> = 0.001).The findings provide the first evidence that perceived gender discrimination is associated with depressive symptoms among child-bearing women. Social intervention programs aimed at reducing gender discrimination can potentially contribute to better mental health of women.Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.","['Depressive symptoms', 'Gender', 'Mental health']"
Macrocyclic MR contrast agents: evaluation of multiple-organ gadolinium retention in healthy rats.,"The purpose of this study was to compare Gd levels in rat tissues after cumulative exposure to four commercially available macrocyclic gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs).Sixty-five male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized to four exposure groups (n = 15 per group) and one control group (n = 5). Animals in each exposure group received 20 GBCA administrations (four per week of ProHance®, Dotarem®, Clariscan™, or Gadovist® for 5 consecutive weeks) at a dose of 0.6 mmol/kg bodyweight. After 28-days' recovery, animals were sacrificed and tissues harvested for Gd determination by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Histologic assessment of the kidney tissue was performed for all animals.Significantly (p ≤ 0.005; all evaluations) lower Gd levels were noted with ProHance® than with Dotarem®, Clariscan™, or Gadovist® in all soft tissue organs: 0.144 ± 0.015 nmol/g vs. 0.342 ± 0.045, 0.377 ± 0.042, and 0.292 ± 0.047 nmol/g, respectively, for cerebrum; 0.151 ± 0.039 nmol/g vs. 0.315 ± 0.04, 0.345 ± 0.053, and 0.316 ± 0.040 nmol/g, respectively, for cerebellum; 0.361 ± 0.106 nmol/g vs. 0.685 ± 0.330, 0.823 ± 0.495, and 1.224 ± 0.664 nmol/g, respectively, for liver; 38.6 ± 25.0 nmol/g vs. 172 ± 134, 212 ± 121, and 294 ± 127 nmol/g, respectively, for kidney; and 0.400 ± 0.112 nmol/g vs. 0.660 ± 0.202, 0.688 ± 0.215, and 0.999 ± 0.442 nmol/g, respectively, for skin. No GBCA-induced macroscopic or microscopic findings were noted in the kidneys.Less Gd is retained in the brain and body tissues of rats 28 days after the last exposure to ProHance® compared to other macrocyclic GBCAs, likely due to unique physico-chemical features that facilitate more rapid and efficient clearance.","['Contrast media', 'Gadolinium', 'Histology', 'Magnetic resonance imaging', 'Pharmacokinetics', 'Rats']"
Prevalence of Salmonella in 11 Spices Offered for Sale from Retail Establishments and in Imported Shipments Offered for Entry to the United States.,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration conducted a survey to evaluate Salmonella prevalence and aerobic plate counts in packaged (dried) spices offered for sale at retail establishments in the United States. The study included 7,250 retail samples of 11 spice types that were collected during November 2013 to September 2014 and October 2014 to March 2015. No Salmonella-positive samples (based on analysis of 125 g) were found among retail samples of cumin seed (whole or ground), sesame seed (whole, not roasted or toasted, and not black), and white pepper (ground or cracked), for prevalence estimates of 0.00% with 95% Clopper and Pearson's confidence intervals of 0.00 to 0.67%, 0.00 to 0.70%, and 0.00 to 0.63%, respectively. Salmonella prevalence estimates (confidence intervals) for the other eight spice types were 0.19% (0.0048 to 1.1%) for basil leaf (whole, ground, crushed, or flakes), 0.24% (0.049 to 0.69%) for black pepper (whole, ground, or cracked), 0.56% (0.11 to 1.6%) for coriander seed (ground), 0.19% (0.0049 to 1.1%) for curry powder (ground mixture of spices), 0.49% (0.10 to 1.4%) for dehydrated garlic (powder, granules, or flakes), 0.15% (0.0038 to 0.83%) for oregano leaf (whole, ground, crushed, or flakes), 0.25% (0.03 to 0.88%) for paprika (ground or cracked), and 0.64% (0.17 to 1.6%) for red pepper (hot red pepper, e.g., chili, cayenne; ground, cracked, crushed, or flakes). Salmonella isolates were serotyped, and genomes were sequenced. Samples of these same 11 spice types were also examined from shipments of imported spices offered for entry to the United States from 1 October 2011 to 30 September 2015. Salmonella prevalence estimates (based on analysis of two 375-g composite samples) for shipments of imported spices were 1.7 to 18%. The Salmonella prevalence estimates for spices offered for sale at retail establishments for all of the spice types except dehydrated garlic and basil were significantly lower than estimates for shipments of imported spice offered for entry.","['Salmonella', 'Import', 'Prevalence', 'Retail', 'Serotype', 'Spice']"
Study of the Biological Developmental Characteristics of the Eye in Children After Laser Surgery for the Treatment of Retinopathy of Prematurity.,"To observe the differences in ocular biology between premature infants who had undergone retinal laser photocoagulation (LP) for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and full-term infants and to investigate the relationships between these differences and the development of the refractive state.This retrospective, cross-sectional study included 25 children (50 eyes) who had undergone laser treatment for aggressive posterior retinopathy of prematurity (AP-ROP), ROP in zone I requiring treatment, or ROP in zone II requiring treatment in the posterior pole (laser group) and 29 full-term infants (58 eyes) who had not (control group). Basic information, spherical equivalent (SE), and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) were collected from the two groups. Their mean ages were 7.32 ± 2.85 and 7.34 ± 2.57 years, respectively (<i>t</i> = -0.047, <i>P</i> = 0.96). Ocular biology data were measured using an IOL Master 700 instrument (Carl Zeiss Meditec AG) and the data were processed using MATLAB (R2016a, Mathworks Inc.). The data markers included central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior and posterior surface corneal curvature radius (CCR), anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness (LT), lens anterior surface curvature radius, lens posterior surface curvature radius, and eye axis length (AL). Optometric data were collected simultaneously and all BCVA values were converted to the logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR) for analysis. The data were statistically analyzed using SPSS software (V.23.0). Independent sample <i>t</i>-tests were used for the assessment of ocular biology and refractive indices in both groups of children and Pearson correlation coefficients were used to evaluate the correlations between age, gestational age at birth and ocular biology structural parameters. <i>P</i> < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.Comparisons of ocular biomarkers, refractive status, and BCVA between children in the laser and control groups showed relationships among ocular biomarkers, including the corneal-related parameters of CCT (0.54 ± 0.04 mm and 0.56 ± 0.03 mm, <i>t</i> = -2.116, <i>P</i> < 0.05), anterior surface CCR (7.53 ± 0.33 mm and 7.84 ± 0.30 mm, <i>t</i> = -5.063, <i>P</i> < 0.05), posterior surface CCR (6.75 ± 0.34 mm and 7.03 ± 0.24 mm, <i>t</i> = -4.864, <i>P</i> < 0.05); as well as those related to anterior chamber depth (ACD) were 3.24 ± 0.26 mm and 3.64 ± 0.26 mm, respectively (<i>t</i> = -8.065, <i>P</i> < 0.05), lens-related parameters (LT) were 3.80 ± 0.19 mm and 3.45 ± 0.16 mm, respectively (<i>t</i> = 10.514, <i>P</i> < 0.05); anterior lens surface curvature radius were 10.02 ± 0.93 mm and 10.52 ± 0.85 mm, respectively (<i>t</i> = -2.962, <i>P</i> < 0.05); posterior lens surface curvature radius were 5.55 ± 0.51 mm and 5.80 ± 0.36 mm, respectively (<i>t</i> = -2.917, <i>P</i> < 0.05), and ocular axis (AL) were 22.60 ± 1.42 mm and 23.45 ± 1.23 mm, respectively (<i>t</i> = -3.332, <i>P</i> < 0.05). Moreover, comparison of refractive status and BCVA between two groups of children showed an SE of -1.23 ± 3.38 D and -0.07 ± 2.00 D (<i>t</i> = -2.206, <i>P</i> < 0.05) and LogMAR (BCVA) of 0.12 ± 0.13 and 0.05 ± 0.11 (<i>t</i> = 3.070, <i>P</i> < 0.05). Analysis of the correlations between age and ocular biomarkers and refractive status of children in the laser and control groups showed correlations between age and ocular biomarkers in the two groups, in which age in the laser group was positively correlated with AL (<i>r</i> = 0.625, <i>P</i> < 0.05) but not with other biomarkers (<i>P</i> > 0.05). Age in the control group was negatively correlated with CCT, ACD, and AL (<i>r</i> = 0.303, 0.468, 0.703, <i>P</i> < 0.05), as well as with LT (<i>r</i> = -0.555, <i>P</i> < 0.05), with no correlation with other biomarkers (<i>P</i> > 0.05). Analysis of the correlation between age and refractive status of children in both groups showed that the age of children in both laser and control groups was negatively correlated with SE (<i>r</i> = -0.528, -0.655, <i>P</i> < 0.05) and LogMAR (BCVA) (<i>r</i> = -0.538, -0.542, <i>P</i> < 0.05). Analysis of the correlations between refractive status and ocular biomarkers in children in the laser and control groups showed that the refractive status in children in the laser group was negatively correlated with AL (<i>r</i> = -0.773, <i>P</i> < 0.05) but not with other biomarkers in this group (<i>P</i> > 0.05). The refractive status of children in the control group was negatively correlated with ACD and AL (<i>r</i> = -0.469, -0.734, <i>P</i> < 0.05), positively correlated with LT (<i>r</i> = 0.364, <i>P</i> < 0.05), and was not correlated with other biomarkers in this group (<i>P</i> > 0.05). Analysis of the correlations of gestational age at birth with ocular biomarkers and refractive status in children in the laser group showed a positive correlation between gestational age at birth and AL (<i>r</i> = 0.435, <i>P</i> < 0.05) but no other correlations with the other biomarkers (<i>P</i> > 0.05). Moreover, gestational age at birth was negatively correlated with SE (<i>r</i> = -0.334, <i>P</i> < 0.05) and LogMAR (BCVA) (<i>r</i> = -0.307, <i>P</i> < 0.05) in children in the laser group.Compared to full-term infants, the development of CCT, ACD, LT, and AL was relatively delayed after ROP laser surgery, resulting in thin central corneal thickness, steep corneas, shallow anterior chambers, thicker lenses, ""rounder"" lens morphology, increased refractive power, and short eye axes, leading to the development of myopia. The changes in refractive status were mainly influenced by increased lens thickness. The results of this study showed that the lower the gestational age at birth, the greater the effects on emmetropization in children after ROP, and the more likely the development of myopia.","['central corneal thickness', 'laser photocoagulation', 'lens thickness', 'ocular biology', 'refractive error', 'retinopathy of prematurity']"
Superiority of integrated cervicothoracic immobilization in the setup of lung cancer patients treated with supraclavicular station irradiation.,"To investigate the superiority of the integrated cervicothoracic immobilization devices (ICTID) on the mobility of the supraclavicular station in lung cancer patients requiring both primary lung lesion and positive supraclavicular lymph nodes irradiation.One hundred patients with lung cancer were prospectively enrolled in the study. The following four different fixation methods are used for CT simulation positioning: thoracoabdominal flat immobilization device fixation with arms lifting (TAFID group), head-neck-shoulder immobilization device fixation with arms on the body sides (HNSID group), ICTID fixation with arms on the body sides (ICTID arms-down group), and n ICTID fixation with arms lifting (ICTID arms-up group). Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images are taken daily or weekly before treatment, to assess anatomical changes during the radiotherapy course.The translation errors in X (left-right direction), Y (head-foot direction), and Z (abdomen-back direction) directions of the ICTID arms-up, TAFID, ICTID arms-down and HNSID groups were (0.15 ± 0.18) cm, (0.15 ± 0.16) cm, (0.16 ± 0.16) cm, and (0.15 ± 0.20) cm; (0.15 ± 0.15) cm, (0.21 ± 0.25) cm, (0.28 ± 0.23) cm, and (0.27 ± 0.21) cm; (0.13 ± 0.14) cm, (0.15 ± 0.14) cm, (0.17 ± 0.13) cm, and (0.16 ± 0.14) cm, respectively. Among them, the ICTID arms-up group had the minimal setup errors in X direction than those in ICTID arms-down (p=0.001) and HNSID groups (p=0.001), and in Y direction than those in TAFID (p<0.001), and in Z direction than those in ICTID arms-down (p<0.001) and TAFID groups (p=0.034). For the rotational errors of the four groups in the directions of sagittal plane, transverse plane, and coronal plane, the ICTID arms-up group had the smallest setup errors in the sagittal plane than that of TAFID groups and similar rotation setup errors with those of the other three groups.For patients requiring radiation of primary lung lesion and positive supraclavicular lymph nodes, an integrated frame fixation device is preferred the ICTID arms-up methods provide the smallest set up error and satisfied repeatability of body position, compared with TAFID and HNSID.","['integrated cervicothoracic immobilization device', 'lung cancer', 'positioning error', 'radiotherapy', 'thoracoabdominal flat immobilization device']"
"BestCyte® Cell Sorter Imaging System: Primary and adjudicative whole slide image rescreening review times of 500 ThinPrep Pap test thin-layers - An intra-observer, time-surrogate analysis of diagnostic confidence potentialities.","The novel Artificial Intelligence-driven BestCyte® Cell Sorter Imaging System (BestCyte) enables hybrid digital screening through classification and sorting of tiles depicting cells in 8 galleries or whole slide image (WSI) reviews.(1) Analyze expenditures of time (minutes) for primary BestCyte cell sorter screening and adjudicative WSI rescreening of 500 blinded, randomized ThinPrep thin-layers to determine review times per Bethesda nomenclature; (2) Analyze review times for NILM qualifier diagnoses reflecting increasing interpretive complexity (i.e., Inflammation, Reactive/Repair, Bacterial cytolysis, Bacterial vaginosis, Atrophy, and Atrophic vaginitis); (3) Challenge accuracy of primary diagnoses (Downgraded, Upheld, and Upgraded) following adjudicative WSI rescreening to assess correlated review times as surrogate indicators of diagnostic confidence in BestCyte functionality (i.e., learning curve); and (4) Correlate primary and adjudicative diagnoses to calculate intra-observer reproducibility Kappa coefficients per Bethesda nomenclature.Of 500 thin-layers, the mean [primary/adjudicative rescreening review times (minutes)] were: Overall study [1.38/3.94], NILM [1.23/3.02], ASCUS [1.18/2.53], ASC-H [1.73/4.86], AGUS [1.84/6.34], LSIL [1.49/4.16], HSIL [1.52/4.10], CA [0.65/2.57]. Of 500 primary Bethesda diagnoses: 2 (0.40%) downgraded; 483 (96.6%) upheld; 15 (3.00%) upgraded after adjudicative WSI rescreening. Of 354 NILM diagnoses: 0 downgraded; 344 (97.2%) upheld; 10 (2.82%) upgraded. Of 34 ASCUS diagnoses: 2 (5.88%) downgraded; 28 (82.4%) upheld; 4 (11.8%) upgraded. Of 17 ASC-H diagnoses: 0 downgraded; 16 (94.1%) upheld; 1 (5.88%) upgraded. Of AGUS (n=1), LSIL (n=24), HSIL (n=52), CA (n=1), UNSAT (n=17): 100% upheld. Kappa coefficients with 95% (Confidence Intervals): Overall study 0.9305 (0.8983-0.9627), NILM 0.9429 (0.9110-0.9748), ASCUS 0.8378 (0.7393-0.9363), ASC-H 0.9112 (0.8113-0.9999), AGUS 1.0 (1.0-1.0), LSIL 0.9189 (0.8400-0.9978), HSIL 0.9894 (0.9685-0.9999), CA 1.0 (1.0-1.0), UNSAT 1.0 (1.0-1.0). Primary BestCyte cell image review time trends for NILM, ASCUS, LSIL, and HSIL, revealed plateaus relative to decreasing respective adjudicative WSI rescreening times.Given innovative robustness, BestCyte accommodates interpretive fundamentals, enabling shorter ThinPrep thin-layer review times with optimal intra-observer concordance per Bethesda nomenclature through classifying, ranking, sorting, and displaying clinically relevant cells efficiently in galleries. BestCyte fosters continuously optimizing diagnostic confidence learning curves; may supplant manual microscopy for primary screening.","['Adjudicative whole slide image rescreening', 'Artificial Intelligencebased cytology', 'BestCyte cell sorter imaging system', 'Intraobserver reproducibility', 'Review times', 'Virtual primary screening']"
Mental health status and quality of life in patients with end-stage renal disease undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.,"This study aimed to identify the association of factors and poorer mental health status and examinate the correlation between mental health status and quality of life (QOL) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing maintenance hemodialysis.A total of 190 patients were included in this observational, cross-sectional study. Psychological states of ESRD patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis were evaluated by the Chinese version symptom checklist-90 (SCL-90) and QOL was assessed using the Chinese Version Kidney Disease Quality of Life-Short Form (KDQOL-SF).A total of 190 patients with a mean age of 61.68 (13.39) years were included in this study. Multiple stepwise linear regression analyses suggested that when controlling for the confounding variables, prealbumin had the significant influence on average positive factors (Coef., -0.647; 95% CI: -1.314, 0.020; P=0.057), somatization (Coef., -1.334; 95% CI: -2.451, -0.217; P=0.020), obsessive-compulsive (Coef., -1.396; 95% CI: -2.255, -0.537; P=0.002), depression (Coef., -1.241; 95% CI: -2.252, -0.229; P=0.017), phobic anxiety (Coef., -2.576; 95% CI: -3.786, -1.367; P<0.001). In the correlation analysis, the score of average positive factors was significantly correlated with the score of the overall health rating (Coef., -0.343; P<0.001), symptom/problem (Coef., -0.337; P<0.001), effects of kidney disease on daily life (Coef., -0.198; P=0.006), burden of kidney disease (Coef., -0.233; P=0.001), cognitive function (Coef., 0.363; P<0.001), quality of social interaction (Coef., 0.292; P<0.001), social support (Coef., 0.237; P=0.001), physical functioning (Coef., -0.339; P<0.001), pain (Coef., 0.362; P<0.001), general health (Coef., -0.332; P<0.001), mental health (Coef., -0.537; P<0.001), social functioning (Coef., 0.202; P=0.005), vitality (Coef., -0.478; P<0.001), respectively.In our study, prealbumin, type 2 diabetes mellitus, heart rate, educational level, duration of hemodialysis, coronary artery disease, heart failure, marital status, hemoglobin A1C, hemoglobin were significantly associated with poorer mental health status of ESRD patients undergoing maintenance hemodialysis, and patients with poorer psychological states were more significantly associated with decreased QOL. The results may help clinicians to adopt an effective treatment for early interventions, thus improving the QOL in such population.","['Chinese', 'Maintenance hemodialysis', 'psychological states', 'quality of life QOL', 'symptom checklist90']"
Childhood and adult exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke and cardiac structure and function: results from Echo-SOL.,"To describe the relationship of household secondhand smoke (SHS) exposure and cardiac structure and function.Participants (n=1069; 68 % female; age 45-74 years) without history of tobacco use, coronary artery disease or severe valvular disease were included. Past childhood (starting at age <13 years), adolescent/adult and current exposure to household SHS was assessed. Survey linear regression analyses were used to model the relationship of SHS exposure and echocardiographic measures of cardiac structure and function, adjusting for covariates (age, sex, study site, alcohol use, physical activity and education).SHS exposure in childhood only was associated with reduced E/A velocity ratio (β=-0.06 (SE 0.02), p=0.008). SHS exposure in adolescence/adult only was associated with increased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) (1.2 (0.6), p=0.04), left atrial volume index (1.7 (0.8), p=0.04) and decreased isovolumic relaxation time (-0.003 (0.002), p=0.03). SHS exposure in childhood and adolescence/adult was associated with worse left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS) (two-chamber) (0.8 (0.4), p= 0.049). Compared with individuals who do not live with a tobacco smoker, individuals who currently live with at least one tobacco smoker had reduced LVEF (-1.4 (0.6), p=0.02), LVGLS (average) (0.9 (0.40), p=0.03), medial E' velocity (-0.5 (0.2), p=0.01), E/A ratio (-0.09 (0.03), p=0.003) and right ventricular fractional area change (-0.02 (0.01), p=0.01) with increased isovolumic relaxation time (0.006 (0.003), p=0.04).Past and current household exposure to SHS was associated with abnormalities in cardiac systolic and diastolic function. Reducing household SHS exposure may be an opportunity for cardiac dysfunction prevention to reduce the risk of future clinical heart failure.","['echocardiography', 'epidemiology', 'heart failure', 'tobacco smoke pollution']"
Estimating mean change in population salt intake using spot urine samples.,"Spot urine samples are easier to collect than 24-h urine samples and have been used with estimating equations to derive the mean daily salt intake of a population. Whether equations using data from spot urine samples can also be used to estimate change in mean daily population salt intake over time is unknown. We compared estimates of change in mean daily population salt intake based upon 24-h urine collections with estimates derived using equations based on spot urine samples.Paired and unpaired 24-h urine samples and spot urine samples were collected from individuals in two Australian populations, in 2011 and 2014. Estimates of change in daily mean population salt intake between 2011 and 2014 were obtained directly from the 24-h urine samples and by applying established estimating equations (Kawasaki, Tanaka, Mage, Toft, INTERSALT) to the data from spot urine samples. Differences between 2011 and 2014 were calculated using mixed models.A total of 1000 participants provided a 24-h urine sample and a spot urine sample in 2011, and 1012 did so in 2014 (paired samples n = 870; unpaired samples n = 1142). The participants were community-dwelling individuals living in the State of Victoria or the town of Lithgow in the State of New South Wales, Australia, with a mean age of 55 years in 2011. The mean (95% confidence interval) difference in population salt intake between 2011 and 2014 determined from the 24-h urine samples was -0.48g/day (-0.74 to -0.21; P < 0.001). The corresponding result estimated from the spot urine samples was -0.24 g/day (-0.42 to -0.06; P = 0.01) using the Tanaka equation, -0.42 g/day (-0.70 to -0.13; p = 0.004) using the Kawasaki equation, -0.51 g/day (-1.00 to -0.01; P = 0.046) using the Mage equation, -0.26 g/day (-0.42 to -0.10; P = 0.001) using the Toft equation, -0.20 g/day (-0.32 to -0.09; P = 0.001) using the INTERSALT equation and -0.27 g/day (-0.39 to -0.15; P < 0.001) using the INTERSALT equation with potassium. There was no evidence that the changes detected by the 24-h collections and estimating equations were different (all P > 0.058). Separate analysis of the unpaired and paired data showed that detection of change by the estimating equations was observed only in the paired data.All the estimating equations based upon spot urine samples identified a similar change in daily salt intake to that detected by the 24-h urine samples. Methods based upon spot urine samples may provide an approach to measuring change in mean population salt intake, although further investigation in larger and more diverse population groups is required.","['24h urine collection', 'Salt intake', 'sodium', 'spot urine collection']"
The effect of body weight on distal airway function and airway inflammation.,"Obesity is a global health problem that adversely influences the respiratory system. We assessed the effects of body mass index (BMI) on distal airway function and airway inflammation.Impulse oscillometry (IOS) as a measure of distal airway function, together with spirometry, were assessed in adults with a range of different BMIs. Airway inflammation was assessed with the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and participants exhaled at various exhalation flows to determine alveolar and bronchial NO.In total 34 subjects were enrolled in the study; 19 subjects had a normal BMI (18.50-24.99), whilst 15 subjects were overweight (BMI 25.00-29.99), or obese (BMI ≥30). All subjects had normal spirometry. However, IOS measures of airway resistance (R) at 5Hz, 20Hz and frequency dependence (R<sub>5-20</sub>) were elevated in overweight/obese individuals, compared to subjects with a normal BMI (median (interquartile range)); 5Hz: 0.41 (0.37, 0.45) vs. 0.32 (0.30, 0.37)kPa/l/s; 20Hz: 0.34 (0.30, 0.37) vs. 0.30 (0.26, 0.33)kPa/l/s; R<sub>5-20</sub>: 0.06 (0.04, 0.11) vs. 0.03 (0.01, 0.05)kPa/l/s; p<0.05), whereas airway reactance at 20Hz was decreased in overweight/obese individuals (20Hz: 0.07 (0.03, 0.09) vs. 0.10 (0.07, 0.13)kPa/l/s, p=0.009; 5Hz: -0.12 (-0.15, -0.10) vs. -0.10 (-0.13, -0.09)kPa/l/s, p=0.07). In contrast, within-breath IOS measures (a sign of expiratory flow limitation) and FeNO inflammatory measures, did not differ between groups (p>0.05).Being overweight has significant effects on distal and central airway function as determined by IOS, which is not detected by spirometry. Obesity does not influence airway inflammation as measured by FeNO. IOS is a reliable technique to identify airway abnormalities in the presence of normal spirometry in overweight people.","['Body mass index', 'Fraction of exhaled nitric oxide', 'Impulse oscillometry', 'Lung function']"
Structured Moderate Exercise and Biomarkers of Kidney Health in Sedentary Older Adults: The Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders Randomized Clinical Trial.,"In the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) trial, a structured exercise intervention slowed kidney function decline in sedentary older adults. Biomarkers of kidney health could distinguish potential mechanisms for this beneficial effect.Randomized controlled trial.A total of 1,381 sedentary adults aged 70-89 years enrolled in the LIFE trial.Structured, 2-year, moderate-intensity exercise intervention versus health education.Physical activity was measured by step count. Primary outcomes were changes in 14 serum and urine biomarkers of kidney health collected at baseline, year 1, and year 2. We determined the effect of randomization on changes in kidney measures and then evaluated observational associations of achieved activity on each measure.Participants assigned to exercise walked on average 291 more steps per day than participants assigned to health education. The intervention was not significantly associated with changes in biomarkers of kidney health. In observational analyses, persons in the highest versus lowest quartile of activity (≥3,470 vs <1,568 steps/day) had significant improvement in urine albumin (mean, -0.22 mg albumin/g urine creatinine [interquartile range (IQR), -0.37 to -0.06]), alpha-1-microglobulin (-0.18 mg/L [-0.28 to -0.08]), trefoil factor-3 (-0.24 pg/mL [-0.35 to -0.13]), epidermal growth factor (0.19 pg/mL [0.06-0.32]), uromodulin (0.06 pg/mL [0.00-0.12]), interleukin 18 (-0.09 pg/mL [-0.15 to -0.03]), neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (-0.16 pg/mL [-0.24 to -0.07]), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (-0.25 pg/mL [-0.36 to -0.14]), clusterin (-0.16 pg/mL [-0.30 to -0.02]), serum tumor necrosis factor receptor-1 (-0.25 mg/dL [-0.39 to -0.11]) and tumor necrosis factor receptor-2 (-0.30 mg/dL [-0.44 to -0.16]). In sensitivity analyses, incremental changes in activity were most impactful on urine interleukin 18 and serum tumor necrosis factor-1.The original study was not designed to assess the impact on kidney health. Non-white individuals and patients with advanced chronic kidney disease are underrepresented.Randomization to structured exercise did not improve kidney health at a group level. However, higher exercise was associated with concurrent improvements in biomarkers of glomerular injury, tubular function/repair, tubular injury, generalized inflammation, and tubulointerstitial repair/fibrosis.In the Lifestyle Interventions For Elders (LIFE) study, randomization to an exercise and physical activity intervention improved the slope of estimated glomerular filtration rate over 2 years compared with health education among older adults. In this study, we sought to determine whether there were specific biomarkers of kidney health that were affected by the exercise and physical activity intervention to investigate potential mechanisms for this positive impact on kidney decline. We found that randomization to the intervention did not improve any of the 14 measures of kidney tubule health. However, in observational analyses, higher activity was independently associated with improvements in several domains, especially tubular injury and generalized inflammation. These results help to clarify the impact of physical activity on kidney health.","['Biomarkers', 'exercise', 'kidney health', 'older adults', 'physical activity']"
"Knowledge, attitude, and practice of patients with major depressive disorder on exercise therapy.","This study aimed to explore the knowledge, attitude, and practice (KAP) toward exercise therapy of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).This cross-sectional study was conducted at the First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University between April and October 2023 in patients with MDD. A self-designed questionnaire was used to evaluate the KAP (Cronbach's α = 0.787). The minimum-maximum scores were 2-23 for knowledge, 11-55 for attitude, and 7-35 for practice.A total of 494 valid questionnaires were analyzed. The mean KAP dimension scores were 15.39 ± 3.34/23 (66.91%), 36.54 ± 19.33/55 (66.44%), and 19.33 ± 5.22/35 (55.23%), indicating poor knowledge, negative attitude, and weak practice. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that female (OR = 0.613, 95%CI: 0.376-1.000, P = 0.050), urban residence (OR = 0.443, 95%CI: 0.259-0.758, P = 0.003), suburban residence (OR = 0.047, 95%CI: 0.016-0.138, P < 0.001), higher income (OR = 3.889-7.928, all P < 0.001), and unclear self-reported depression level (OR = 0.078, 95%CI: 0.027-0.221, P < 0.001) were independently associated with the knowledge scores. Knowledge scores (OR = 1.102, 95%CI: 1.022-1.188, P = 0.011), female gender (OR = 0.437, 95%CI: 0.246-0.776, P = 0.005), city (OR = 0.410, 95%CI: 0.226-0.744, P = 0.003), married (OR = 3.577, 95%CI: 1.751-7.650, P < 0.001), higher income (OR = 0.065-0.392, both P < 0.050), depressive trend (OR = 2.640, 95%CI: 1.110-6.278, P = 0.028), high depression score level (OR = 0.176, 95%CI: 0.104-0.300, P < 0.001), and unclear self-reported depression score (OR = 0.023, 95%CI: 0.007-0.076, P < 0.001) were independently associated with the attitude scores. Finally, knowledge scores (OR = 1.130, 95%CI: 1.051-1.215, P = 0.001), attitude scores (OR = 1.199, 95%CI: 1.124-1.280, P < 0.001), and city (OR = 0.583, 95%CI: 0.352-0.965, P = 0.036) were independently associated with the practice scores. The structural equation modeling analysis showed that knowledge, but not attitude (β = 0.103, P = 0.092) or practice (β = 0.034, P = 0.603), influenced the depression level (β=-0.074, P < 0.001); attitude influenced practice (β = 0.369, P < 0.001).The KAP toward exercise among MDD patients is poor in Shanxi. Females, people living in urban or suburban areas, with lower income, and self-reported unclear depression levels should be targeted by education interventions.","['Attitudes', 'Crosssectional study', 'Education interventions', 'Exercise', 'Knowledge', 'Major depressive disorder', 'Practice']"
The Relationships Between Skeletal Muscle Index and Bone Variables in a Group of Young Adults.,"The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationships between skeletal muscle index (SMI) and bone variables in a group of young adults. Three hundred and thirty-five young adults (129 men and 206 women) whose ages ranged from 18 to 35 yr voluntarily participated in this study. Weight and height were measured, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. Body composition, bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD), geometric indices of hip bone strength and trabecular bone score (TBS) were determined for each individual by Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Appendicular skeletal mass (ASM, in kg) was calculated by summing the muscle masses of the 4 limbs, assuming that all nonfat and nonebone mass is skeletal muscle. Skeletal muscle index (SMI) was defined as ASM/height². In young men, SMI was positively correlated to WB BMC (r = 0.63; p < 0.001), WB BMD (r = 0.53; p < 0.001), L1-L4 BMC (r = 0.33; p < 0.001), L1-L4 BMD (r = 0.30; p < 0.001), L1-L4 TBS (r = 0.26; p < 0.01), TH BMC (r = 0.61; p < 0.001), TH BMD (r = 0.46; p < 0.001), FN BMC (r = 0.51; p < 0.001), FN BMD (r = 0.46; p < 0.001), FN cross-sectional area (CSA) (r = 0.56; p < 0.001), FN cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI) (r = 0.52; p < 0.001) and FN section modulus (Z) (r = 0.54; p < 0.001) but negatively correlated to FN strength index (SI) (r = -0.24; p < 0.01). In young women, SMI was positively correlated to WB BMC (r = 0.61; p < 0.001), WB BMD (r = 0.60; p < 0.001), L1-L4 BMC (r = 0.35; p < 0.001), L1-L4 BMD (r = 0.33; p < 0.001), L1-L4 TBS (r = 0.29; p < 0.001), TH BMC (r = 0.61; p < 0.001), TH BMD (r = 0.53; p < 0.001), FN BMC (r = 0.45; p < 0.001), FN BMD (r = 0.49; p < 0.001), FN CSA (r = 0.60; p < 0.001), FN CSMI (r = 0.52; p < 0.001), and FN Z (r = 0.40; p < 0.001) but negatively correlated to FN SI (r = -0.20; p < 0.01). The current study suggests that SMI is a positive determinant of bone mineral density and geometric indices of hip bone strength in young adults.","['Appendicular skeletal mass', 'DXA', 'peak bone mass']"
Meta-analysis of magnetic resonance imaging for the differential diagnosis of spinal degeneration.,"To systematically evaluate the clinical significance of magnetic resonance imaging for the identification and diagnosis of spinal degenerative changes. We searched Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMbase, CNKI, WanFang Data, Medalink, VIP and CBM databases for clinical studies on the significance of magnetic resonance imaging for the differential diagnosis of spinal degeneration; retrieval time was from database building to October 2014. Two reviewers independently screened the literature, extracted data and evaluated methodological quality according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Meta-DiSc 1.4 software was used for meta-analysis. The study included six documents, 10 independent results and a total of 505 individuals. Meta-analysis showed that: In the present study, the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging in the differential diagnosis of cervical and lumbar degeneration was firstly analyzed and discussed using the Meta-Disc 1.4 software. SPE: χ(2) = 77.59, P = 0.000, I(2) = 88.4%; SEN: χ(2) = 167.25, P = 0.000, I(2) = 94.6%; DOR: Cochran-Q = 71.64, P = 0.000. Meta-analysis of random effect model showed that: SEN merge = 0.849 [95% CI (0.816,0.878)], SPE merge = 0.745 [95% CI (0.695, 0.792)], + LR = 2.735 [95% CI (1.600, -4.676)], - LR = 0.245 [95% CI (0.122, -0.493)], DOR merge = 21.158 [95% CI (5.234, -85.529)], SROC AUC = 0.8698; the results had good stability. Then the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging in the differential diagnosis of cervical degeneration was analyzed and the results showed that: SPE: χ(2) = 6.92, P = 0.075, I(2) = 56.6%; SEN: χ(2) = 81.73, P = 0.000, I(2) = 96.3%; DOR: Cochran-Q = 12.71, P = 0.005. Meta-analysis of random effect model showed that: SEN merge = 0.799 [95% CI (0.741, 0.850)], SPE merge = 0.769 [95% CI (0.683, -0.840)], + LR = 2.506 [95% CI (1.399, -4.489)], - LR = 0.363 [95% CI (0.149, -0.882)], DOR merge = 11.949 [95% CI (2.195, -65.036)], SROC AUC = 0.8210. The stability was good. Finally, analysis of six independent studies on the efficacy of magnetic resonance imaging in the differential diagnosis of lumbar degeneration was performed: SPE: χ(2) = 70.13, P = 0.000, I(2) = 92.9%; SEN: χ(2) = 78.35, P = 0.000, I(2) = 93.6%; DOR: Cochran-Q = 58.04, P = 0.000. Meta-analysis of random effect model showed that: SEN merge = 0.732 [95% CI (0.667, -0.791)] SPE merge = 0.883 [95% CI (0.843, -0.916)], + LR = 3.072 [95% CI (1.330, -7.091)], - LR = 0.190 [95% CI (0.063, -0.572)], DOR merge = 30.252 [95% CI (3.060, -299.13)], SROC AUC = 0.8994. Sensitivity analysis was performed by excluding each study individually and the results showed no significant changes in SEN and SPE merge, indicating good stability of the meta-analysis. Existing studies confirm that MRI had good sensitivity and specificity for the differential diagnosis of cervical and lumbar degeneration; the positive ratio in cervical and lumbar degeneration group was 3 to 10 times of that in non-degeneration control group; the efficacy for differential diagnosis was good; combined with the good maneuverability in clinical diagnosis of spinal degeneration, it can be used as effective and feasible method for clinical differential diagnosis of spinal degenerative diseases.","['MRI', 'cervical degeneration', 'differential diagnosis', 'lumbar degeneration', 'metaanalysis']"
Effectiveness of Response Inhibition Training and Its Long-Term Effects in Healthy Adults: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and long-term effects of response inhibition training as a therapeutic approach in healthy adults.The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, and China Science and Technology Journal Database (VIP) were searched for studies. Data on the improvement of Cognitive function and its long-term effect were extracted by two authors independently. The pooled data were meta-analyzed using a random-effects model, and the quality of each eligible study was assessed by The Cochrane Collaboration's tool.Nine articles were included. 1 of the articles included 2 trials, so 10 eligible trials (response inhibition training group vs. control group) were identified. A total of 490 patients were included. Response inhibition training has beneficial effects on improving cognitive function in healthy adults compared to control treatment (SMD, -0.93; 95% CI, -1.56 to -0.30; <i>Z</i> = 2.88, <i>P</i> = 0.004), the subgroup analysis results showed that either GNG training alone (SMD, -2.27; 95% CI, -3.33 to -1.21; <i>Z</i> = 4.18, <i>P</i> < 0.0001) or the combination of both SST and GNG significantly improved cognitive function in healthy adults (SMD, -0.94; 95% CI, -1.33 to -0.56; <i>Z</i> = 4.80, <i>P</i> < 0.0001), whereas SST training alone did not have such an effect (SMD, -0.15; 95% CI, -0.76 to 0.47; <i>Z</i> = 0.47, <i>P</i> = 0.64). But its long-term effects are not significant (SMD, -0.29; 95% CI, -0.68 to 0.10; <i>Z</i> = 1.45, <i>P</i> = 0.15). The subgroup analysis results showed that neither GNG training alone (SMD, -0.25; 95% CI, -0.75 to 0.24; <i>Z</i> = 0.99, <i>P</i> = 0.32) nor SST training alone (SMD, 0.03; 95% CI, -0.42 to 0.48; <i>Z</i> = 0.14, <i>P</i> = 0.89) could improve the cognitive function of healthy adults in the long term. In contrast, the combination of both training (SMD, -0.95; 95% CI, -1.46 to -0.45; <i>Z</i> = 3.68, <i>P</i> = 0.0002) can have long-term effects on the improvement of cognitive function in healthy adults.The findings of our study indicate that response inhibition training can improve the cognitive function of healthy adults and that more RCTs need to be conducted to validate their usefulness in clinical cases.","['healthy adults', 'longterm effects', 'metaanalysis', 'randomized controlled trial', 'response inhibition training']"
Tracheal intubation while wearing personal protective equipment in simulation studies: a systematic review and meta-analysis with trial-sequential analysis.,"Tracheal intubation in patients with coronavirus disease-19 is a high-risk procedure that should be performed with personal protective equipment (PPE). The influence of PPE on operator's performance during tracheal intubation remains unclear.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of simulation studies to evaluate the influence of wearing PPE as compared to standard uniform regarding time-to-intubation (TTI) and success rate. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to device used and operator's experience.The TTI was prolonged when wearing PPE (eight studies): Standard Mean Difference (SMD) -0.54, 95% Confidence Interval [-0.75, -0.34], p <  0.0001. Subgroup analyses according to device used showed similar findings (direct laryngoscopy, SMD -0.63 [-0.88, -0.38], p < 0.0001; videolaryngoscopy, SMD -0.39 [-0.75, -0.02], p =  0.04). Considering the operator's experience, non-anesthesiologists had prolonged TTI (SMD -0.75 [-0.98, -0.52], p < 0.0001) while the analysis on anesthesiologists did not show significant differences (SMD -0.25 [-0.51, 0.01], p = 0.06). The success rate of tracheal intubation was not influenced by PPE: Risk Ratio (RR) 1.02 [1.00, 1.04]; p = 0.12). Subgroup analyses according to device demonstrated similar results (direct laryngoscopy, RR 1.03 [0.99, 1.07], p = 0.15, videolaryngoscopy, RR 1.01 [0.98, 1.04], p =  0.52). Wearing PPE had a trend towards negative influence on success rate in non-anesthesiologists (RR 1.05 [1.00, 1.10], p = 0.05), but not in anesthesiologists (RR 1.00 [0.98, 1.03], p = 0.84). Trial-sequential analyses for TTI and success rate indicated robustness of both results.Under simulated conditions, wearing PPE delays the TTI as compared to dressing standard uniform, with no influence on the success rate. However, certainty of evidence is very low. Performing tracheal intubation with direct laryngoscopy seems influenced to a greater extent as compared to videolaryngoscopy. Similarly, wearing PPE affects more the non-anesthesiologists subgroup as compared to anesthesiologists.","['Anesthesiologists', 'Direct laryngoscopy', 'Paramedics', 'Success rate', 'Time to intubation', 'Videolaryngoscopy']"
Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and fetal thyroid hormone levels in umbilical cord blood among newborns by prelabor caesarean delivery.,"Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been reported to disrupt the thyroid function. But epidemiological evidence on the association between PFAS and thyroid hormone (TH) levels in cord blood is scarce and controversial. We aimed to examine the association between cord blood PFAS concentrations and TH levels in prelabor caesarean deliveries.We measured ten PFAS and three THs in cord blood in 568 prelabor caesarean deliveries. The associations between PFAS and TH levels were examined using multiple linear regression model and sparse partial least squares (SPLS) regression model.In SPLS analyses, thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) level decreased with increasing concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS, β = -0.012, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.019, -0.005), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA, β = -0.012, 95% CI: -0.019, -0.005), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA, β = -0.012, 95% CI: -0.02, -0.005), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUA, β = -0.013, 95% CI: -0.021, -0.006) and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA, β = -0.013, 95% CI: -0.023, -0.006). Moreover, we found a positive association between PFDoA and free thyroxine (FT4) levels (β = 0.190, 95% CI: 0.063, 0.304) after adjusting for potential confounders. Free tri-iodothyronine (FT3) levels were positively associated with concentrations of PFOS (β = 0.059, 95% CI: 0.023, 0.100), but negatively associated with PFDoA (β = -0.153, 95% CI: -0.212, -0.106). We also observed gender disparity in the associations of PFAS exposure and FT3, FT4, TSH levels.Our results suggest that prenatal exposure to certain PFAS may disrupt fetal thyroid function. The effect may be gender-specific.","['Caesarean delivery', 'Cord blood', 'Perfluoroalkyl substances', 'Sparse partial least squares SPLS regression', 'Thyroid hormones']"
A Strong Correlation Between the Severity of Flatfoot and Symptoms of Knee Osteoarthritis in 95 Patients.,"The purpose of this study is to assess the association between the presence and severity of flatfoot and symptoms of knee OA.95 participants with knee OA were recruited from a patient cohort at a regional hospital. Symptoms of knee OA, including knee degeneration, femorotibial alignment, pain, stiffness and dysfunction were assessed using the Kellgren-Lawrence (K-L) grading system, femoral-tibial angle (FTA), and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). Participants were divided into groups with flatfoot (mild, moderate and severe) and without flatfoot based on the Clarke's angle. Linear regression and ordinal logistic regression were used for statistical analysis, as appropriate.Having flatfoot was associated with a significantly increased risk of having a higher K-L grade (OR: 20.03; 95% CI, 5.88, 68.27; <i>p</i> < 0.001), smaller FTA (Beta: -2.96; 95% CI, -4.41, -1.50; <i>p</i> < 0.001), higher pain score (Beta: 0.47; 95% CI, 0.24, 0.69; <i>p</i> < 0.001) and greater loss of function (Beta: 0.25; 95% CI, 0.02, 0.48; <i>p</i> = 0.03). Severe grades of flat feet were associated with a higher K-L grade (OR: 0.19; 95% CI, 0.08, 0.44; <i>p</i> < 0.001), smaller FTA (Beta: 1.51; 95% CI, 0.66, 2.35; <i>p</i> = 0.001), higher pain score (Beta: -0.25; 95% CI, -0.39, -0.11; <i>p</i> = 0.001), greater stiffness (Beta: -0.24; 95% CI, -0.38, -0.09; <i>p</i> = 0.002) and greater loss of function (Beta: -0.27; 95% CI, -0.41, -0.14; <i>p</i> < 0.001).The results indicated that the severity of flattening is significantly associated with symptoms of knee OA. For the conservative management of knee OA, both flatfoot and its severity should be carefully considered.","['FTA', 'KL grade', 'flatfoot', 'knee function', 'knee osteoarthritis', 'knee pain', 'knee stiffness']"
A Control Study on the Value of the Ultrasound Grayscale Ratio for the Differential Diagnosis of Thyroid Micropapillary Carcinoma and Micronodular Goiter in Two Medical Centers.,"To investigate the value of ultrasound gray-scale ratio (UGSR) for the differential diagnosis of papillary thyroid microcarcinoma (PTMC) and micronodular goiter (MNG) in two medical centers.Ultrasound images of 881 PTMCs from 785 patients and 744 MNGs from 687 patients in center A were retrospectively analyzed and compared with 243 PTMCs from 203 patients and 251 MNGs from 198 patients in center B. All cases were confirmed by surgery and histology. The grayscale values of thyroid lesions and surrounding normal tissues were measured, and the UGSR was calculated. The optimal UGSR threshold for identifying PTMCs and MNGs in two medical centers was determined by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the area under the curve (AUC), optimal UGSR threshold, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy were compared between the two medical centers.The UGSR values of PTMCs and MNGs in medical center A were 0.5537 (0.4699, 0.6515) and 0.8708 (0.7616, 1.0123) (Z = -27.691, <i>P</i> = 0), respectively, whereas those in medical center B were 0.5517 (0.4698, 0.6377) and 0.8539 (0.7366, 0.9929) (Z = -16.057, <i>P</i> = 0), respectively. The UGSR of PTMCs and MNGs did not differ significantly between the two medical centers (Z = -0.609, <i>P</i> = 0.543 and Z = -1.394, <i>P</i> = 0.163, respectively). The AUC, optimal UGSR threshold, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and accuracy of the two medical centers were 0.898 vs. 0.918, 0.7214 vs. 0.6911, 0.881 vs. 0.868, 0.817 vs. 0.833, 0.851 vs. 0.834, 0.853 vs. 0.867, and 0.852 vs. 0.850, respectively.UGSR can quantify the echo intensity of PTMCs and MNGs and is therefore valuable for the differential diagnosis of the two diseases. The diagnostic efficacy was consistent between the two medical centers.

Correlations between Basal Trace Minerals and Hormones in Middle and Long-Distance High-Level Male Runners.,"Several essential trace minerals play an important role in the endocrine system; however, toxic trace minerals have a disruptive effect. The aim of this research was to determine basal concentrations and the possible correlations between trace minerals in plasma and several plasma hormones in runners. Sixty high-level male endurance runners (21 ± 3 years; 1.77 ± 0.05 m; 64.97 ± 7.36 kg) participated in the present study. Plasma hormones were analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and plasma trace minerals were analyzed with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). Correlations and simple linear regression were used to assess the association between trace minerals and hormones. Plasma testosterone concentrations were inversely correlated with manganese (r = -0.543; β = -0.410; <i>p</i> < 0.01), selenium (r = -0.292; β = -0.024; <i>p</i> < 0.05), vanadium (r = -0.406; β = -1.278; <i>p</i> < 0.01), arsenic (r = -0.336; β = -0.142; <i>p</i> < 0.05), and lead (r = -0.385; β = -0.418; <i>p</i> < 0.01). Plasma luteinizing hormone (LH) levels were positively correlated with arsenic (r = 0.298; β = 0.327; <i>p</i> < 0.05) and cesium (r = 0.305; β = 2.272; <i>p</i> < 0.05), and negatively correlated with vanadium (r = -0.303; β = -2.467; <i>p</i> < 0.05). Moreover, cortisol concentrations showed significant positive correlations with cadmium (r = 0.291; β = 209.01; <i>p</i> < 0.05). Finally, insulin concentrations were inversely related to vanadium (r = -0.359; β = -3.982; <i>p</i> < 0.05). In conclusion, endurance runners living in areas with high environmental levels of toxic minerals should check their concentrations of anabolic hormones.","['LH', 'cortisol', 'insulin', 'runners', 'testosterone', 'trace mineral']"
Evaluation of a novel threonine source for nursery pig diets.,"Four hundred and eighty (PIC 337 X 1050, PIC Genus, Hendersonville, TN) pigs were used to evaluate a novel threonine source (ThrPro, CJ America Bio, Fort Dodge, IA) for nursery pigs from approximately 7 to 20 kg body weight (BW). After weaning, pigs were sorted by sex and fed a common diet for 1 wk. Upon completion of the first week, pigs were sorted into randomized complete blocks, equalized by weight, within 16 replications. Pigs were allocated to one of three dietary treatments: positive control (POS)-standard ileal digestible threonine-to-lysine ratio (SID; Thr:Lys) 0.60, negative control (NEG)-SID Thr:Lys ≤0.46, and alternative Thr source (TEST)-SID Thr:Lys 0.60. The alternative Thr source included fermentative biomass and was assumed to contain 75% Thr and a digestibility coefficient of 100% based on the manufacturer's specifications. All other nutrients met or exceeded the NRC recommendations. Growth and intake data were analyzed as repeated measures with a compound symmetry covariance structure using the MIXED procedure in SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC) with pen as the experimental unit. Treatment, phase, the interaction between treatment and phase, and block were included as fixed effects in the model. Differences in total removals were tested using Fisher's Exact Test of PROC FREQ. Results were considered significant at <i>P</i> ≤ 0.05 and considered a trend at <i>P</i> > 0.05 and <i>P</i> ≤ 0.10. During the first 14 d, pigs fed TEST had decreased gain-to-feed ratio (G:F; 0.77 vs. 0.80, <i>P</i> = 0.022) compared to POS and increased G:F (0.77 vs. 0.73, <i>P</i> < 0.001) compared to NEG. Over days 14-28, pigs fed TEST had similar G:F (0.71 vs. 0.70, <i>P</i> = 0.112) compared to POS and increased G:F (0.71 vs. 0.63, <i>P</i> < 0.001) compared to NEG. Overall (days 0-28), pigs fed TEST had similar average daily gain (ADG; 0.47 vs. 0.47 kg/d, <i>P</i> = 0.982) and G:F (0.76 vs. 0.74, <i>P</i> = 0.395) compared to POS and increased ADG (0.47 vs. 0.43 kg/d, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and G:F (0.76 vs. 0.67, <i>P</i> < 0.001) compared to NEG. The average daily feed intake was not significantly different across treatments for the entirety of the study. In conclusion, the replacement of crystalline L-Thr with a novel Thr source resulted in similar growth performance in nursery pigs from approximately 7 to 20 kg.","['nursery', 'pig', 'threonine']"
Effects of carbohydrate drinks ingestion on executive function in athletes: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Carbohydrates are often used as boosters for endurance and high-intensity exercise. However, it is unclear whether carbohydrate drinks intake before or during exercise can affect specific domains of cognitive function, such as Executive Function (EF).Following the guidance of PRISMA 2020, we searched six major databases including PubMed, WOS, SPORTDiscus, Cochrane, Embase, and Scopus. Outcomes were presented in the form of Reaction Time (RT), Accuracy (ACC), and Scores (Score) for performing EF tests. Effect sizes were calculated from the test results of EF and expressed as standardized mean differences (SMDs). After analyzing the overall results, we performed subgroup analyses based on the athletes' program characteristics.After retrieving a total of 5,355 articles, ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified and included in this review. The overall results showed that the intake of carbohydrate drinks before or during exercise did not have a significant effect on the reduction of EF after exercise (ACC (-0.05 [-0.27, 0.18]); RT (-0.18 [-0.45, 0.09]); Score (0.24 [-0.20, 0.68])). The subgroup analyses based on open skill sports and close skill sports also showed invalid results, but the results of RT ended up with different preference (ACC of open skill sports athletes (-0.10 [-0.34, 0.14]); RT of open skill athletes (-0.27 [-0.60, 0.07]); RT of close skill athletes (0.29 [-0.24, 0.82])).The intake of 6-12% of single or mixed carbohydrates before or during exercise was not significantly effective in reducing the decline in EF after exercise. Our findings may have been influenced by the type of intervention, dose, mode of administration, or individual variability of the included subjects.","['athletes', 'carbohydrates', 'cognition', 'executive function', 'exercise', 'sugars']"
Accuracy of Self-Estimated BMI in the Context of Telephone Assessment Before Elective General Surgery.,"Background This study aimed to determine if self-estimated body mass index (BMI) from telephone consultation was accurate and useful for surgical planning prior to elective general surgery. Methods A prospective cohort study was performed under a single surgeon at a district general hospital in the United Kingdom. Estimated BMI was collected from consecutive patients attending a pre-operative telephone consultation. Actual BMI was measured on the day of surgery and compared. Patient age and gender were also collected. Results Data were collected from 124 participants (median age 59 years, 49.2% male). A total of 33 participants under-estimated, 53 over-estimated, and 38 accurately estimated their BMIs. The median change in BMI was 0.0 (IQR -0.1, 0.3, p = 0.003). The median change in males was 0.0 (-0.1, 0.2, p = 0.479) compared to 0.1 (0.0, 0.7, p = 0.002) in females. Those with an actual BMI > 29.9 had a significantly higher median change (0.2 {0.0, 1.1}) compared to those with BMI ≤ 29.9 (0.0 {-0.2, 0.1}; p <0.001). Only two patients could have required a change in surgeon on the day of the procedure and this was not statistically significant (p = 0.500). Conclusions Self-estimated BMI, collected via telephone consultation, is a suitable method for assessing patients for surgical planning ahead of elective general surgery procedures, particularly for males. However, it is important to be aware that those with higher BMIs, particularly females, may underestimate their BMIs.","['bmi', 'body mass index', 'covid19', 'preoperative planning', 'telemedicine']"
Effectiveness of a tailored communication intervention on colonoscopy uptake for firstdegree relatives of colorectal cancer patients: A randomized controlled trial.,"To evaluate the effect of a WeChat tailored communication intervention on colonoscopy uptake and health beliefs in Chinese first-degree relatives (FDRs) of colorectal cancer patients.This study employed a single-blinded randomized controlled trial. A total of 188 eligible FDRs were recruited and randomly assigned to the tailored intervention group or control group. Health beliefs were assessed at 1 (T1) and 3 months (T2) postintervention. The colonoscopy uptake was verified by medical records at T2. Data were analyzed using binary logistic regression and generalized estimating equation models.Compared with the participants in the control group, those in the intervention group had a significant improvement in terms of colonoscopy uptake (OR = 2.752, 95% CI: 1.428-5.303, <i>P</i> ​< ​0.01), perceived susceptibility (T1: β ​= ​0.298, 95% CI: ​0.052-0.402, <i>P</i> ​< ​0.05; T2: β ​= ​0.251, 95% CI: ​0.078-0.424, <i>P</i> ​< ​0.001) and cues to action (T1: β ​= ​0.0.264, 95% CI: ​0.138-0.389, <i>P</i> ​< ​0.001; T2: β ​= ​0.327, 95% CI: ​0.195-0.459, <i>P</i> ​< ​0.001) and a significant reduction in perceived barriers (T1: β ​= ​-0.237, 95% CI: ​-0.360-0.115, <i>P</i> ​< ​0.01; T2: β ​= ​-0.196, 95% CI: ​-0.331-0.062, <i>P</i> ​< ​0.01).This study broadens the application of tailored communication using novel channels in the context of screening in the at-risk Chinese population. The results provide insights on how to improve the intervention by modifying its components and communication channels.","['Colonoscopy', 'Colorectal cancer', 'Communication', 'Firstdegree relatives', 'Mobile application', 'Screening']"
Sociodemographic and Clinical Factors That Influence Oral Health-Related Quality of Life in Adolescents: a Cohort Study.,"To determine the sociodemographic and clinical factors that may influence oral health-related quality of life (OHRQoL) at ages 12 to 15.Cohort study.Cluster-randomized sample of Hong Kong 12-year-olds.The Child Perceptions Questionnaire (CPQ11-14) was used to measure OHRQoL as the response variable. Periodontal status and caries were examined according to WHO criteria. Malocclusion was assessed using Dental Aesthetic Index. Potential predictors of OHRQoL (age, gender, father's education, mother's education, household income, periodontal status, caries, and malocclusion) were analyzed by structural equation modelling.At age 12, 589 participants (305 females, 284 males) were included. At age 15, 331 (172 females and 159 males) were followed up. For direct effects, age 15 was associated with higher oral symptoms (OS) scores (β=0.124, 95%CI=0.049 to 0.2) but lower emotional well-being (EWB) scores (β=-0.105, 95%CI=-0.184 to -0.03). Males had higher OS scores than females (β=0.126, 95%CI=0.059 to 0.208). Mother's education had positive effects on children's EWB (β=-0.096, 95%CI=-0.159 to -0.018). Malocclusion had negative effects on functional limitations (FL) (β=0.083, 95%CI=0.013 to 0.186). For indirect effect, mother's education showed a link via EWB to OHRQoL (β=-0.077, 95%CI=-0.123 to -0.018). Malocclusion showed a link via FL to OHRQoL (β=0.037, 95%CI=0.006 to 0.087).Age, gender, mother's education and malocclusion predicted OHRQoL at ages 12 and 15.","['adolescents', 'oral healthrelated quality of life']"
Depression and state anxiety scores during assisted reproductive treatment are associated with outcome: a meta-analysis.,"This meta-analysis investigated whether state anxiety and depression scores during assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatment and changes in state anxiety and depression scores between baseline and during ART treatment are associated with treatment outcome. PubMed, PsycInfo, Embase, ScienceDirect, Web of Science and Scopus were searched and meta-analytic data analysed using random effects models to estimate standardized mean differences. Eleven studies (2202 patients) were included. Women who achieved pregnancy had significantly lower depression scores during treatment than women who did not become pregnant (-0.302; 95% CI: -0.551 to -0.054, z = -2.387, P = 0.017; I<sup>2</sup> = 77.142%, P = 0.001). State anxiety scores were also lower in women who became pregnant (-0.335; 95% CI: -0.582 to -0.087, z = -2.649, P = 0.008; I<sup>2</sup> = 81.339%, P = 0.001). However, changes in state anxiety (d = -0.056; 95% CI: -0.195 to 0.082, z = -0.794; I<sup>2</sup> = 0.00%) and depression scores (d = -0.106; 95% CI: -0.296 to 0.085, z = -1.088; I<sup>2</sup> = 0.00%) from baseline to treatment were not associated with ART outcome. Clinics should aim to promote better psychosocial care to help patients manage the psychological and physical demands of ART treatment, giving realistic expectations.","['Anxiety', 'Assisted reproductive technology', 'Depression', 'Infertility', 'Psychology']"
Agreements' profile of Scheimpflug-based optical biometer with gold standard partial coherence interferometry.,"To determine the agreement of ocular biometric indices including axial length, keratometric readings, anterior chamber depth, and horizontal corneal diameter between the Pentacam AXL and IOL Master 500.The study was a large cross-sectional population-based study (Tehran Geriatric Eye Study) conducted from Jan 2019 to Jan 2020. A total of 160 clusters were randomly selected proportional to size (each cluster contained 20 individuals) from 22 strata of Tehran city. All people aged 60y and above were invited to participate in the study. For all participants, preliminary ocular examinations were performed including the measurement of uncorrected and best-corrected visual acuity, objective and subjective refraction, anterior and posterior segment examinations. All participants underwent an ocular biometry using the Pentacam AXL and IOL Master 500.The 95% limits of agreement (LoA) between the two devices were -0.13 to 0.19, -0.15 to 0.17, and -0.13 to 0.19 in normal, pseudophakic, and cataractous eyes, respectively. With increasing the axial length, the difference between the two devices significantly increased in all three groups of normal, pseudophakic, and cataractous eyes (<i>P</i><0.001). The 95% LoAs between the two devices regarding the mean keratometry shows that the best LoAs were seen in cataractous (-0.33 to 0.81) and followed by normal eyes (-0.36 to 0.86) and the pseudophakic eyes (-0.48 to 0.90) had the widest LoA. The 95% LoAs for horizontal corneal diameter measurements were -0.08 to 0.86, -0.03 to 0.83, and -0.07 to 0.87 in normal, pseudophakic, and cataractous eyes, respectively. The 95% LoAs of anterior chamber depth measurements between the two devices was -0.39 to 0.19 and -0.37 to 0.13 in normal eyes and cataractous, respectively.The Pentacam AXL has excellent agreement with the gold standard, IOL Master 500 in measuring axial length. In eyes with cataracts, the difference between the two devices is more scattered. With the increasing of axial length, the difference between the two devices increased, which should be considered when using Pentacam AXL.","['Pentacam AXL', 'ocular biometry', 'optical biometer']"
Positive influence of managing cancer and living meaningfully (CALM) on fear of cancer recurrence in breast cancer survivors.,"To evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of managing cancer and living meaningfully (CALM), an intervention used to reduce the fear of cancer recurrence (FCR) in breast cancer survivors and improve their quality of life (QoL). A total of 103 breast cancer survivors were enrolled. Participants were randomly assigned to the CALM group or the care as usual (CAU) group. The participants completed a survey at baseline (T0) and after two (T1), four (T2), and six (T3) intervention sessions. The patients were assessed using the Cancer Worry Scale (CWS), Psychological Distress Thermometer (DT), Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Breast (FACT-B) and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). After the intervention, the CALM group showed a significant decrease in levels of FCR, distress, anxiety, and depression (χ<sup>2</sup>=154.353, χ<sup>2</sup>=130.292, χ<sup>2</sup>=148.879, and χ<sup>2</sup>=78.681; P<0.001, 0.001, 0.001, and 0.001, respectively) and an increased QoL (χ<sup>2</sup>=122.822, P<0.001). Compared with the CAU group, the CALM group showed significant differences in FCR, distress, QoL, anxiety and depression (F=292.431, F=344.156, F=11.115, F=45.124, and F=16.155; P<0.001, P<0.001, P=0.01, P<0.001, and P<0.001, respectively). Negative correlations were found between CWS and FACT-B scores in the CALM group (T0: r=-0.6345, P<0.001; T1: r=-0.4127, P=0.0017; T2: r=-0.2919, P=0.0306; and T3: r=-0.3188, P=0.0177) and in the CAU group (T0: r=-0.7714, P<0.0001; T1: r=-0.6549, P<0.0001; T2: r=-0.5060, P=0.0002; and T3: r=-0.3151, P=0.0291). Thus, the CALM intervention reduced FCR, distress, anxiety and depression in breast cancer survivors and improved QoL.","['Breast cancer', 'CALM intervention', 'fear of cancer recurrence', 'quality of life']"
The association between hip/groin pain and hip strength in football players: An exploratory analysis of the FORCe cohort.,"Explore associations between peak hip strength in football players with hip/groin pain and healthy controls.Cross-sectional study.Male and female sub-elite football players (soccer and Australian football) with hip/groin pain >6-month duration and players without hip/groin pain were recruited across Melbourne and Brisbane, Australia. Demographic information and two questionnaires; the Copenhagen Hip and Groin Outcome Score and the International Hip Outcome Tool 33 were collected. Hand-held dynamometry was used to measure isometric hip strength for flexion, extension, abduction, adduction, internal rotation, and external rotation. Linear mixed effects models were used to compare strength measures between groups.190 football players with hip/groin pain (mean ± standard deviation age, 27.8 ± 6.3 years) and 64 controls (age, 27.3 ± 5.6 years) were included in this study. Of these, 291 symptomatic limbs and 128 control limbs were used for analyses. Symptomatic players had lower peak hip adduction (adjusted mean difference = -0.18: 95 % confidence interval -0.27 to -0.08, P : 0.001), external rotation (-0.06: 95 % confidence interval -0.09 to -0.02, P : 0.003), and internal rotation strength (-0.06: 95 % confidence interval -0.10 to -0.03, P : 0.001) compared to controls. A sport-specific interaction was observed for hip abduction strength. When separated by football code, abduction strength was lower in symptomatic Australian football players compared to their same sport peers (-0.20: 95 % confidence interval -0.33 to -0.06, P : 0.004), but not in symptomatic soccer players (-0.05: 95 % confidence interval -0.15 to 0.06, P : 0.382).Hip adduction, internal rotation, and external rotation strength appears lower in football players with hip/groin pain independent of sex and football code. Hip abduction strength was lower in symptomatic Australian football players but not in soccer players.","['Australian football', 'Groin', 'Hip', 'Muscle strength', 'Rehabilitation', 'Soccer']"
Applications of diffusion tensor imaging integrated with neuronavigation to prevent visual damage during tumor resection in the optic radiation area.,"Intracranial tumors involving the temporo-occipital lobe often compress or destroy the optic radiation (OpR), resulting in decreased visual function. The aim of this study is to explore the value of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography integrated with neuronavigation to prevent visual damage when resecting tumors involving the OpR and find potential factors affecting patients' visual function and quality of life (QOL).Our study is a cross-sectional study that included 28 patients with intracranial tumors in close morphological relationship with the OpR recruited between January 2020 and February 2022. The surgical incision and approach were preoperatively designed and adjusted according to the DTI tractography results and visual function scores. All patients underwent examinations of visual acuity (VA) and visual field index (VFI) and completed visual function and QOL scales at admission and 2 months after discharge. Logistic regression and linear regression analysis were conducted to evaluate clinical factors potentially affecting pre/postoperative OpR morphology, VA, VFI, visual function, and QOL.Lesion size was the main factor found to affect visual function (β = -0.74, 95%CI: -1.12~-0.36, P = 0.05), VA (left: β = -0.11, 95%CI: -0.14~-0.08, P < 0.001; right: β = -0.15, 95%CI: -0.17~-0.13, P < 0.001), and VFI (left: β = -0.11, 95%CI: -0.14~-0.08, P < 0.001; right: β = -0.14, 95%CI: -0.16~-0.12, P < 0.001). Lesion size, edema, and involvement of the lateral ventricle temporal horn were factors affecting OpR morphology and QOL. The 28 patients showed significantly improved VA, VFI, visual function, and QOL results (P < 0.05) 2 months after discharge.Combining DTI of OpR mapping and microscopic-based neuronavigation aided precise mapping and thus preservation of visual function in patients undergoing tumor resection. Potential clinical factors affecting patients' visual function and QOL scores were identified which are useful for assessing a patient's condition and predicting prognosis.","['diffusion tensor imaging', 'neuronavigation', 'optic radiation', 'tumor resection', 'visual function']"
Novel Beta-Lactam/Beta-Lactamase Plus Metronidazole vs Carbapenem for Complicated Intra-abdominal Infections: A Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAIs) remain a leading cause of death in surgical wards, in which antibiotic treatment is crucial. We aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors (BL/BLIs) in combination with metronidazole and carbapenems in the treatment of cIAIs.A comprehensive search of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was performed using Medline, Embase, and Cochrane Library, which compared the efficacy and safety of novel BL/BLIs and carbapenems for the treatment of cIAIs.Six RCTs consisting of 2254 patients were included. The meta-analysis showed that novel BL/BLIs in combination with metronidazole had a lower clinical success rate (risk difference [RD], -0.05; 95% CI, -0.07 to -0.02; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%) and a lower microbiological success rate (RD, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.08 to -0.00; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%). No difference was found between the 2 groups in incidence of adverse events (RD, 0.02; 95% CI, -0.01 to 0.06; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%), serious adverse events (SAEs; RD, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.02 to 0.03; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 0%), or mortality (RD, 0.01; 95% CI, -0.00 to 0.02). However, ceftazidime/avibactam had a higher risk of vomiting (RD, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.05; <i>I</i> <sup>2</sup> = 47%), and the ceftolozane/tazobactam subgroup showed a higher incidence of SAEs (RD, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.03).The efficacy of novel BL/BLIs in combination with metronidazole was not as high as that of carbapenems. Although no significant differences were found with respect to overall adverse events, SAEs, or mortality, the novel BL/BLIs has a higher risk of vomiting. We still need to be cautious about the clinical application of a new anti-infective combination.PROSPERO ID: 42020166061.","['carbapenems', 'complicated intraabdominal infections', 'metaanalysis', 'βlactamβlactamase inhibitors']"
Efficacy and Safety of Intro-Arterial Chemotherapy Combined with Radiotherapy on Head and Neck Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"<b>Objectives</b>: Intro-arterial chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy (IACRT) for the treatment of head and neck cancer (HNC) underwent a revival in recent years. Although many clinical trials have reported favorable outcomes, the effect of IACRT for HNC is still controversial. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IACRT for HNC. <b>Methods</b>: The relevant articles published before August 2019 were searched from PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and PMC databases. Data were extracted and the combined complete response (CR), overall survival (OS) and toxicity incidence with 95% credible interval (CI) were examined from eligible studies. <b>Results</b>: Thirty-four studies comprising 1890 patients were included. IACRT achieved high CR (0.81, 95% CI: 0.76-0.86, <i>P</i> < 0.001), 3-year OS (0.75, 95% CI: 0.68-0.82, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and 5-year OS (0.68, 95% CI: 0.61-0.75, <i>P</i> < 0.001). The 3-year OS rate of stage III cancer (0.75, 95% CI: 0.53-0.97, <i>P</i>< 0.001) was higher than stage IV (0.52, 95% CI: 0.37-0.66, <i>P</i> = 0.025). Meanwhile, the 5-year OS of T3 cancer (0.87, 95% CI: 0.73-1.01, <i>P</i> = 0.028) was higher than T4 (0.53, 95% CI: 0.42-0.63, <i>P</i> = 0.286). Additionally, oral diseases, mucositis, leukopenia and dermatitis were the major toxicities of IACRT, which were all reversible. <b>Conclusion</b>: IACRT is an efficient and safe modality for HNC, which could achieve favorable cancer response and higher survival rate with acceptable toxicities, even for advanced HNC.","['complete response', 'head and neck cancer', 'introarterial chemoradiotherapy', 'overall survival', 'toxicity']"
The Effects of Curcumin on Weight Loss Among Patients With Metabolic Syndrome and Related Disorders: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.,"<b>Background and objective:</b> The current systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was carried out to assess the influence of curcumin intake on weight among patients with metabolic syndrome and related disorders. <b>Methods:</b> We searched the following databases up until January 2018: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. The relevant data were extracted and evaluated for quality of the studies in accordance with the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Data were pooled using the inverse variance method and expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). <b>Results:</b> Eighteen articles (21 studies) that comprised a total of 1,604 individuals were finally included in the meta-analysis. Curcumin intake significantly reduced body mass index (BMI) (SMD -0.37; 95% CI, -0.61, -0.13; <i>P</i> < 0.01), weight (SMD -0.23; 95% CI, -0.39, -0.06; <i>P</i> < 0.01), waist-circumference (WC) (SMD -0.25; 95% CI, -0.44, -0.05; <i>P</i> = 0.01), leptin levels (SMD -0.97; 95% CI, -1.18, -0.75; <i>P</i> < 0.001) and increased adiponectin levels (SMD 1.05; 95% CI, 0.23, 1.87; <i>P</i> = 0.01). We found no significant effect of curcumin intake on hip ratio (HR) (SMD -0.17; 95% CI, -0.42, 0.08; <i>P</i> = 0.18). <b>Conclusions:</b> Overall, we have found that curcumin intake among patients with metabolic syndrome and related disorders was correlated with a significant reduction in BMI, weight, WC, and leptin, and a significant increase in adiponectin levels, but did not affect HR.","['BMI', 'curcumin', 'leptin', 'metaanalysis', 'weight loss']"
Factors associated with gastric adenocarcinoma and dysplasia in patients with chronic gastritis: a population-based study.,"Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of death in China and other Asian countries. Recently, gastric endoscopy has become the main approach for GC screening, but the identification of high-risk individuals remains a challenge in GC screening programs.There were 7,302 patients with chronic gastritis involved in this study. Endoscopic examinations were performed, and their demographic characteristics and lifestyle data were collected. Each possible associated factor of GC/premalignant and precursor lesions was evaluated by univariate and multivariate logistic regressions. Nomograms were used for visualization of those models, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to present the predictive accuracy.We detected 8 (0.11%) gastric adenocarcinomas, 17 (0.23%) dysplasia cases, 14 (0.19%) hyperplasia cases, 52 (0.71%) intestinal metaplasia cases, 217 (2.97%) inflammatory lesions, 141 (1.93%) gastric ulcers, 10 (0.14%) atrophic gastritis cases, 1,365 (18.69%) erosive gastritis cases, and 5,957 (81.58%) superficial gastritis cases in 7,302 patients. The age (P<0.001), gender (P=0.086), labor intensity (P=0.018) and leek food intake (P=0.143) were identified as independent predictive factors of GC/premalignant lesions possibility. The corresponding nomogram exhibited an area under the curve (AUC) [95% confidence interval (95% CI)] of 0.82 (0.74-0.89) for the modeling group and 0.80 (0.75-0.85) for the validation group. The age (P=0.002), gender (P=0.024), smoking (P=0.002) and leek food intake (P=0.039) were independent predictive factors of precursor lesions possibility. The corresponding nomogram exhibited an AUC (95% CI) of 0.62 (0.60-0.65) for the modeling group and 0.61 (0.59-0.63) for the validation group.We identified several potential associated factors and provided a preclinical nomogram with the potential to predict the possibility of GC/premalignant and precursor lesions.","['GC', 'Risk', 'dysplasia', 'gastritis', 'populationbased study']"
Systematic review and meta-analysis of enhanced recovery programmes in gastric cancer surgery.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis was performed to determine the influence of enhanced recovery programmes (ERPs) on outcomes after gastric cancer surgery. Medline, Embase, the Cochrane library and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched for studies on outcomes of gastrectomy in enhanced recovery or fast-track programmes. The primary outcome measure was post-operative duration of hospital stay (LOHS), and secondary outcome measures were selected based inclusion in two or more studies. Statistical analysis was performed using standardized mean difference (SMD) and odds ratio (OR) as the summary statistics. Fourteen studies, totalling 1676 patients with gastric cancer were analysed, including nine randomized trials. LOHS was significantly shorter after ERP when compared with control patients (CON, SMD -1.10, 95% confidence interval -1.56 to -0.65, p < 0.001), but with significant heterogeneity between studies (I(2) = 93%, p < 0.001). ERP was also associated with reduced serum inflammatory response (CRP: SMD -0.68 (-1.16 to -0.19), p = 0.007; IL-6: SMD -0.62 (-0.94 to -0.29), p < 0.001), less weight loss (SMD -0.79 (-1.11 to -0.46), p < 0.001), and lower cost (SMD -1.02 (-1.59 to -0.45), p < 0.001), as well as a trend toward shorter duration of intravenous infusion (SMD -2.70 (-5.35 to -0.05), p = 0.05). Inclusion in an ERP was not associated with increased post-operative morbidity (OR 0.83 (0.65 to 1.06), p = 0.13) or hospital readmission (OR 1.67 (0.88 to 3.19), p = 0.12). From this review the authors concluded that multimodal, standardized perioperative gastrectomy care appears feasible, safe and cost effective.","['Enhanced recovery', 'Fast track surgery', 'Gastric cancer', 'Metaanalysis', 'Perioperative care']"
Targeted proteomics and metabolomics for biomarker discovery in abdominal aortic aneurysm and post-EVAR sac volume.,"Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) patients undergo uniform surveillance programs both leading up to, and following surgery. Circulating biomarkers could play a pivotal role in individualizing surveillance. We applied a multi-omics approach to identify relevant biomarkers and gain pathophysiological insights.In this cross-sectional study, 108 AAA patients and 200 post-endovascular aneurysm repair (post-EVAR) patients were separately investigated. We performed partial least squares regression and ingenuity pathway analysis on circulating concentrations of 96 proteins (92 Olink Cardiovascular-III panel, 4 ELISA-assays) and 199 metabolites (measured by LC-TQMS), and their associations with CT-based AAA/sac volume.The median (25th-75th percentile) maximal diameter was 50.0 mm (46.0, 53.0) in the AAA group, and 55.4 mm (45.0, 64.2) in the post-EVAR group. Correcting for clinical characteristics in AAA patients, the aneurysm volume Z-score differed 0.068 (95 %CI: (0.042, 0.093)), 0.066 (0.047, 0.085) and -0.051 (-0.064, -0.038) per Z-score valine, leucine and uPA, respectively. After correcting for clinical characteristics and orthogonalization in the post-EVAR group, the sac volume Z-score differed 0.049 (0.034, 0.063) per Z-score TIMP-4, -0.050 (-0.064, -0.037) per Z-score LDL-receptor, -0.051 (-0.062, -0.040) per Z-score 1-OG/2-OG and -0.056 (-0.066, -0.045) per Z-score 1-LG/2-LG.The branched-chain amino acids and uPA were related to AAA volume. For post-EVAR patients, LDL-receptor, monoacylglycerols and TIMP-4 are potential biomarkers for sac volume. Additionally, distinct markers for sac change were identified.","['Abdominal aortic aneurysm', 'Biomarkers', 'EVAR', 'Multiomics', 'Volume']"
"Impact of Correcting Nutritional Deficiency Anemias in the Elderly on Hospitalizations, Falls, and Mortalities.","The incidence and prevalence of anemia increase with age, particularly in adults older than 65 years, and it is associated with a number of adverse health outcomes (AHO), particularly hospitalizations, falls and mortalities. Given that approximately one-third of these anemias are due to reversible causes, we studied whether the treatment of nutritional deficiency anemia (NDA), namely iron deficiency anemia (IDA), cobalamin deficiency anemia (CDA), and folate deficiency anemia (FDA), improves AHO; and explored whether each NDA had different AHO.We reviewed electronic medical records of our internal medicine office patients aged 65 years or older, who had a diagnosis of anemia in a non-acute setting.Total 600 patients were included. Mean age was 75.2 years. Thirty-one point three percent had NDA (CDA 15.3%, IDA 12.3%, FDA 3.7%); and 68.7% had other anemias whom we categorized as non-nutritional deficiency anemias (NNDA), which included anemia of chronic disease (11.2%), myelodysplastic syndrome (6.2%), renal insufficiency anemia (5.7%) and unexplained anemia (45.6%). Even after adequate treatment, IDA group had significantly more hospitalizations (median, 25th - 75th: 2 (0 - 4) vs. 0 (0 - 1), P < 0.001), falls (median, 25th - 75th: 1 (0 - 3) vs. 0 (0 - 1), P < 0.001) and mortalities (10.8% vs. 3.4%, P = 0.011); CDA group had significantly more hospitalizations (median, 25th - 75th: 1 (0 - 2) vs. 0 (0 - 1), P = 0.007), but no difference in falls (median, 25th - 75th: 0 (0 - 1) vs. 0 (0 - 1), P = 0.171) and mortalities (7.6% vs. 3.4%, P = 0.083); and FDA group had significantly more hospitalizations (median, 25th - 75th: 1 (0 - 2) vs. 0 (0 - 1), P = 0.001), but no difference in falls (median, 25th - 75th: 0 (0 - 1) vs. 0 (0 - 1), P = 0.615) and mortalities (4.5% vs. 3.4%, P = 0.550), compared to the NNDA group. Age, Black race, higher number of comorbidities, presence of malignancy and use of direct oral anticoagulants were associated with increased odds of AHO in patients with NDA.Compared to the patients with NNDA, patients with IDA had more hospitalizations, falls and mortalities even after adequate treatment; while patients with CDA and FDA had only more hospitalizations. Adequate treatment mitigated falls and mortalities in elderly patients with CDA and FDA.","['Anemia', 'Cobalamin deficiency', 'Elderly', 'Folate deficiency', 'Iron deficiency', 'Nutritional deficiency anemias', 'Vitamin B12 deficiency']"
Effect of dietary vitamin C on gastric cancer risk in the Korean population.,"To investigate the effects of dietary vitamin C and foods containing vitamin C on gastric cancer risk.Our study included 830 control subjects and 415 patients. Data regarding demographics, medical history, and lifestyle, including dietary and nutrient intake, were collected using reliable self-administered questionnaires. Dietary intake information was collected from the participants using a food frequency questionnaire that has been previously reported as reliable and valid. A rapid urease test and a histological evaluation were used to determine the presence of Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection. Twenty-three vitamin C-contributing foods were selected, representing over 80% of the cumulative vitamin C contribution.In analyses adjusted for first-degree family history of gastric cancer, education level, job, household income, smoking status, and regular exercise, an inverse association between vitamin C intake and gastric cancer risk was observed for the highest (≥ 120.67 mg/d) vs the lowest (< 80.14 mg/d) intake category [OR (95%CI): 0.64 (0.46-0.88)], with a significant trend across the three intake categories (P = 0.007). No protective effect of vitamin C was detected after stratification by gender. No effect of vitamin C intake on the gastric cancer incidence was found in either men or women infected with H. pylori. Vitamin C-contributing foods, including cabbage [0.45 (0.32-0.63), 0.50 (0.34-0.75), 0.45 (0.25-0.81)], strawberries [0.56 (0.40-0.78), 0.49 (0.32-0.74), 0.52 (0.29-0.93)], and bananas [0.40 (0.29-0.57), 0.41 (0.27-0.62), 0.34 (0.19-0.63)], were protective factors against the risk of gastric cancer based on the results of the overall adjusted analyses and the results for men and women, respectively.A protective effect of vitamin C and vitamin C-contributing foods against gastric cancer was observed. Further studies using larger sample sizes are required to replicate our results.","['Gastric cancer', 'Helicobacter pylori', 'Korean population', 'Vitamin C', 'Vitamin Ccontributing foods']"
Assessment of cardiopulmonary manifestations and its correlation with semi-quantitative scoring of high-resolution computed tomography in patients with autoimmune rheumatic diseases.,"Autoimmune rheumatic diseases (ARD) are groups of diseases that are commonly associated with cardiac and pulmonary manifestations and may affect the morbidity and mortality of the patients. The study aimed to the assessment of cardiopulmonary manifestations and their correlation with the semi-quantitative scoring of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in ARD patients.30 patients with ARD were included in the study (mean age 42.2 ± 9.76 years) [10 patients were scleroderma (SSc), 10 patients were rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and 10 patients were systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)]. They all met the diagnostic criteria of the American College of Rheumatology and underwent spirometry, echocardiography, and chest HRCT. The HRCT was assessed by a semi-quantitative score for parenchymal abnormalities. Correlation between HRCT lung scores and: inflammatory markers, lung volumes in spirometry, and echocardiographic indices has been performed.The total lung score (TLS) by HRCT was 14.8 ± 8.78 (mean ± SD), ground glass opacity score (GGO) was 7.20 ± 5.79 (mean ± SD) and fibrosis lung score (F) was 7.63 ± 6.05 (mean ± SD). TLS correlated significantly with ESR (r 0.528, p 0.003), CRP (r 0.439, p 0.015), PaO2 (r -0.395, P 0.031) FVC% (r -0.687, p 0.001), and echocardiographic Tricuspid E (r -0.370, p 0.044), Tricuspid E/è (r -0.397,p 0.03), ESPAP (r 0.459,p 0.011), TAPSE (r -0.405, p 0.027), MPI-TDI (r -0.428, p 0.018) and RV Global strain(r -0.567, p 0.001). GGO score correlated significantly with ESR (r 0.597, p 0.001), CRP (r 0.473, p 0.008), FVC% (r -0.558, p 0.001), and RV Global strain(r -0.496, p 0.005). F score correlated significantly with FVC% (r -0.397, p 0.030), Tricuspid E/è (r -0.445, p 0.014), ESPAP (r 0.402, p 0.028), and MPI-TDI (r -0.448, p 0.013).The total lung score and GGO score in ARD were found to be consistently significantly correlated with FVC% predicted, PaO2, inflammatory markers, and RV functions. Fibrotic score correlated with ESPAP. Therefore, in a clinical setting, most clinicians who monitor patients suffering from ARD should concern with the applicability of semiquantitative HRCT scoring in clinical practice.","['Autoimmune rheumatic diseases', 'Echocardiography', 'HRCT', 'Semiquantitative score']"
Posterior Protrusion Measures (PPM) as an Innovative Index in Classifying Plain Lateral Radiograph Images of Pertrochanteric Fracture Using the Revised AO Foundation/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA) Classification.,"Introduction The absence of a precise fracture classification system that classifies pertrochanteric fractures into either stable or unstable contributes to a burden on healthcare and has several major implications. We propose an innovative graphical index, which we refer to as posterior protrusion measures (PPM), using plain lateral view radiograph images for the revised AO Foundation (Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesesfragen)/Orthopedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA) classiﬁcation system. This study aims to: (i) introduce the use of PPM for classifying fractures into stable or unstable under the revised AO/OTA classification system and set the threshold numeric value, (ii) elucidate the reproducibility of inter and intra-observer agreement, and investigate the consistency of fracture classification using PPM versus computed tomography (CT) scan images. Materials and methods Out of 146 patients identified from the database, a total of 126 patients were enrolled in the study. Pertrochanteric fractures were classified as either stable or unstable. Three surgeons were assigned for PPM determination. Regarding the demographical data, the chi-square test was used to assess the significance of each parameter on a categorical scale between the two groups. The independent sample t-test or the Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare the two independent groups. Interclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values for continuous variables and kappa values (κ) for categorical variables were calculated to assess inter-observer and intra-observer agreement. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to determine optimal cut-off points of PPM to predict consistency between separate fracture classification groups, one using PPM values with a threshold derived from plain radiograph images, and the other using CT scan images. Results Among a total of 126 pertrochanteric fractures, the A1 (stable) group consisted of 39 patients (10 males, 29 females), whereas the A2 (unstable) group consisted of 87 patients (14 males, 73 females) (not significant, NS). Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values of PPM for the inter-observer agreement were 0.796 (0.723-0.852), 0.664 (0.554-0.751), and 0.702 (0.601-0.781) at first examination and 0.729 (0.635-0.801) at the second. The intra-observer agreement was 0.869 (0.819-0.906) and 0.603 (0.480-0.703). We examined for consistency of fracture classification group of PPM values with a threshold of 0.4 (A1<0.4, A2=0.4 or more) and CT-based group. For the first examination, there was mostly ""moderate"" agreement in fracture classification (stable or unstable) between plain radiograph and CT scan images, κ (95%CI): 0.427 (0.266-0.588), 0.493 (0.335-0.651), and 0.359 (0.176-0.544), and for the second, 0.418 (0.251-0.585), and 0.451 (0.284-0.620), respectively. Conclusion We propose a supplementary tool, namely PPM that allows for possible alternative classification of pertrochanteric fractures into A1 (stable) and A2 (unstable) using plain radiograph images under the revised AO/OTA classification system. In this study, a PPM threshold value of 0.4 demonstrated a moderate inter- and intra-observer agreement. It is noteworthy to mention that there was a satisfactory consistency of fracture classification using PPM derived from plain radiograph images when compared to classification using CT scan images. In addition, the PPM method provides a numerical score.","['aoota classification', 'lateral view', 'pertrochanteric fracture', 'plain radiograph', 'posterior protrusion measures']"
The relationship between perceived organizational support and insomnia in Chinese nurses: The Serial multiple mediation analysis.,"Nurses are in high-pressure, high-load, and high-risk environment for a long time, and their insomnia cannot be ignored. Insomnia not only has a negative impact on the physical and mental health of nurses, but also on the efficiency and quality of nursing work.The purpose of this study was to investigate the multiple mediating effect of psychological capital, effort-reward ratio, and overcommitment in the relationship between perceived organizational support and insomnia among Chinese nurses.A cross-sectional study has been carried out in a tertiary grade A hospital in Shandong Province, China from March 2021 to May 2021. The demographic questionnaire, Perceived Organization Support Questionnaire, Psychological Capital Questionnaire, Chinese version Effort-Reward Imbalance, Questionnaire and Athens Insomnia Scale were used for data collection. SPSS PROCESS 3.4 macro program developed by Hayes was used to test the serial multiple mediation. Descriptive analysis, independent-samples <i>t</i>-test, one-way analysis of variance, Pearson's correlation analyses, ordinary least-squares regression, and the bootstrap method were used for data analysis.658 valid questionnaires were collected (81.2%). Nurses' perceived organizational support was positively correlated with psychological capital (<i>r</i> = 0.455, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and was significantly negatively correlated with effort-reward ratio (<i>r</i> = -0.318, <i>p</i> < 0.001), overcommitment (<i>r</i> = -0.328, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and insomnia (<i>r</i> = -0.358, <i>p</i> < 0.001); Psychological capital was negatively correlated with effort-reward ratio (r = -0.275, <i>p</i> < 0.001), overcommitment (<i>r</i> = -0.339, <i>p</i> < 0.001), and insomnia (<i>r</i> = -0.402, <i>p</i> < 0.001), respectively; effort-reward ratio and overcommitment were significantly positively correlated with insomnia (<i>r</i> = 0.379, <i>p</i> < 0.001; <i>r</i> = 0.466, <i>p</i> < 0.001), respectively. In the model of perceived organizational support-psychological capital-effort-reward ratio-insomnia, the overall mediating effect was -0.080 (95%CI: -0.109 ~ -0.058), and the mediating effect of psychological capital was -0.050, accounting for 34.30% of the total effect; the mediating effect of effort-reward ratio was -0.024, accounting for 16.49% of the total effect; the chain mediating effect of psychological capital and effort-reward ratio was -0.007, accounting for 4.49% of the total effect. In the model of perceived organizational support-psychological capital-overcommitment-insomnia, the overall mediating effect was -0.085 (95%CI: -0.109 ~ -0.064), and the mediating effect of psychological capital was -0.042, accounting for 28.64% of the total effect; the mediating effect of overcommitment was -0.029, accounting for 19.81% of the total effect; the chain mediating effect of psychological capital and overcommitment was -0.015, accounting for 10.14% of the total effect.Perceived organizational support had direct negative influence on insomnia. Psychological capital and effort-reward ratio/overcommitment acted as chained mediating factor could partially relieve insomnia symptoms related to perceived organizational support. It is suggested to improve the level of organizational support and psychological capital of nurses, and reduce the effort-reward imbalance and overcommitment of nurses, so as to effectively decline and deal with nurses' insomnia.","['effortreward imbalance', 'insomnia symptoms', 'occupational stress', 'overcommitment', 'perceived organizational support', 'psychological capital']"
Circulating Growth Differentiation Factor 15 Is Associated with Diabetic Neuropathy.,"Background: Growth differentiation factor (GDF15) is a superfamily of transforming growth factor-beta which has been suggested to be correlated with various pathological conditions. The current study aimed to investigate the predicted role of circulating GDF15 in diabetic metabolism characteristics and diabetic neuropathy. Methods: 241 diabetic patients and 42 non-diabetic subjects were included to participate in the study. The plasma GDF15 levels were measured using ELISA. Chronic kidney disease and albuminuria were defined according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guideline. The nerve conductive study (NCS) was performed with measurement of distal latency, amplitude, nerve conduction velocity (NCV), H-reflex, and F-wave studies. Results: The diabetic group had a significantly higher prevalence of chronic kidney disease and higher plasma GDF15 level. After adjusting for age and BMI, GDF15 was significantly positively correlated with waist circumference (r = 0.332, p = <0.001), hip circumference (r = 0.339, p < 0.001), HbA1c (r = 0.302, p < 0.001), serum creatine (r = 0.146, p = 0.017), urine albumin/creatinine ratio (r = 0.126, p = 0.040), and HOMA-IR (r = 0.166, p = 0.007). As to NCS, GDF15 was significantly correlated with all latency and amplitude of sensory and motor nerves, as well as F-wave and H-reflex latencies. The area under the curve (AUC) in predicting tibial motor nerve neuropathy (MNCV) in all subjects and in the diabetic group for GDF15 was 0.646 (p = 0.001) and 0.610 (p = 0.012), respectively; for HbA1c was 0.639 (p = 0.001) and 0.604 (p = 0.018), respectively. Predicting ulnar sensory nerve neuropathy for GDF15 was 0.639 (p = 0.001) and 0.658 (p = 0.001), respectively; for HbA1c was 0.545 (p = 0.307) and 0.545 (p = 0.335), respectively. Predicting median sensory nerve neuropathy for GDF15 was 0.633 (p = 0.007) and 0.611 (p = 0.032), respectively; for HbA1c was 0.631 (p = 0.008) and 0.607 (p = 0.038), respectively. Predicting CKD for GDF15 was 0.709 (95% CI, 0.648−0.771), p < 0.001) and 0.676 (95% CI, 0.605−0.746), p < 0.001), respectively; for HbA1c was 0.560 (95% CI, 0.493−0.627); p = 0.080) and 0.515 (95% CI, 0.441−0.588); p = 0.697), respectively. Conclusions: We suggest that there is a significant association between the increased serum GDF-15 level and metabolic parameters and diabetic neuropathy. Plasma GDF15 may be an independent predictor of diabetic neuropathy.","['diabetic neuropathy', 'growth differentiation factor 15', 'nerve conductive study', 'type 2 DM']"
The effectiveness of psychosocial interventions at reducing the frequency of alcohol and drug use in parents: findings of a Cochrane Review and meta-analyses.,"Parental substance use is a major public health and safeguarding concern. There have been a number of trials examining interventions targeting this risk factor. We aimed to estimate the effectiveness of psychosocial interventions at reducing parental substance use.We used systematic methods to identify trials; pooling data using a random-effects model. Moderator analyses examined influence of parent gender, presence of child in treatment and intervention type.No restrictions on setting.Substance using parents of children below the age of 21 years.Psychosocial interventions including those that targeted drug and alcohol use only, and drug and alcohol use in combination with associated issues.Frequency of alcohol use and frequency of drug use.We included eight unique studies with a total of 703 participants. Psychosocial interventions were more effective at reducing the frequency of parental alcohol use than comparison conditions at 6-month [standardized mean difference (SMD) = - 0.32, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.51 to -0.13, P = 0.001] and 12-month follow-up (SMD = -0.25, 95% CI = -0.47 to -0.03, P = 0.02) and frequency of parental drug use at 12 months only (SMD = -0.21, 95% CI = -0.41 to -0.01, P = 0.04). Integrated interventions which combined both parenting and substance use targeted components were effective at reducing the frequency of alcohol use (6 months: SMD = -0.56, 95% CI = -0.96 to -0.016, P = 0.006; 12 months: SMD = -0.42, 95% CI = -0.82 to -0.03, P = 0.04) and drug use (6 months: SMD = -0.39, 95% CI = -0.75 to -0.03, P = 0.04; 12 months: SMD = -0.43, 95% CI = -0.80 to -0.07, P = 0.02). Interventions targeting only substance use or parenting skills were not effective at reducing frequency of alcohol or drug use at either time-point.Psychosocial interventions should target both parenting and substance use in an integrated intervention.","['alcohol', 'drugs', 'metaanalyses', 'parent', 'psychosocial intervention']"
Pre- to postdiagnosis leisure-time physical activity and prognosis in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.,"Physical activity (PA) before and after breast cancer diagnosis has been reported to be associated with lower mortality. However, whether changes in the activity after diagnosis impact prognosis is unclear and has not received much attention. This study aimed to examine pre- to postdiagnosis leisure-time PA and breast cancer prognosis.We used data from the MARIE study, a prospective population-based patient cohort study of 3813 postmenopausal breast cancer patients, aged 50-74 at diagnosis, recruited from 2002 to 2005, re-interviewed in 2009, and followed up until June 2015. Prediagnosis PA was assessed at recruitment; postdiagnosis PA was assessed at re-interview in 2009. To examine pre- to postdiagnosis change in PA, women were categorized by pre- and postdiagnosis PA using a cut-off of 7.5 MET-h/week for meeting PA recommendations and combined into four groups: insufficiently active, increasingly active, decreasingly active, and sufficiently active. Cox regression models with delayed entry were used to assess associations between pre- to postdiagnosis patterns of PA and overall mortality (OM), breast cancer mortality (BCM), and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Additional analyses of pre- and postdiagnosis PA (no activity (reference), low activity, sufficient activity) with cancer outcomes, such as using a time-dependent model, were performed. In total, 2042 patients were included in the analyses.There were 206 deaths (114 from breast cancer) after a median follow-up time of 6.0 years after the 2009 interview. Compared to insufficiently active women, increasingly active women were at lower risk of OM, BCM, and RFS (HR (95%CI) of 0.50 (0.31-0.82), 0.54 (0.30-1.00), 0.58 (0.40-0.84), respectively). In sufficiently active women, associations for OM (0.75 (0.48-1.15)), BCM (0.61 (0.33-1.13)), and RFS 0.80 (0.57-1.14)) were similar to increasingly active women but attenuated, and decreasingly active women were not at lower risk for OM (0.91 (0.61-1.36)), BCM (0.80 (0.45-1.42)), and RFS (1.04 (0.76-1.43)). In time-dependent analyses, sufficient activity vs. no activity was associated with better OM (0.73 (0.57-0.93)), BCM (0.64 (0.46-0.89)), and RFS (0.82 (0.68-0.99)). Low activity was not significantly associated with prognosis.Our data support benefits for breast cancer prognosis in being physically active pre- and postdiagnosis particularly for women who were insufficiently active prediagnosis.","['Breast cancer', 'Physical activity', 'Postmenopausal', 'Prognosis', 'Survival']"
Neck circumference may be a valuable tool for screening individuals with obesity: findings from a young Chinese population and a meta-analysis.,"Central obesity and overweight/obesity can result in various chronic non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes mellitus. Waist circumference (WC) and body mass index (BMI) are widely used to measure obesity despite their limitations. For example, WC and BMI cannot be measured in pregnant women and subjects with abdominal ascites or masses. Therefore, this study aims to determine the efficacy of neck circumference (NC) as a tool for screening central obesity and overweight/obesity.A total of 1169 undergraduates aged 18-25 years were studied by a cross-sectional survey in China, 2016. Questionnaires and physical examinations were used to collect data. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to determine the best threshold of NC for screening central obesity and overweight/obesity. Meanwhile, a meta-analysis was conducted to estimate the efficacy of NC for screening central obesity and overweight/obesity synthetically.NC was moderately correlated with WC and BMI. The ROC analysis showed that 37.1 cm for male and 32.6 cm for female were the best thresholds for central obesity, and 37.4 cm and 32.2 cm for overweight/obesity, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity, area under receiver operating curve (AUC) of central obesity and overweight/obesity were higher. In the meta-analysis, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, AUC and their 95%CI of NC for screening central obesity were 0.72 (0.68~ 0.75), 0.87 (0.74~ 0.94), 0.77 (0.73~ 0.80) for male and 0.73 (0.65~ 0.80), 0.80 (0.71~ 0.86), 0.82 (0.79~ 0.86) for female. For overweight/obesity, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, AUC and corresponding 95%CI were 0.83 (0.70~ 0.91), 0.77 (0.66~ 0.85), 0.86 (0.83~ 0.89) for male and 0.82 (0.71~ 0.90), 0.84 (0.61~ 0.95), 0.89 (0.86~ 0.92) for female.NC may not be a good tool for screening individuals with central obesity. But it may be a simple and valuable tool for screening individuals with overweight/obesity, especially in females.","['Central obesity', 'Neck circumference', 'Overweightobesity', 'Receiver operator characteristic curve']"
Accuracy of clinical neurological examination in diagnosing lumbo-sacral radiculopathy: a systematic literature review.,"Lumbar radiculopathy remains a clinical challenge among primary care clinicians in both assessment and diagnosis. This often leads to misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment of patients resulting in poor health outcomes, exacerbating this already debilitating condition. This review evaluated 12 primary diagnostic accuracy studies that specifically assessed the performance of various individual and grouped clinical neurological tests in detecting nerve root impingement, as established in the current literature.Eight electronic data bases were searched for relevant articles from inception until July 2016. All primary diagnostic studies which investigated the accuracy of clinical neurological test (s) in diagnosing lumbar radiculopathy among patients with low back and referred leg symptoms were screened for inclusion. Qualifying studies were retrieved and independently assessed for methodological quality using the 'Quality Assessment of Diagnostic tests Accuracy Studies' criteria.A total of 12 studies which investigated standard components of clinical neurological examination of (sensory, motor, tendon reflex and neuro-dynamics) of the lumbo-sacral spine were included. The mean inter-observer agreement on quality assessment by two independent reviewers was fair (k = 0.3 - 0.7). The diagnostic performance of sensory testing using MR imaging as a reference standard demonstrated a sensitivity (confidence interval 95%) 0.61 (0.47-0.73) and a specificity of 0.63 (0.38-0.84). Motor tests sensitivity was poor to moderate, ranging from 0.13 (0.04-0.31) to 0.61 (0.36-0.83). Generally, the diagnostic performance of reflex testing was notably good with specificity ranging from (confidence interval 95%) 0.60 (0.51-0.69) to 0.93 (0.87-0.97) and sensitivity ranging from 0.14 (0.09-0.21) to 0.67 (0.21-0.94). Femoral nerve stretch test had a high sensitivity of (confidence interval 95%) 1.00 (0.40-1.00) and specificity of 0.83 (0.52-0.98) while SLR test recorded a mean sensitivity of 0.84 (0.72-0.92) and specificity of 0.78 (0.67-0.87).There is a scarcity of studies on the diagnostic accuracy of clinical neurological examination testing. Furthermore there seem to be a disconnect among researchers regarding the diagnostic utility of lower limb neuro-dynamic tests which include the Straight Leg Raise and Femoral Nerve tests for sciatic and femoral nerve respectively. Whether these tests are able to detect the presence of disc herniation and subsequent nerve root compression or hyper-sensitivity of the sacral and femoral plexus due to mechanical irritation still remains debatable.","['Clinical neurological examination', 'Diagnostic accuracy', 'Lumbar radiculopathy']"
Risk Factors of Gastrointestinal Perforation with a Poor Prognosis.,"Despite medical progress, mortality from gastrointestinal perforation was relatively high. Our study's objective was to identify risk factors associated with a poor prognosis for gastrointestinal perforation.Patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal perforation at the Longchuan County People's Hospital between January 2019 and February 2022 were the subject of a retrospective analysis of their laboratory data. Patients were grouped based on length of hospital stay, septic shock, and mortality.A total of 240 patients participated in our study. Using univariate and multivariate analysis, we identified several risk factors for gastrointestinal perforation associated with a dismal prognosis. Lower digestive tract perforation (OR=2.418, 95% CI 1.119-5.227, P=0.025), low total protein (OR=0.934, 95% CI 0.879-0.992, P=0.026) and low hemoglobin (OR=0.985, 95% CI 0.971-0.999, P=0.039) were linked to a longer length of stay, especially hemoglobin (OR=0.978, 95% CI 0.966-0.991, P=0.001) in upper digestive tract. High ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes (NLR) (OR=1.043, 95% CI 1.012-1.076, P=0.007), high lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR) (OR=2.158, 95% CI 1.495-3.115, P<0.001) and low prognostic nutrition index (PNI) (OR=0.814, 95% CI 0.751-0.833, P<0.001) predicted septic shock. In upper digestive tract, PLR (OR=1.001, 95% CI 1.000-1.002, P=0.067), LMR (OR=2.160, 95% CI 1.440-3.240, P<0.001) and PNI (OR=0.843, 95% CI 0.767-0.926, P<0.001) were risk factors for septic shock, and total protein (OR=0.796, 95% CI 0.686-0.923, P=0.003) was a risk factor for septic shock in lower digestive tract. High NLR (OR=1.056, 95% CI 1.019-1.093, P=0.003), high LMR (OR=1.760, 95% CI 1.177-2.632, P=0.006) and low PNI (OR=0.832, 95% CI 0.754-0.918, P<0.001) were the risk factors of mortality. In subgroup analysis of perforation site, albumin (OR=0.820, 95% CI 0.719-0.934, P=0.003) and LMR (OR=1.506, 95% CI 1.069-2.123, P=0.019) were risk factors for mortality in upper digestive tract and PNI (OR=0.636, 95% CI 0.445-0.908, P=0.013) was a risk factor for mortality in lower digestive tract.Our research found that the perforation site, total protein, albumin, hemoglobin, NLR, LMR, PLR and PNI were risk factors for gastrointestinal perforation with a poor prognosis.","['gastrointestinal perforation', 'length of stay', 'mortality', 'prognosis', 'septic shock']"
Pre-Weaned Calf Rearing on Northern Irish Dairy Farms-Part 2: The Impact of Hygiene Practice on Bacterial Levels in Dairy Calf Rearing Environments.,"Pre-weaned dairy calves are very susceptible to disease in the first months of life due to having a naïve immune system and because of the numerous physiological stressors they face. Hygiene management is a key element in minimizing enteric disease risk in calves by reducing their exposure to pathogens. Samples of milk, concentrate feed and drinking water, boot swabs of bedding and swabs of feed equipment were collected from 66 dairy farms as part of a survey of calf rearing practice and housing design. All the samples were cultured to determine total viable counts (TVC), total coliforms (TCC) and <i>Escherichia coli</i> as indicators of hygiene. Target ranges for levels of TVC, TCC and <i>E. coli</i> were defined from the literature and the sample results compared against them. The TVC targets in milk, MR and water were <4.0 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/mL. TCC and <i>E. coli</i> targets of <1.1 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/mL (the detection limit) were used for milk, MR, concentrate feed and feeding equipment. For water, the TCC and <i>E. coli</i> targets were <1.0 log<sub>10</sub> CFU/100 mL. The targets used for bedding boot swabs were <6.3 log<sub>10</sub> TVC CFU/mL and <5.7 log<sub>10</sub> TCC or <i>E. coli</i> CFU/mL. Farm management factors were included as fixed effects in a generalized linear mixed model to determine the probability of samples being within each hygiene indicator target range. Milk replacer samples obtained from automatic feeders were more likely to be within the TVC target range (0.63 probability) than those prepared manually (0.34) or milk samples taken from the bulk tank (0.23). Concentrate feed samples taken from buckets in single-calf pens were more likely to have <i>E. coli</i> detected (0.89) than samples taken from group pen troughs (0.97). A very small proportion of water samples were within the indicator targets (TVC 9.8%, TCC 6.0%, <i>E. coli</i> 10.2%). Water from self-fill drinkers had a lower likelihood of being within the TVC target (0.03) than manually filled buckets (0.14), and water samples from single pens were more likely to be within TCC target ranges (0.12) than those from group pens (0.03). However, all self-fill drinkers were located in group pens so these results are likely confounded. Where milk feeders were cleaned after every feed, there was a greater likelihood of being within the TVC target range (0.47, compared with 0.23 when not cleaned after every feed). Detection of coliforms in milk replacer mixing utensils was linked with reduced probability of TVC (0.17, compared with 0.43 when coliforms were not detected) and TCC (0.38, compared with 0.62), which was within target in feeders. Key factors related to increased probability of bedding samples being within TCC target range were use of group calf pens (0.96) rather than single-calf pens (0.80), use of solid floors (0.96, compared with 0.76 for permeable floors) and increased space allowance of calves (0.94 for pens with ≥2 m<sup>2</sup>/calf, compared with 0.79 for pens with <2 m<sup>2</sup>/calf). Bedding TVC was more likely to be within the target range in group (0.84) rather than in single pens (0.66). The results show that hygiene levels in the calf rearing environment vary across farms and that management and housing design impact hygiene.","['bedding', 'enteric disease', 'feeding equipment', 'housing', 'management', 'space allowance']"
SGLT2 inhibitors for prevention of primary and secondary cardiovascular outcomes: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.,"Many clinical studies have shown that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) reduce cardiovascular risks, such as heart failure, myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death.To investigate the use of SGLT2i for the prevention of primary and secondary cardiovascular outcomes.Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane libraries databases were searched and meta-analysis was performed using Revman 5.4.Eleven studies with a total of 34,058 cases were analyzed. SGLT2i significantly reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI) (OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73-0.94, p = 0.004), no prior MI (OR 0. 82, 95% CI 0.74-0.90, p<0.0001), prior coronary atherosclerotic disease (CAD) (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73-0.93, p = 0.001) and no prior CAD (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.76-0.91, p = 0.0002) compared with placebo. In addition, SGLT2i significantly reduced hospitalization due to heart failure (HF) in patients with prior MI (OR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55-0.87, p = 0.001), no prior MI (OR 0.63, 95% CI 0.55-0. 72, p<0.00001), prior CAD (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.53-0.79, p<0.0001) and no prior CAD (OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.56-0.75, p<0.00001) compared with placebo. SGLT2i reduced cardiovascular mortality and all-cause mortality events. MI (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.70-0.88, p<0.0001), renal damage (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.58-0.91, p = 0.004), all-cause hospitalization (OR 0.89, 95% CI 0.83-0.96, p = 0.002), systolic and diastolic blood pressure were all significantly reduced in patients receiving SGLT2i.SGLT2i was effective in prevention of primary and secondary cardiovascular outcomes.","['Cardiovascular death', 'Cardiovascular events', 'Metaanalysis', 'Myocardial infarction', 'SGLT2i']"
"Impact of cognitive behavior therapy on osteoarthritis-associated pain, insomnia, depression, fatigue, and physical function in patients with knee/hip osteoarthritis: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.","This meta-analysis aimed at evaluating the efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) against osteoarthritis-associated symptoms in patients with knee/hip osteoarthritis.Medline, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases were searched from inception to July 2022 to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing the efficacy of CBT with other treatment approaches in adults with confirmed knee/hip osteoarthritis. The pain intensity (primary outcome) and the secondary outcomes including insomnia severity, sleep efficiency, physical function as well as the severity of depression and fatigue were assessed at two time points (i.e., immediately after treatment and during the follow-up period). The effect size is expressed as standardized mean difference (SMD) with SMDs of < 0.2, 0.2-0.5, and 0.5-0.8, and > 0.8 representing negligible, small, medium, and large effect sizes, respectively.Fifteen RCTs were included for analysis. Immediately after CBT intervention, meta-analysis showed similar treatment effect in pain severity [SMD = -0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI): -0.95 to 0.04, 11 studies, 1557 participants] and other symptoms including depression (SMD = -0.26, 95% CI: -0.58 to 0.06, five studies, 735 participants), fatigue (SMD = -2.44, 95% CI:-6.53 to 1.65, two RCTs, 511 participants), and physical function (SMD = -0.11, 95% CI:-0.25 to 0.02, five RCTs, 720 participants) between CBT and control groups, while there was an improvement in insomnia severity (SMD = -0.65, 95% CI: -1.06 to -0.24, four RCTs, 639 participants, medium treatment effect) and sleep efficiency (SMD = 0.32, 95% CI: 0.04 to 0.59, three RCTs, 352 patients, small treatment effect). During follow-up, CBT improved pain severity (SMD = -0.52, 95% CI: -1.03 to -0.01, eight studies, 1447 participants, medium treatment effect), insomnia (SMD = -0.43, 95% CI: -0.85 to -0.01, three RCTs, 571 participants, small treatment effect), and depression (SMD = -0.39, 95% CI: -0.59 to -0.18, four RCTs, 791 participants, small treatment effect). Nevertheless, sleep efficiency, fatigue, and physical function were not improved in the follow-up period.Our results may suggest the durability of CBT-associated treatment benefits, supporting its role as a potential promising alternative or complementary intervention for patients with knee/hip osteoarthritis, especially against pain and insomnia. Future large-scale investigations are warranted to verify our findings.[https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/], identifier [CRD42022331165].","['cognitive behavior therapy', 'insomnia', 'metaanalysis', 'osteoarthritis', 'pain']"
Maternal Emotional States in Relation to Offspring Weight and Health-Related Quality of Life: Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study.,"Maternal characteristics have been known to be associated with parenting practices, which could eventually influence their child's weight and health-related quality of life (HRQoL).This study aimed to assess the direct and indirect associations of maternal emotional states (depression, anxiety, and stress) with body mass index (BMI) and HRQoL in their children.This study was conducted within the framework of the Tehran lipid and glucose study (TLGS). Participants were the children (n = 231) enrolled in TLGS during 2014 - 2016, who had complete data on maternal emotional states. The body weight and height of children were measured using the standard protocol, and BMI Z-score was determined using Anthroplus. Also, HRQoL in children and emotional states in mothers were assessed using the Iranian version of the pediatric quality of life inventory (PedsQLTM4.0) and the depression, anxiety, and stress scale (DASS-21), respectively. Structural equations modeling (SEM) was used to assess the direct and indirect relations of maternal emotional states with children's BMI Z-score and HRQoL.Mean age, BMI Z-score, and HRQoL total score in children were 13.8 ± 3.1 years, 0.74 ± 1.5, and 84.7 ± 11.3, respectively. In the mothers, median DASS-21 scores (interquartile ranges) in the three scales of depression, anxiety, and stress were 4 (0 - 10), 6 (2 - 12), and 14 (8 - 20), respectively. Maternal level of education was significantly associated with the DASS-21 score (β = -0.23, 95% CI: -0.37,-0.07). Maternal DASS-21 score was significantly associated with BMI Z-score only in girls (β = 0.25, 95% CI: 0.06, 0.53). Significant determinants of HRQoL in boys were the child's age (β = -0.21, 95% CI: -0.40, -0.01) and maternal education (β = -0.24, 95%CI: -0.44, -0.02) and emotional state (β = -0.24, 95% CI: -0.44, -0.03). The child's age (β = -0.33, 95% CI: -0.53, -0.10) and maternal emotional state (β = -0.31, 95% CI: -0.54, -0.08) were significantly associated with HRQoL in girls.The maternal emotional state is an important determinant of HRQoL in children, regardless of their weight status. Further research is recommended to examine the current hypothesized model in rural and suburban populations, taking into consideration more influential factors.","['Children', 'Maternal Mental Health', 'Quality of Life', 'Weight']"
The Impact of Neoadjuvant Hormone Therapy on Surgical and Oncological Outcomes for Patients With Prostate Cancer Before Radical Prostatectomy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"This systematic study aimed to assess and compare the comprehensive evidence regarding the impact of neoadjuvant hormone therapy (NHT) on surgical and oncological outcomes of patients with prostate cancer (PCa) before radical prostatectomy (RP).Literature searches were performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Using PubMed, Web of Science, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang databases, we identified relevant studies published before July 2020. The pooled effect sizes were calculated in terms of the odds ratios (ORs)/standard mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using the fixed or random-effects model.We identified 22 clinical trials (6 randomized and 16 cohort) including 20,199 patients with PCa. Our meta-analysis showed no significant differences in body mass index (SMD = 0.10, 95% CI: -0.08-0.29, p = 0.274) and biopsy Gleason score (GS) (OR = 1.33, 95% CI: 0.76-2.35 p = 0.321) between the two groups. However, the NHT group had a higher mean age (SMD = 0.19, 95% CI: 0.07-0.31, p = 0.001), preoperative prostate-specific antigen (OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.19-0.75, p = 0.001), and clinic tumor stage (OR = 2.24, 95% CI: 1.53-3.29, p < 0.001). Compared to the RP group, the NHT group had lower positive surgical margins (PSMs) rate (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.29-0.67, p < 0.001) and biochemical recurrence (BCR) rate (OR = 0.47, 95% CI: 0.26-0.83, p = 0.009). Between both groups, there were no significant differences in estimated blood loss (SMD = -0.06, 95% CI: -0.24-0.13, p = 0.556), operation time (SMD = 0.20, 95% CI: -0.12-0.51, p = 0.219), pathological tumor stage (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.54-1.06, p = 0.104), specimen GS (OR = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.49-1.68, p = 0.756), and lymph node involvement (OR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.40-1.45, p = 0.404).NHT prior to RP appeared to reduce the tumor stage, PSMs rate, and risk of BCR in patients with PCa. According to our data, NHT may be more suitable for older patients with higher tumor stage. Besides, NHT may not increase the surgical difficulty of RP.","['clinical research', 'metaanalysis', 'neoadjuvant hormone therapy', 'prostate cancer', 'radical prostatectomy']"
Pre-existing Liver Diseases and On-Admission Liver-Related Laboratory Tests in COVID-19: A Prognostic Accuracy Meta-Analysis With Systematic Review.,"<b>Background:</b> We aimed to perform a systematic search and meta-analysis to evaluate the prognostic value of on-admission liver function tests and pre-existing liver diseases on the clinical course of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). <b>Methods:</b> The study was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020182902). We searched five databases between 01/01/2020 and 04/23/2020. Studies that reported on liver-related comorbidities and/or laboratory parameters in patients with COVID-19 were included. The main outcomes were COVID-19 severity, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and in-hospital mortality. Analysis of predictive models hierarchical summary receiver-operating characteristic (HSROC) was conducted with a 95% confidence interval (CI). <b>Results:</b> Fifty studies were included in the meta-analysis. High specificity was reached by acute liver failure associated by COVID-19 (0.94, 95% CI: 0.71-0.99) and platelet count (0.94, 95% CI: 0.71-0.99) in the case of mortality; chronic liver disease (CLD) (0.98, 95% CI: 0.96-0.99) and platelet count (0.82, 95% CI: 0.72-0.89) in the case of ICU requirement; and CLD (0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.98), chronic hepatitis B infection (0.97, 95% CI: 0.95-0.98), platelet count (0.86, 95% CI: 0.77-0.91), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (0.80, 95% CI: 0.66-0.89) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (0.84, 95% CI: 0.77-0.88) activities considering severe COVID-19. High sensitivity was found in the case of C-reactive protein (CRP) for ICU requirement (0.92, 95% CI: 0.80-0.97) and severe COVID-19 (0.91, 95% CI: 0.82-0.96). <b>Conclusion:</b> On-admission platelet count, ALT and AST activities, CRP concentration, and the presence of acute and CLDs predicted the severe course of COVID-19. To highlight, pre-existing liver diseases or acute liver injury associated by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection plays an important role in the prediction of mortality.","['COVID19', 'SARS—CoV2', 'hepatology', 'pandemic COVID19', 'prognosis']"
Bilateral Carotid Artery Molecular Calcification Assessed by [<sup>18</sup>F] Fluoride PET/CT: Correlation with Cardiovascular and Thromboembolic Risk Factors.,"Atherosclerosis, a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, involves inflammatory processes that result in plaque formation and calcification. The early detection of the molecular changes underlying these processes is crucial for effective disease management. This study utilized positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) with [<sup>18</sup>F] sodium fluoride (NaF) as a tracer to visualize active calcification and inflammation at the molecular level. Our aim was to investigate the association between cardiovascular risk factors and [<sup>18</sup>F] NaF uptake in the left and right common carotid arteries (LCC and RCC). A cohort of 102 subjects, comprising both at-risk individuals and healthy controls, underwent [<sup>18</sup>F] NaF PET/CT imaging. The results revealed significant correlations between [<sup>18</sup>F] NaF uptake and cardiovascular risk factors such as age (β = 0.005, 95% CI 0.003-0.008, <i>p</i> < 0.01 in LCC and β = 0.006, 95% CI 0.004-0.009, <i>p</i> < 0.01 in RCC), male gender (β = -0.08, 95% CI -0.173--0.002, <i>p</i> = 0.04 in LCC and β = -0.13, 95% CI -0.21--0.06, <i>p</i> < 0.01 in RCC), BMI (β = 0.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.03, <i>p</i> < 0.01 in LCC and β = 0.02, 95% CI 0.01-0.03, <i>p</i> < 0.01 in RCC), fibrinogen (β = 0.006, 95% CI 0.0009-0.01, <i>p</i> = 0.02 in LCC and β = 0.005, 95% CI 0.001-0.01, <i>p</i> = 0.01), HDL cholesterol (β = 0.13, 95% CI 0.04-0.21, <i>p</i> < 0.01 in RCC only), and CRP (β = -0.01, 95% CI -0.02-0.001, <i>p</i> = 0.03 in RCC only). Subjects at risk showed a higher [<sup>18</sup>F] NaF uptake compared to healthy controls (one-way ANOVA; <i>p</i> = 0.02 in LCC and <i>p</i> = 0.04 in RCC), and uptake increased with estimated cardiovascular risk (one-way ANOVA, <i>p</i> < 0.01 in LCC only). These findings underscore the potential of [<sup>18</sup>F] NaF PET/CT as a sensitive tool for the early detection of atherosclerotic plaque, assessment of cardiovascular risk, and monitoring of disease progression.

Comparison of VTE risk scores in guidelines for VTE diagnosis in nonsurgical hospitalized patients with suspected VTE.,"The assessment of VTE likelihood with VTE risk scores is essential prior to imaging examinations during VTE diagnostic procedure. Little is known with respect to the disparity of predictive power for VTE diagnosis among VTE risk scores in guidelines for nonsurgical hospitalized patients with clinically suspected VTE.A retrospective study was performed to compare the predictive power for VTE diagnosis among the Wells, Geneva, YEARS, PERC, Padua, and IMPROVE scores in the leading authoritative guidelines in nonsurgical hospitalized patients with suspected VTE.Among 3168 nonsurgical hospitalized patients with suspected VTE, VTE was finally excluded in 2733(86.3%) ones, whereas confirmed in 435(13.7%) ones. The sensitivity and specificity resulted from the Wells, Geneva, YEARS, PERC, Padua, and IMPROVE scores were (90.3%, 49.8%), (88.7%, 53.6%), (73.8%, 50.2%), (97.7%,16.9%), (80.9%, 44.0%), and (78.2%, 47.0%), respectively. The YI were 0.401, 0.423, 0.240, 0.146, 0.249, and 0.252 for the Wells, Geneva, YEARS, PERC, Padua, and IMPROVE scores, respectively. The C-index were 0.694(0.626-0.762), 0.697(0.623-0.772), 0.602(0.535-0.669), 0.569(0.486-0.652), 0.607(0.533-0.681), and 0.609(0.538-0.680) for the Wells, Geneva, YEARS, PERC, Padua, and IMPROVE scores, respectively. Consistency was significant in the pairwise comparison of Wells vs Geneva(Kappa 0.753, P = 0.565), YEARS vs Padua(Kappa 0.816, P = 0.565), YEARS vs IMPROVE(Kappa 0.771, P = 0.645), and Padua vs IMPROVE(Kappa 0.789, P = 0.812), whereas it did not present in the other pairs. The YI was improved to 0.304, 0.272, and 0.264 for the PERC(AUC 0.631[0.547-0.714], P = 0.006), Padua(AUC 0.613[0.527-0.700], P = 0.017), and IMPROVE(AUC 0.614[0.530-0.698], P = 0.016), with a revised cutoff of 5 or less, 6 or more, and 4 or more denoting the VTE-likely, respectively.For nonsurgical hospitalized patients with suspected VTE, the Geneva and Wells scores perform best, the PERC scores performs worst despite its significantly high sensitivity, whereas the others perform intermediately, albeit the absolute predictive power of all isolated scores are mediocre. The predictive power of the PERC, Padua, and IMPROVE scores are improved with revised cutoffs.","['Diagnosis', 'Guidelines', 'Nonsurgical hospitalized patients', 'Predictive power', 'Risk score', 'Venous thromboembolism']"
Diagnostic value of symptoms of oesophagogastric cancers in primary care: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Selection of primary care patients for investigation of potential oesophagogastric cancer is difficult, as the symptoms may represent benign conditions, which are also more common.To review systematically the presenting features of oesophagogastric cancers in primary care, including open-access endoscopy clinics.Systematic review and meta-analysis.MEDLINE®, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and CINAHL were searched for studies of adults who were symptomatic and presented in primary care or open-access endoscopy clinics. Exclusions were being asymptomatic, screening, or recurrent cancers. Data were extracted to estimate the diagnostic performance of features of oesophagogastric cancers and summarised in a meta-analysis.Fourteen studies were identified. The strongest summary sensitivity and specificity estimates were for: dyspepsia 0.42 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.29 to 0.56) and 0.48 (95% CI = 0.31 to 0.65); pain 0.41 (95% CI = 0.24 to 0.62) and 0.75 (95% CI = 0.51 to 0.89); and dysphagia 0.32 (95% CI = 0.17 to 0.52) and 0.92 (95% CI = 0.81 to 0.97). Summary positive likelihood ratios (LR+) and diagnostic odds ratios were: dyspepsia 0.79 (95% CI = 0.55 to 1.15) and 0.65 (95% CI = 0.32 to 1.33); pain 1.64 (95% CI = 1.20 to 2.24) and 2.09 (95% CI = 1.57 to 2.77); and dysphagia 4.32 (95% CI = 2.46 to 7.58) and 5.91 (95% CI = 3.56 to 9.82). Sensitivity was lower for: anaemia 0.12 [95% Cl = 0.08 to 0.19] with specificity 0.97 [95% Cl = 0.94 to 0.99]; nausea/vomiting/bloating 0.17 [95% Cl = 0.05 to 0.46] and 0.84 [95% Cl = 0.60 to 0.94] respectively; reflux 0.23 [95% Cl = 0.10 to 0.46] and 0.70 [95% Cl = 0.59 to 0.80]; weight loss 0.25 [95% Cl = 0.12 to 0.43] and 0.96 [95% Cl = 0.88 to 0.98]. [corrected]. Corresponding LR+ were: anaemia 4.32 (95% CI = 2.64 to 7.08); nausea/vomiting/bloating 1.07 (95% CI = 0.52 to 2.19); reflux 0.78 (95% CI = 0.47 to 1.78) and; weight loss 5.46 (95% CI = 3.47 to 8.60).Dysphagia, weight loss, and anaemia show the strongest association but with relatively low sensitivity and high specificity. The findings support the value of investigation of these symptoms, but also suggest that, in a population of patients who are low risk but not no-risk, investigation is not currently recommended.","['diagnosis', 'oesophageal neoplasms', 'primary health care', 'stomach neoplasms', 'symptom', 'systematic review']"
"Discrimination, Mental Health, and Readiness to Quit Smoking.","We conducted a cross-sectional study, examining the mediation effects of depression and anxiety on the association between discrimination and readiness to quit cigarette smoking among African American adult cigarette smokers experiencing homelessness. Using a convenience sample, participants were recruited from a homeless shelter in Southern California. Scores of discrimination, depressive, and anxiety symptoms, and readiness to quit smoking were analyzed using linear regression modeling. We enrolled 100 participants; 58 participants were male. In the final model, discrimination had no association with readiness to quit (<i>b</i> = 0.02; 95% CI [-0.04, 0.08]; <i>p</i> = 0.47).

Relationship between anthropometric characteristics and aerobic fitness among Malaysian men and women.,"This cross-sectional study evaluated the relationships between anthropometric and aerobic fitness (rate of perceived exertion [RPE] and predicted maximal oxygen uptake [VO<sub>2max</sub>]) among 228 participants (age: 23.78±4.42 years). RPE and predicted VO<sub>2max</sub> were determined during the cycle ergometer exercise test. Data were also obtained for height, weight, body mass index (BMI), hip and waist (WC) circumferences. Data analysis revealed VO<sub>2max</sub> is correlated with WC (<i>r</i>=-0.571), weight (<i>r</i>=-0.521), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) (<i>r</i>=-0.516), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) (<i>r</i>=-0.487), and BMI (<i>r</i>=-0.47) in men, while, in women with WC (<i>r</i>=-0.581), weight (<i>r</i>=-0.571), WHtR (<i>r</i>=-0.545), BMI (<i>r</i>=-0.545), WHR (<i>r</i>=-0.473), and height (<i>r</i>=-0.287) (all <i>P</i><0.05). Regression analysis showed WC was a significant predictor for VO<sub>2max</sub> in men and women (<i>r</i> <sub>2</sub>=32.6% vs. 33.7%). The receiver operating characteristic curve of WC showed 0.786 and 0.831 for men and women, respectively. WC or abdominal obesity is the strongest predictor for VO<sub>2max</sub>, which is an indicator of aerobic fitness in Malaysian adults.","['Aerobic fitness', 'Anthropometry', 'Malaysia', 'Submaximal cycle test', 'Waist circumference']"

Genetic analysis of semen characteristic traits in Norwegian Red bulls at the artificial insemination center.,"Compared with cow fertility, genetic analyses of bull fertility are limited and based on relatively few animals. The aim of the present study was to estimate genetic parameters for semen characteristics of Norwegian Red bulls at the artificial insemination (AI) center (Geno AI station, Stange, Norway) and to estimate genetic correlations between some of these traits and andrology traits measured at the performance test station. The data from the AI center consisted of records from 137,919 semen collections from 3,145 bulls with information on semen weight, sperm concentration, motility before and after cryopreservation, motility change during cryopreservation, and number of accepted straws made. Data from the performance test station included 12,522 observations from 3,219 bulls on semen volume, concentration, and motility (%) when fresh and after storing for 24 and 48 h. Genetic parameters were estimated using linear animal repeatability models that included fixed effects of year-month of observation, age of bull, interaction between semen collection number, and interval between collections for all traits and type of diluter for postcryopreservation traits. The random effects included test-day, permanent environmental, and additive genetic effects of the bull. Based on records from the AI center, we found that semen weight, sperm concentration, and number of straws were moderately heritable (0.18-0.20), whereas motility had a lower heritability (0.02-0.08). Heritability of motility (%) was higher after cryopreservation than before. Genetic correlations among the semen characteristics ranged from unfavorable (-0.35) to favorable (0.93), with standard errors ranging from 0.02 to 0.22. Among the most precise genetic correlation estimates, number of straws made from a batch correlated favorably with semen weight (0.62 ± 0.06) and sperm concentration (0.44 ± 0.08), whereas sperm concentration was negatively correlated with weight (-0.33 ± 0.09). The genetic correlation between motility (%) before and after cryopreservation was 0.64 ± 0.14, and motility change during cryopreservation had a strong favorable genetic correlation with motility after cryopreservation (-0.93 ± 0.02). The estimated genetic correlation (standard error) between the traits volume, concentration, and motility when fresh measured at the performance test station and their respective corresponding traits at the AI center were 0.83 (0.05), 0.78 (0.09), and 0.49 (0.31). The final product at the AI center (number of accepted straws) correlated genetically favorably with all semen characteristic traits recorded at the performance test station (ranging from 0.51 to 0.67). Our results show that the andrology testing done at the performance test station is a resource to identify the genetically best bulls for AI production.","['andrology', 'bull fertility', 'genetic parameter']"
Good adherence to mediterranean diet can prevent gastrointestinal symptoms: A survey from Southern Italy.,"To evaluate how different levels of adherence to a mediterranean diet (MD) correlate with the onset of functional gastrointestinal disorders.As many as 1134 subjects (598 M and 536 F; age range 17-83 years) were prospectively investigated in relation to their dietary habits and the presence of functional gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients with relevant chronic organic disease were excluded from the study. The Mediterranean Diet Quality index for children and adolescents (KIDMED) and the Short Mediterranean Diet Questionnaire were administered. All subjects were grouped into five categories according to their ages: 17-24 years; 25-34; 35-49; 50-64; above 64.On the basis of the Rome III criteria, our population consisted of 719 (63.4%) individuals who did not meet the criteria for any functional disorder and were classified as controls (CNT), 172 (13.3%) patients meeting criteria for prevalent irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and 243 (23.3%) meeting criteria for prevalent functional dyspepsia (FD). A significantly lower adherence score in IBS (0.57 ± 0.23, <i>P</i> < 0.001) and FD (0.56 ± 0.24, <i>P</i> < 0.05) was found compared to CNT (0.62 ± 0.21). Females with FD and IBS exhibited significantly lower adherence scores (respectively 0.58 ± 0.24, <i>P</i> < 0.05 and 0.56 ± 0.22, <i>P</i> < 0.05) whereas males were significantly lower only for FD (0.53 ± 0.25, <i>P</i> < 0.05). Age cluster analyses showed a significantly lower score in the 17-24 years and 25-34 year categories for FD (17-24 years: 0.44 ± 0.21, <i>P</i> < 0.001; 25-34 years: 0.48 ± 0.22, <i>P</i> < 0.05) and IBS (17-24 years: 0.45 ± 0.20, <i>P</i> < 0.05; 24-34 years: 0.44 ± 0.21, <i>P</i> < 0.001) compared to CNT (17-24 years: 0.56 ± 0.21; 25-34 years: 0.69 ± 0.20).Low adherence to MD may trigger functional gastrointestinal symptoms, mainly in younger subjects. Moreover, with increasing age, patients tend to adopt dietary regimens closer to MD.","['Dietary regimen', 'Functional dyspepsia', 'Functional gastrointestinal disorders', 'Irritable bowel syndrome', 'Mediterranean diet']"
Longitudinal analysis of residual feed intake and BW in mink using random regression with heterogeneous residual variance.,"The aim of this study was to determine the genetic background of longitudinal residual feed intake (RFI) and BW gain in farmed mink using random regression methods considering heterogeneous residual variances. The individual BW was measured every 3 weeks from 63 to 210 days of age for 2139 male+female pairs of juvenile mink during the growing-furring period. Cumulative feed intake was calculated six times with 3-week intervals based on daily feed consumption between weighing's from 105 to 210 days of age. Genetic parameters for RFI and BW gain in males and females were obtained using univariate random regression with Legendre polynomials containing an animal genetic effect and permanent environmental effect of litter along with heterogeneous residual variances. Heritability estimates for RFI increased with age from 0.18 (0.03, posterior standard deviation (PSD)) at 105 days of age to 0.49 (0.03, PSD) and 0.46 (0.03, PSD) at 210 days of age in male and female mink, respectively. The heritability estimates for BW gain increased with age and had moderate to high range for males (0.33 (0.02, PSD) to 0.84 (0.02, PSD)) and females (0.35 (0.03, PSD) to 0.85 (0.02, PSD)). RFI estimates during the growing period (105 to 126 days of age) showed high positive genetic correlations with the pelting RFI (210 days of age) in male (0.86 to 0.97) and female (0.92 to 0.98). However, phenotypic correlations were lower from 0.47 to 0.76 in males and 0.61 to 0.75 in females. Furthermore, BW records in the growing period (63 to 126 days of age) had moderate (male: 0.39, female: 0.53) to high (male: 0.87, female: 0.94) genetic correlations with pelting BW (210 days of age). The result of current study showed that RFI and BW in mink are highly heritable, especially at the late furring period, suggesting potential for large genetic gains for these traits. The genetic correlations suggested that substantial genetic gain can be obtained by only considering the RFI estimate and BW at pelting, however, lower genetic correlations than unity indicate that extra genetic gain can be obtained by including estimates of these traits during the growing period. This study suggests random regression methods are suitable for analysing feed efficiency and BW gain; and genetic selection for RFI in mink is promising.","['BW gain', 'feed efficiency', 'genetic parameters', 'longitudinal analysis', 'mink']"
Genetic parameters for novel mastitis traits defined by combining test-day somatic cell score and differential somatic cell count in the first lactation of Japanese Holsteins.,"In this study, we aimed to improve current udder health genetic evaluations by addressing the limitations of monthly sampled somatic cell score (SCS) for distinguishing cows with robust innate immunity from those susceptible to chronic infections. The objectives were to (1) establish novel somatic cell traits by integrating SCS and the differential somatic cell count (DSCC), which represents the combined proportion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and lymphocytes in somatic cells and (2) estimate genetic parameters for the new traits, including their daily heritability and genetic correlations with milk production traits and SCS, using a random regression test-day model (RRTDM). We derived 3 traits, namely ML_SCS_DSCC, SCS_4_DSCC_65_binary, and ML_SCS_DSCC_binary, by using milk loss estimates at corresponding SCS and DSCC levels, thresholds established in previous studies, and a threshold established from milk loss estimates, respectively. Data consisted of test-day records collected during January 2021 through March 2022 from 265 herds in Hokkaido, Japan. From these records, we extracted records between 7 to 305 d in milk (DIM) in the first lactation to fit the RRTDM. The model included the random effect of herd-test-day, the fixed effect of year-month, fixed lactation curves nested with calving age groups, and random regressions with Legendre polynomials of order 3 for additive genetic and permanent environmental effects. The analysis was performed using Gibbs sampling with Gibbsf90+ software. The averages (ranges) of daily heritability estimates over lactation were 0.086 (0.075 to 0.095) for SCS, 0.104 (0.073 to 0.127) for ML_SCS_DSCC, 0.137 (0.014 to 0.297) for SCS_4_DSCC_65_binary, and 0.138 (0.115 to 0.185) for ML_SCS_DSCC_binary; the heritability curve for SCS_4_DSCC_65_binary was erratic. Genetic correlations within the trait decreased as the DIM interval widened, especially for those integrating DSCC, indicating that these traits should be analyzed using RRTDM rather than repeatability models. The averages (ranges) of genetic correlations with milk yield over lactation were 0.01 (-0.22 to 0.28) for SCS, -0.05 (-0.40 to 0.13) for ML_SCS_DSCC, -0.08 (-0.17 to 0.09) for SCS_4_DSCC_65_binary, and -0.08 (-0.22 to 0.27) for ML_SCS_DSCC_binary. Compared with SCS, the newly defined traits exhibited slightly stronger negative genetic correlations with milk yield. Especially in late lactation stages, the genetic correlation between ML_SCS_DSCC and milk yield was significantly below zero, with a posterior median of -0.40. Furthermore, the new traits showed positive correlations with SCS, having estimates varying from 0.68 to 0.85 for ML_SCS_DSCC, 0.14 to 0.47 for SCS_4_DSCC_65_binary, and 0.61 to 0.66 for ML_SCS_DSCC_binary, depending on DIM. Considering that ML_SCS_DSCC and ML_SCS_DSCC_binary have relatively high heritability (compared with SCS) and favorable genetic correlations with milk production traits and SCS, their incorporation into breeding programs appears promising. Nevertheless, their genetic relationships with (sub)clinical mastitis require further investigation.","['differential somatic cell count', 'immuneassociated trait', 'mastitis', 'somatic cell score']"

Clinical Indicators for Asthma-COPD Overlap: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Some clinical indicators have been reported to be useful in differentiating asthma-chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) overlap (ACO) from pure asthma/COPD, but the results were inconsistent. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic value of these indicators for ACO.Databases of PubMed, EMBASE, Ovid and Web of Science were retrieved. Pooled standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated in random-effects models.48 eligible studies were included. The pooled results indicated, compared with pure asthma, ACO patients had lower levels of forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV<sub>1</sub>)% predicted (pred) (SMD=-1.09, 95% CI -1.3 to -0.87), diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO)% pred (SMD=-0.83, 95% CI -1.24 to -0.42), fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) (SMD=-0.23, 95% CI -0.36 to -0.11), and higher levels of induced sputum neutrophil (SMD = 0.51, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.81), circulating YKL-40 (SMD = 0.96, 95% CI 0.27 to 1.64). However, relative to COPD alone, ACO patients had higher levels of FEV<sub>1</sub>% pred (SMD = 0.15, 95% CI 0.05 to 0.26), DLCO% pred (SMD = 0.38, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.6), FeNO (SMD = 0.59, 95% CI 0.40 to 0.78), serum total immunoglobulin (Ig)E (SMD = 0.42, 95% CI 0.1 to 0.75), blood eosinophil (SMD = 0.44, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.59), induced sputum eosinophil (SMD = 0.62, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.83), and lower levels of induced sputum neutrophil (SMD=-0.48, 95% CI -0.7 to -0.27), circulating YKL-40 (SMD=-1.09, 95% CI -1.92 to -0.26).Compared with pure asthma/COPD, ACO patients have different levels of FEV<sub>1</sub>% pred, DLCO% pred, FeNO, serum total IgE, blood eosinophil, induced sputum eosinophil/neutrophil, and circulating YKL-40, which could be helpful to establish a clinical diagnosis of ACO.","['COPD', 'asthma', 'asthmaCOPD overlap', 'indicators', 'metaanalysis']"

This study aims to estimate the efficacy of mindfulness meditation in the treatment of military-related PTSD, by synthesizing evidences from randomized controlled trials.Five electronic databases (Pubmed, EBSCO Medline, Embase, PsychINFO and Cochrane Library) were searched for randomized controlled trials focusing on the treatment effect of mindfulness meditation on military-related PTSD. The selection of eligible studies was based on identical inclusion and exclusion criteria. Information about study characteristics, participant characteristics, intervention details, PTSD outcomes, as well as potential adverse effects was extracted from the included studies. Risk of bias of all the included studies was critically assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's tool. R Statistical software was performed for data analysis.A total of 1902 records were initially identified and screened. After duplicates removal and title & abstract review, finally, 19 articles in English language with 1326 participants were included through strict inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results revealed that mindfulness meditation had a significantly larger effect on alleviating military-related PTSD symptoms compared with control conditions, such as treatment as usual, present-centered group therapy and PTSD health education (standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.33; 95% CI [-0.45, -0.21]; p < 0.0001). Mindfulness interventions with different control conditions (active or non-active control, SMD = -0.33, 95% CI [-0.46, -0.19]; SMD = -0.49, 95% CI [-0.88, -0.10], respectively), formats of delivery (group-based or individual-based, SMD = -0.30, 95% CI [-0.42, -0.17], SMD = -0.49, 95% CI [-0.90, -0.08], respectively) and intervention durations (short-term or standard duration, SMD = -0.27, 95% CI [-0.46, -0.08], SMD = -0.40, 95% CI [-0.58, -0.21], respectively) were equally effective in improving military-related PTSD symptoms.Findings from this meta-analysis consolidate the efficacy and feasibility of mindfulness meditation in the treatment of military-related PTSD. Further evidence with higher quality and more rigorous design is needed in the future.","['Metaanalysis', 'Military personnel', 'Mindfulness meditation', 'Posttraumatic stress disorder']"
An MRI-defined measure of cerebral lesion severity to assess therapeutic effects in multiple sclerosis.,"Assess the sensitivity of the Magnetic Resonance Disease Severity Scale (MRDSS), based on cerebral lesions and atrophy, for treatment monitoring of glatiramer acetate (GA) in relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). This retrospective non-randomized pilot study included patients who started daily GA [n = 23, age (median, range) 41 (26.2, 53.1) years, Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score 1.0 (0, 3.5)], or received no disease-modifying therapy (noDMT) [n = 21, age 44.8 (28.2, 55.4), EDSS 0 (0, 2.5)] for 2 years. MRDSS was the sum of z-scores (normalized to a reference sample) of T2 hyperintense lesion volume (T2LV), the ratio of T1 hypointense LV to T2LV (T1/T2), and brain parenchymal fraction (BPF) multiplied by negative 1. The two groups were compared by Wilcoxon rank sum tests; within group change was assessed by Wilcoxon signed rank tests. Glatiramer acetate subjects had less progression than noDMT on T1/T2 [(median z-score change (range), 0 (-1.07, 1.20) vs. 0.41 (-0.30, 2.51), p = 0.003)] and MRDSS [0.01 (-1.33, 1.28) vs. 0.46 (-1.57, 2.46), p = 0.01]; however, not on BPF [0.12 (-0.18, 0.58) vs. 0.10 (-1.47,0.50), p = 0.59] and T2LV [-0.03 (-0.90, 0.57) vs. 0.01 (-1.69, 0.34), p = 0.40]. While GA subjects worsened only on BPF [0.12 (-0.18, 0.58), p = 0.001], noDMT worsened on BPF [0.10 (-1.47, 0.50), p = 0.002], T1/T2 [0.41 (-0.30, 2.51), p = 0.0002], and MRDSS [0.46 (-1.57, 2.46), p = 0.0006]. These preliminary findings show the potential of two new cerebral MRI metrics to track MS therapeutic response. The T1/T2, an index of the destructive potential of lesions, may provide particular sensitivity to treatment effects.","['Brain atrophy', 'Composite scale', 'Glatiramer acetate', 'MRI', 'Multiple sclerosis']"
Gut microbiota and sepsis and sepsis-related death: a Mendelian randomization investigation.,"It is unclear what the causal relationship is between the gut microbiota and sepsis. Therefore, we employed Mendelian randomization (MR) to determine whether a causal link exists between the two.This study used publicly available genome-wide association studies (GWAS) summary data of gut microbiota, sepsis, sepsis (critical care), and sepsis (28-day death in critical care) to perform a two-sample MR analysis. To ensure the robustness of the results, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis.For sepsis susceptibility, inverse variance weighted (IVW) estimates revealed that <i>Victivallales</i> (OR = 0.86, 95% CI, 0.78-0.94, <i>p</i> = 0.0017) was protective against sepsis, while <i>Lentisphaerae</i> (OR = 0.89, 95% CI, 0.80-0.99), <i>Gammaproteobacteria</i> (OR = 1.37, 95% CI, 1.08-1.73), <i>Clostridiaceae1</i> (OR = 1.21, 95% CI, 1.04-1.40), <i>RuminococcaceaeUCG011</i> (OR = 1.10, 95% CI, 1.01-1.20), <i>Dialister</i> (OR = 0.85, 95% CI, 0.74-0.97), and <i>Coprococcus2</i> (OR = 0.81, 95% CI, 0.69-0.94) presented a suggestive association with the development of sepsis (all <i>p</i> < 0.05). For sepsis (critical care), IVW estimates indicated that <i>Lentisphaerae</i> (OR = 0.70, 95% CI, 0.53-0.93), <i>Victivallales</i> (OR = 0.67, 95% CI, 0.50-0.91), <i>Anaerostipes</i> (OR = 0.49, 95% CI, 0.31-0.76), <i>LachnospiraceaeUCG004</i> (OR = 0.51, 95% CI, 0.34-0.77), and <i>Coprococcus1</i> (OR = 0.66, 95% CI, 0.44-0.99) showed a suggestive negative correlation with sepsis (critical care) (all <i>p</i> < 0.05). For sepsis (28-day death in critical care), IVW estimates suggested that four bacterial taxa had a normally significant negative correlation with the risk of sepsis-related death, including <i>Victivallales</i> (OR = 0.54, 95% CI, 0.30-0.95), <i>Coprococcus2</i> (OR = 0.34, 95% CI, 0.14-0.83), <i>Ruminiclostridium6</i> (OR = 0.43, 95% CI, 0.22-0.83), and <i>Coprococcus1</i> (OR = 0.45, 95% CI, 0.21-0.97), while two bacterial taxa were normally significantly positively linked to the risk of sepsis-related death, namely, <i>Mollicutes</i> (OR = 2.03, 95% CI, 1.01-4.08) and <i>Bacteroidales</i> (OR = 2.65, 95% CI, 1.18-5.96) (all <i>p</i> < 0.05). The robustness of the above correlations was verified by additional sensitivity analyses.This MR research found that several gut microbiota taxa were causally linked to the risk of sepsis, sepsis in critical care, and sepsis-related 28-day mortality in critical care.","['Mendelian randomization', 'causality', 'gut microbiota', 'sepsis', 'sepsisrelated death']"
Orexin Receptor Antagonists as Adjunct Drugs for the Treatment of Depression: A Mini Meta-Analysis.,"There is growing interest in the efficacy of orexin receptor antagonists (ORA), one of the new psychopharmacological agents used in the treatment of insomnia, in other psychiatric disorders such as depression.This meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with PRISMA requirements. Literature searches were conducted using PubMed, Scopus and EBSCO (Medline) databases. Search words were (depression OR mood disorder OR affective disorder) AND (orexin OR orx OR hypocretin OR orx1 OR orx2 OR orexin receptor antagonist OR almorexant OR suvorexant OR lemborexant OR daridorexant OR seltorexant OR vornorexant OR filorexant). No date restrictions were used. The random effects model was used for analyses with I<sup>2</sup> values above 50% and fixed effects model was used for analyses with I<sup>2</sup> values below 50%.In the acute phase, ORAs had no significant effect on core, sleep-adjusted and total symptoms of depression respectively; Standardized Mean Difference (SMD) for random effect -0.422, 95% CI [-0.90; 0.06], p=0.089, I<sup>2</sup>=62.4%; SMD for random effect -0.375, 95% CI [-1.24; 0.49], p=0.400; I<sup>2</sup>=66.6% and SMD for random effect -0.477, 95% CI [-0.97; 0.01], p=0.059; I<sup>2</sup>=83.1%). However, they had a significant effect on core and total symptoms of depression in the early period respectively; SMD for fixed effect=-0.228, 95% CI [-0.44; -0.01], p=0.036, I<sup>2</sup>=9.1%; and SMD for fixed effect=-0.186, 95% CI [-0.37; -0.001], p=0.048, I<sup>2</sup>=0.0%, respectively).The results of this meta-analysis suggest that ORAs may provide direct antidepressant efficacy when added to existing antidepressant treatment and may also have indirect antidepressant effects through improvement in sleep symptoms. Considering the physiological effects of orexin on behaviors, ORAs may be promising new treatment modalities in the treatment of many psychiatric disorders other than insomnia. However, these results are preliminary and further studies with different ORAs at different doses and with different samples are needed.","['Depression', 'filorexant', 'orexin receptor antagonist', 'seltorexant', 'suvorexant']"
"Effects of Testosterone on Serum Concentrations, Fat-free Mass, and Physical Performance by Population: A Meta-analysis.","Testosterone (T) administration (TA) increases serum T and fat-free mass (FFM). Although TA-mediated increases in FFM may enhance physical performance, the data are largely equivocal, which may be due to differences in study populations, the magnitude of change in serum T and FFM, or the performance metrics. This meta-analysis explored effects of TA on serum T, FFM, and performance. Associations between increases in serum T and FFM were assessed, and whether changes in serum T or FFM, study population, or the performance metrics affected performance was determined. A systematic review of double-blind randomized trials comparing TA versus placebo on serum T, FFM, and performance was performed. Data were extracted from 20 manuscripts. Effect sizes (ESs) were assessed using Hedge's g and a random effects model. Data are presented as ES (95% confidence interval). No significant correlation between changes in serum T and FFM was observed (<i>P</i> = .167). Greater increases in serum T, but not FFM, resulted in larger effects on performance. Larger increases in testosterone (7.26 [0.76-13.75]) and FFM (0.80 [0.20-1.41]) were observed in young males, but performance only improved in diseased (0.16 [0.05-0.28]) and older males (0.19 [0.10-0.29]). TA increased lower body (0.12 [0.07-0.18]), upper body (0.26 [0.11-0.40]), and handgrip (0.13 [0.04-0.22]) strength, lower body muscular endurance (0.38 [0.09-0.68]), and functional performance (0.20 [0.00-0.41]), but not lower body power or aerobic endurance. TA elicits increases in serum T and FFM in younger, older, and diseased males; however, the performance-enhancing effects of TA across studies were small, observed mostly in muscular strength and endurance, and only in older and diseased males.","['age', 'body composition', 'disease', 'muscle mass', 'power', 'strength']"
Noninvasive biomarkers FibroTest and ActiTest versus liver biopsy in chronic hepatitis C patients: the Middle East experience.,"The aim of this study was to compare noninvasive biomarkers, FibroTest and ActiTest in predicting fibrosis stage and inflammation grade in chronic hepatitis C (CHC) patients with liver biopsy (LB).In 107 patients with CHC, levels of six serum biomarkers (alanine aminotransferase, γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, total bilirubin, haptoglobin, apolipoprotein, α-2 macroglobulin) were determined at the time of LB. LB was evaluated by Metavir score for fibrosis and inflammation. Voluntary blood donors (n=106) were taken as controls for the study.Fibrosis estimated by Fibrotest was significantly higher in patients compared to control group. The observed area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for advanced fibrosis (F3, F4) adjusted according to the observed difference between advanced and non-advanced fibrosis prevalence (DANA) was 0.80 (0.69-0.88) and the AUROC for cirrhosis (F4) was 0.94 (0.86-0.98). ActiTest AUROC for moderate to severe activity (A2A3) was 0.72 (0.61-0.81), and for severe activity (A3) was 0.88 (0.78-0.93). The diagnostic values in the group of good quality biopsy (n=41) showed Fibrotest AUROC (DANA-adjusted): for advanced fibrosis 0.90 (0.72-0.99); for cirrhosis 0.93 (0.76-0.98); and ctiTest AUROC: for moderate/severe activity 0.86 (0.67-0.94); and for severe activity 0.90 (0.76-0.93). There was good concordance between FibroTest and LB (with discordance for two or more stages in <20% for advanced fibrosis and <10% for cirrhosis) and between ActiTest and LB. Specificity for FibroTest and ActiTest in the control population were 95% and 100% respectively.Fibrotest and ActiTest had high observed and standardized diagnostic values for predicting fibrosis and activity respectively.","['ActiTest', 'Fibrotest', 'Liver biopsy', 'hepatitis C virus']"
The impact of feeding diets of high or low energy concentration on carcass measurements and the weight of primal and subprimal lean cuts.,"Pigs from four sire lines were allocated to a series of low energy (LE, 3.15 to 3.21 Mcal ME/kg) corn-soybean meal-based diets with 16% wheat midds or high energy diets (HE, 3.41 to 3.45 Mcal ME/kg) with 4.5 to 4.95% choice white grease. All diets contained 6% DDGS. The HE and LE diets of each of the four phases were formulated to have equal lysine:Mcal ME ratios. Barrows (N = 2,178) and gilts (N = 2,274) were fed either high energy (HE) or low energy (LE) diets from 27 kg BW to target BWs of 118, 127, 131.5 and 140.6 kg. Carcass primal and subprimal cut weights were collected. The cut weights and carcass measurements were fitted to allometric functions (Y = A CW(B)) of carcass weight. The significance of diet, sex or sire line with A and B was evaluated by linearizing the equations by log to log transformation. The effect of diet on A and B did not interact with sex or sire line. Thus, the final model was (B)) where Diet = -0.5 for the LE and 0.5 for HE diets and A and B are sire line-sex specific parameters. cut weight = (1+bD(Diet)) A(CW Diet had no affect on loin, Boston butt, picnic, baby back rib, or sparerib weights (p>0.10, bD = -0.003, -0.0029, 0.0002, 0.0047, -0.0025, respectively). Diet affected ham weight (bD = -0.0046, p = 0.01), belly weight (bD = 0.0188, p = 0.001) three-muscle ham weight (bD = -0.014, p = 0.001), boneless loin weight (bD = -0.010, p = 0.001), tenderloin weight (bD = -0.023, p = 0.001), sirloin weight (bD = -0.009, p = 0.034), and fat-free lean mass (bD = -0.0145, p = 0.001). Overall, feeding the LE diets had little impact on primal cut weight except to decrease belly weight. Feeding LE diets increased the weight of lean trimmed cuts by 1 to 2 percent at the same carcass weight.","['Carcass', 'Dietary Energy Concentration', 'Pork', 'Primal Weight']"
Decay of Cryptosporidium parvfum DNA in cowpats in subtropical environments determined using qPCR.,"Cryptosporidium oocysts pose a significant threat to public health due to its ability to contaminate environmental waters, leading to outbreaks of waterborne diseases and emphasizing the crucial need for effective water treatment and monitoring systems. This study aimed to investigate the decay of Cryptosporidium oocyst DNA in cow fecal matter under different environmental conditions prevalent in sub-tropical Southeast Queensland (SEQ) during summer and winter seasons. The effects of ambient sunlight and shaded conditions on the decay rates of C. parvum DNA in cow fecal samples were evaluated. The results showed that measurable levels of C. parvum DNA were observed for up to 60 days during the summer experiments, with a slower decay rate on the surface (k = -0.029) and sub-surface (k = -0.043) of the cowpat under shaded conditions than those on the surface (k = -0.064) and sub-surface (k = -0.079) under sunlight conditions. The decay rates of C. parvum DNA on the surface and sub-surface of the cowpat under shaded conditions were significantly slower (p = 0.004; p = 0.004) than those on the surface and sub-surface under sunlight conditions during summer experiments. During the winter treatments, measurable levels of C. parvum DNA were observed for up to 90 days, and the decay rates were slower on the surface (k = -0.036) and sub-surface (k = -0.034) of the cowpat under shaded conditions than those under sunlight conditions (k = -0.067 for surface and k = -0.057 for sub-surface). The decay rates of C. parvum DNA on the surface and sub-surface of the cowpat under shaded conditions were significantly slower than those on the surface (p = 0.009) and sub-surface (p = 0.041) under sunlight conditions during winter experiments. Moreover, the decay rate in the summer sunlight surface treatment (k = -0.064) was significantly faster from those in the winter shaded surface (k = -0.036; p = 0.018) and sub-surface (k = -0.034; p = 0.011) treatments. Similar results were also observed for summer sunlight sub-surface (k = -0.079), which was significantly faster than winter shaded surface (k = -0.036; p = 0.0008) and sub-surface (k = -0.034; p = 0.0005) treatments. Overall, these findings are important to enhance our understanding on the degradation of C. parvum DNA in cow fecal matter in SEQ, particularly in relation to seasonal variations and environmental conditions.","['C parvum', 'Cowpat', 'Decay rates', 'Human health risks', 'Water quality']"
Evaluation of the Global Health Security Index as a predictor of COVID-19 excess mortality standardised for under-reporting and age structure.,"Previous studies have observed that countries with the strongest levels of pandemic preparedness capacities experience the greatest levels of COVID-19 burden. However, these analyses have been limited by cross-country differentials in surveillance system quality and demographics. Here, we address limitations of previous comparisons by exploring country-level relationships between pandemic preparedness measures and comparative mortality ratios (CMRs), a form of indirect age standardisation, of excess COVID-19 mortality.We indirectly age standardised excess COVID-19 mortality, from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation modelling database, by comparing observed total excess mortality to an expected age-specific COVID-19 mortality rate from a reference country to derive CMRs. We then linked CMRs with data on country-level measures of pandemic preparedness from the Global Health Security (GHS) Index. These data were used as input into multivariable linear regression analyses that included income as a covariate and adjusted for multiple comparisons. We conducted a sensitivity analysis using excess mortality estimates from WHO and The Economist.The GHS Index was negatively associated with excess COVID-19 CMRs (table 2; β= -0.21, 95% CI= -0.35 to -0.08). Greater capacities related to prevention (β= -0.11, 95% CI= -0.22 to -0.00), detection (β= -0.09, 95% CI= -0.19 to -0.00), response (β = -0.19, 95% CI= -0.36 to -0.01), international commitments (β= -0.17, 95% CI= -0.33 to -0.01) and risk environments (β= -0.30, 95% CI= -0.46 to -0.15) were each associated with lower CMRs. Results were not replicated using excess mortality models that rely more heavily on reported COVID-19 deaths (eg, WHO and The Economist).The first direct comparison of COVID-19 excess mortality rates across countries accounting for under-reporting and age structure confirms that greater levels of preparedness were associated with lower excess COVID-19 mortality. Additional research is needed to confirm these relationships as more robust national-level data on COVID-19 impact become available.","['COVID19', 'Health policy', 'Health systems']"
Detection of serum HE4 levels contributes to the diagnosis of lung cancer.,"Lung cancer (LC) is the most frequently diagnosed cancer and is the leading cause of cancer-associated death. Serum markers that exhibit high sensitivity and specificity for LC may assist in the diagnosis and prognosis of LC. The banked serum samples from 599 individuals, including 201 healthy controls, 124 patients with benign lung diseases, and 274 LC cases, were used. The serum concentrations of biomarkers were determined by electrochemiluminescence immunoassay and chemiluminescence immunoassay. The results showed that the serum human epididymis secretory protein 4 (HE4) levels in the LC group were significantly higher than in the healthy and benign lung disease groups. The serum levels of HE4, NSE, and CYFRA21-1 were significantly higher in patients with LC compared to those in the benign lung disease group. The area under the area under the curve (AUC) of HE4 for discriminating LC from healthy controls was 0.851 (95% CI, 0.818-0.884) and 0.739 (95% CI, 0.695-0.783), 0.747 (95% CI, 0.704-0.790), 0.626 (95% CI, 0.577-0.676), and 0.700 (95% CI, 0.653-0.747) for NSE, CYFRA21-1, SCC, and ProGRP, respectively. The AUC value of the combination of serum HE4 combined with NSE, CYFRA21-1, SCC, and proGRP for cancer diagnosis was 0.896 (95% CI, 0.868-0.923). In early LC, the AUC value of HE4 for discriminating early LC from healthy controls was 0.802 (95% CI, 0.758-0.845), 0.728 (95% CI, 0.679-0.778), 0.699 (95% CI, 0.646-0.752), 0.605 (95% CI, 0.548-0.662), and 0.685 (95% CI, 0.630-0.739) for NSE, CYFRA21-1, SCC, and ProGRP, respectively. The AUC value of the combination of serum HE4 with NSE, CYFRA21-1, SCC, and proGRP for early LC was 0.867 (95% CI, 0.831-0.903). Serum HE4 is a promising LC biomarker, particularly for early-stage LC. Measuring serum HE4 levels may improve the diagnostic efficiency of LC.","['biomarker', 'diagnosis', 'human epididymis secretory protein 4', 'lung cancer']"
"Self-Efficacy, Exercise Anticipation and Physical Activity in Elderly: Using Bayesian Networks to Elucidate Complex Relationships.","To explore the correlation of exercise anticipation, self-efficacy and lower limb function in the elderly, and identify active predictors of exercise. The time up and go (TUG) has been used to access basic mobility skills, as well as strength, balance and agility, which is used in a range of population.A cross-sectional survey approach was employed in this study, assessing the functional relationship of the level of exercise anticipation, modified gait efficacy scale (mGES), self-efficacy for exercise scale (SEE), perceived efficacy of patient-physician interactions (PEPPI-10), behavioral regulation in exercise questionnaire (BREQ), and the time up and go (TUG) and International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ). Consequently, we constructed the Bayesian network model utilizing Genie 2.3, in order to effectively determine clear negative and positive correlations.This investigation incorporated a total of 285 patients. The results of Spearman's correlation analysis indicated that the TUG effectively correlated with age (r = 0.158, P < 0.01), drinking (r=-0.362, P < 0.01), mGES (r=-0.254, P < 0.01), PEPPI (r=-0.329, P < 0.01), SEE (r =-0.408, P < 0.01), BREQ (r = 0.676, P < 0.01), EA (r =-0.688, P < 0.01) and IPAQ (r =-0.742, P < 0.01). TUG can be used as the direct influencing factor of IPA, and five nodes in the model can be considered the primary indirect influencing factors of TUG, such as drinking, EA, age, sex and mGES in Bayesian network. The sensitivity analysis of the model confirmed that TUG (0.059), drinking (0.087), EA (0.335), age (0.080), sex (0.164), mGES (0.028) and hypertension (0.030) can become the sensitivity evaluation indicators of IPAQ in the elderly community population, in which the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 59.6% (2207/3705), indicating a suitable prediction performance.Exercise anticipation and life behavior habit can effectively predict physical activity capability in the elderly. These findings can help clinicians establish effective intervention to improve the physical activity regularly of the elderly.","['elderly', 'exercise anticipation', 'physical activity', 'selfefficacy']"
Influence of exercise on the structure of the anterior chamber of the eye.,"To measure changes in anterior chamber structure before and after exercise in healthy individuals using anterior segment optical coherence tomography (ASOCT).Thirty-two healthy young individuals performed jogging for 20 min. Eye blinking rate was recorded during rest and exercise. The anterior chamber angle (ACA), angle opening distance at 500 μm from the scleral spur (AOD500), trabecular-iris space area at 500 μm from the scleral spur (TISA500), iris concavity (IC), iris concavity ratio (CR), iris thickness at 750 μm from the scleral spur (IT750), anterior chamber depth (ACD), anterior chamber width (ACW), pupil diameter (PD), intraocular pressure (IOP), blood pressure (BP) and heart rate (HR) were recorded before and after exercise. Anterior chamber angle (ACA), AOD500, TISA500, IC, IT750, ACD, ACW and PD were measured with ASOCT.Compared with rest, the blinking rate during exercise did not change significantly (13.04 ± 5.80 versus 13.52 ± 5.87 blinks/min, p = 0.645). The average IOP (15.4 ± 2.4 versus 12.4 ± 2.1 mmHg), ACA (35.96 ± 11.35 versus 40.25 ± 12.64 degrees), AOD500 (0.800 ± 0.348 versus 0.942 ± 0.387 mm), TISA500 (0.308 ± 0.155 versus 0.374 ± 0.193 mm<sup>2</sup> ), IC (-0.078 ± 0.148 versus -0.153 ± 0.159 mm) and CR (-0.027 ± 0.050 versus -0.054 ± 0.056) changed significantly (all p < 0.001), while the average IT750 (0.463 ± 0.084 versus 0.465 ± 0.086 mm; p = 0.492), ACD (3.171 ± 0.229 versus 3.175 ± 0.238 mm; p = 0.543) and ACW (11.768 ± 0.377 versus 11.755 ± 0.378 mm; p = 0.122) showed no significant change after exercise.The blinking rate did not change significantly during exercise, while ACA, AOD500 and TISA500 increased after exercise. Exercise also induced or increased IC. These changes in anterior chamber structure were only associated with exercise, but not with the postexercise change in PD or IOP.","['anterior chamber structure', 'exercise', 'iris concavity', 'reverse pupillary block']"
The diagnostic value of EBV-DNA and EBV-related antibodies detection for nasopharyngeal carcinoma: a meta-analysis.,"Numerous individual studies have investigated the diagnostic value of EBV-DNA, EA-IgA, VCA-IgA, EBNA1-IgA and Rta-IgG detection for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), but the conclusions remain controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to determine the value of EBV-DNA, EA-IgA, VCA-IgA, EBNA1-IgA and Rta-IgG detection in the diagnosis of NPC.PROSPERO registration number: CRD42019145532. PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Chinese data libraries (Wanfang, CNKI, and CBM) were searched up to January 2019. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and positive likelihood, negative likelihood, and diagnostic odds ratios were conducted in this meta-analysis. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves evaluated the test-performance global summary. Publication bias was examined by Deek's funnel plot asymmetry test.Forty-seven studies with 8382 NPC patients (NPC group) and 15,089 individuals without NPC (Control group) were included in this meta-analysis. The sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood (+ LR), negative likelihood (-LR), DOR and AUC of EBV-DNA in diagnosis of NPC were: 0.76 (95% CI 0.73-0.77), 0.96 (95% CI 0.95-0.97), 14.66 (95% CI 9.97-21.55), 0.19 (95% CI 0.13-0.28), 84 (95% CI 50.45-139.88), 0.96 (SE: 0.001), and 0.55 (95% CI 0.54-0.57), 0.96 (95% CI 0.96-0.97), 12.91 (95% CI 9.55-17.45), 0.35 (95% CI 0.29-0.43), 39.57 (95% CI 26.44-59.23), 0.94 (SE: 0.002) for the EA-IgA, and 0.85 (95% CI 0.84-0.85), 0.89 (95% CI 0.88-0.89), 6.73 (95% CI5.38-8.43), 0.17 (95% CI 0.12-0.23), 43.03 (95% CI 31.51-58.76), 0.93 (SE: 0.007) for the VCA-IgA, and 0.86 (95% CI 0.85-0.88), 0.87 (95% CI 0.88-0.90), 7.55 (95% CI 5.79-9.87), 0.16 (95% CI 0.13-0.19), 50.95 (95% CI 34.35-75.57), 0.94 (SE: 0.008) for the EBNA1-IgA, and 0.70 (95% CI 0.69-0.71), 0.94 (95% CI 0.94-0.95), 9.84 (95% CI 8.40-11.54), 0.25 (95% CI 0.21-0.31), 40.59 (95% CI 32.09-51.35), 0.95 (SE: 0.005) for the Rta-IgG. The EBV-DNA had larger AUC compared with other EBV-based antibodies (P < 0.05), while the difference between EA-IgA, VCA-IgA, EBNA1-IgA and Rta-IgG was not statistically significant (P > 0.05).EBV-DNA, VCA-IgA, EBNA1-IgA and Rta-IgG detection have high accuracy in early diagnosis NPC. In addition, EBV-DNA detection has the higher diagnosis accuracy in NPC. On the other hand, EA-IgA is suitable for the diagnosis but not NPC screening.","['Diagnosis', 'EAIgA', 'EBNA1IgA', 'EBVDNA', 'EpsteinBarr virus', 'Metaanalysis', 'Nasopharyngeal carcinoma', 'RtaIgG', 'VCAIgA']"
Regular medication as a risk factor for intracranial aneurysms: A comparative case-control study.,"Previous medical history strongly contributes to the genesis of intracranial aneurysms (IA). A possible impact of regular medication on the occurrence of abdominal aortic aneurysms has been reported.To evaluate the value of regular medication on the risk of development and rupture of IA.Data on medication use and related comorbidities were obtained from the institutional IA registry. A 1:1 age- and sex-matched patient sample was collected from the population-based Heinz Nixdorf Recall Study with individuals from the same area.In the analysis comparing IA cohort (<i>n</i> = 1960) with the matched normal population (<i>n</i> = 1960), the use of statins (adjusted odds ratio, 1.34 [95% confidence interval 1.02-1.78]), antidiabetics (1.46 [1.08-1.99]), and calcium channel blockers (1.49 [1.11-2.00]) was independently associated with higher risk of IA, whereas uricostatics (0.23 [0.14-0.38]), aspirin (0.23 [0.13-0.43]), beta-blockers (0.51 [0.40-0.66]), and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (0.38 [0.27-0.53]) were related to lower risk of IA. In the multivariable analysis within the IA cohort (<i>n</i> = 2446), SAH patients showed higher drug exposure with thiazide diuretics (2.11 [1.59-2.80]), but lower prevalence of remaining antihypertensive medication-beta-blockers (0.38 [0.30-0.48]), calcium channel blockers (0.63 [0.48-0.83]), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (0.56 [0.44-0.72]), and angiotensin-1 receptor blockers (0.33 [0.24-0.45]). Patients with ruptured IA were less likely to be treated with statins (0.62 [0.47-0.81]), thyroid hormones (0.62 [0.48-0.79]), and aspirin (0.55 [0.41-0.75]).Regular medication might impact the risks related to the development and rupture of IA. Further clinical trials are required to clarify the effect of regular medication on IA genesis.","['comorbidity', 'intracranial aneurysm', 'medication', 'risk', 'subarachnoid hemorrhage']"
Effectiveness of multiple eHealth-delivered lifestyle strategies for preventing or intervening overweight/obesity among children and adolescents: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"To investigate the effect of multiple eHealth-delivered lifestyle interventions on obesity-related anthropometric outcomes in children and adolescents.The Medline (<i>via</i> PubMed), Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CBM, VIP, CNKI, and Wanfang electronic databases were systematically searched from their inception to March 18, 2022, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Meta-analyses were performed to investigate the effect of multiple eHealth-delivered lifestyle interventions on obesity-related anthropometric outcomes (body mass index [BMI], BMI Z-score, waist circumference, body weight, and body fat%). Two independent investigators reviewed the studies for accuracy and completeness. All included studies were evaluated using the Cochrane Risk-of-Bias (ROB) Tool.Forty trials comprising 6,403 patients were selected for the meta-analysis. The eligible trials were published from 2006 to 2022. Compared with the control group, the eHealth-intervention group was more effective in reducing BMI (weighted mean difference [WMD] = -0.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.50 to -0.13, <i>I<sup>2</sup></i> = 85.9%), BMI Z-score (WMD = -0.08, 95% CI: -0.14 to -0.03, <i>I<sup>2</sup></i> = 89.1%), waist circumference (WMD = -0.87, 95% CI: -1.70 to -0.04, <i>I<sup>2</sup></i> = 43.3%), body weight (WMD = -0.96, 95% CI: -1.55 to -0.37, <i>I<sup>2</sup></i> = 0.0%), and body fat% (WMD = -0.59, 95% CI: -1.08 to -0.10, <i>I<sup>2</sup></i> = 0.0%). The subgroup analysis showed that parental or school involvement (WMD = -0.66, 95% CI: -0.98 to -0.34), eHealth-intervention duration of >12 weeks (WMD = -0.67, 95% CI: -0.96 to -0.38), and mobile-based interventions (WMD = -0.78, 95% CI: -1.13 to -0.43) had a significantly greater intervention effect size on BMI.This review recommends that multiple eHealth-delivered lifestyle strategies may be useful for preventing or treating overweight and obesity among children and adolescents. However, our results should be cautiously interpreted due to certain limitations in our study.","['children and adolescents', 'eHealth', 'lifestyle interventions', 'metaanalysis', 'overweight and obesity']"
Meta-analysis of associations between empathy and alcohol use and problems in clinical and non-clinical samples.,"To (1) measure the aggregated effect size of empathy deficits in individuals with alcohol use disorder (AUD) compared with healthy controls, (2) measure the aggregated effect sizes for associations between lower empathy and heavier alcohol consumption and more alcohol problems in non-clinical samples and (3) identify potential moderators on the variability of effect sizes across studies in these meta-analyses.PsycINFO, PubMed and Google Scholar were searched following a pre-registered International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) protocol (CRD42021225392) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology. We meta-analyzed (using random-effects models) mean differences in empathy between individuals with AUD compared with healthy controls and associations between empathy and alcohol consumption and alcohol problems in non-clinical samples. A total of 714 participants were included in the meta-analysis on clinical samples; 3955 were included in the meta-analyses on non-clinical samples.Individuals with AUD reported significantly lower empathy than healthy controls [Hedges' g = -0.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) = -0.91, -0.16, k = 9, P < 0.01, Q = 40.09, I<sup>2</sup>  = 80.04]. Study quality [Q = 1.88, degrees of freedom (d.f.) = 1, P = 0.17] and gender (β = -0.006, Z = -0.60, P = 0.55) were not moderators. Increases in age corresponded to an increase in effect size (β = 0.095, Z = 3.34, P < 0.001). Individuals with AUD (versus healthy controls) had significantly lower cognitive (Hedges' g = -0.44, CI = -0.79, -0.10, P < 0.05), but not affective empathy (Hedges' g = -0.19, CI = -0.51, 0.14, P = 0.27), and the difference between these was significant (Z = 2.34, k = 6, P < 0.01). In non-clinical samples, individuals with lower (versus higher) empathy reported heavier alcohol consumption (r = -0.12, CI = -0.15, -0.09, k = 11, P < 0.001, Q = 9.68, I<sup>2</sup>  = 0.00) and more alcohol problems (r = -0.08, CI = -0.14, -0.01, k = 7, P = 0.021, Q = 6.55, I<sup>2</sup>  = 8.34). There was no significant heterogeneity across studies.Individuals with alcohol use disorder appear to show deficits in empathy compared with healthy controls. Deficits are particularly pronounced for older individuals and for cognitive (versus affective) empathy. In non-clinical samples, lower empathy appears to be associated with heavier alcohol consumption and more alcohol problems.","['Alcohol', 'alcohol problems', 'alcohol use disorder', 'empathy', 'heavy drinking', 'theory of mind']"
"Socially assistive robots for people with dementia: Systematic review and meta-analysis of feasibility, acceptability and the effect on cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms and quality of life.","There is increasing interest in using robots to support dementia care but little consensus on the evidence for their use. The aim of the study is to review evidence about feasibility, acceptability and clinical effectiveness of socially assistive robots used for people with dementia.We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINHAL, IEEE Xplore Digital Library, and EI Engineering Village from inception to 04 - 02-2022 - included primary studies assessing feasibility, acceptability, or effectiveness of socially assistive robots for people with dementia. Two independent reviewers screened studies for eligibility, and assessed quality. Narrative synthesis prioritized higher quality studies, and random-effect meta-analyses compared robots with usual care (UC) or active control (AC) immediately after the intervention (short-term; ST) or long-term (LT) on cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and quality of life.66 studies and four categories of robots were eligible: Companion robots (Pet and humanoid companion robots), telepresence communication robots, homecare assistive robots and multifunctional robots. PARO (companion robot seal) was feasible and acceptable but limited by its weight, cost, and sound. On meta-analysis, PARO had no ST or LT compared to UC or AC over 5-12 weeks on agitation (ST vs UC, 4 trials, 153 participants: pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) 0.25; - 0.57 to 0.06; LT vs UC; 2 trials, 77 participants, SMD = -0.24; - 0.94, 0.46), cognition (ST vs UC, 3 trials, 128 participants: SMD= 0.03; -0.32, 0.38), overall neuropsychiatric symptoms (ST vs UC, 3 trials, 169 participants: SMD= -0.01; -0.32, 0.29; ST vs AC, 2 trials, 145 participants: SMD =0.02, -0.71, 0.85), apathy (ST vs AC, 2 trials, 81 participants: SMD= 0.14; 0.29, 0.58), depression (ST vs UC, 4 trials, 181 participants; SMD= 0.08; -0.52, 0.69; LT vs UC: 2 trials, 77 participants: SMD =0.01; -0.75, 0.77), anxiety (ST vs UC: 2 trials, 104 participants, SMD= 0.24; -0.85, 1.33) and quality of life (ST vs UC, 2 trials, 127 participants: SMD=-0.05; -0.52, 0.42; ST vs AC: 2 trials, 159 participants, SMD =-0.36, -0.76, 0.05). Robotic animals, humanoid companion robots, telepresence robots and multifunctional robots were feasible and acceptable. However, humanoid companion robots have speech recognition problems, and telepresence robots and multifunctional robots were often difficult to use. There was mixed evidence about the feasibility of homecare robots. There was little evidence on any of these robots' effectiveness.Although robots were generally feasible and acceptable, there is no clear evidence that people with dementia derive benefit from robots for cognition, neuropsychiatric symptoms, or quality of life. We recommend that future research should use high quality designs to establish evidence of effectiveness.","['Dementia', 'Depression', 'Neuropsychiatric', 'Older adult', 'Quality of life', 'Robot']"
Prevalence and risk factors associated with malnutrition among adolescents in rural Tanzania.,"To determine the prevalence and risk factors associated with malnutrition among adolescents in a rural Tanzanian community.Cross-sectional survey of 1226 randomly selected adolescents from the Dodoma Health and Demographic Surveillance System (HDSS) in the Chamwino district in the Dodoma region. Anthropometric measurements for weight and height were collected. Height-for-age-z-scores (HAZs) and body mass index (BMI)-for-age-z-scores (BAZs) were computed. Descriptive estimates were documented in graphs and tables, and weighted linear regression models were used to examine predictors of malnutrition.Stunting prevalence was 18%, and thinness prevalence was 14%. Overweight and obesity affected 5.23% of participants. Girls had higher HAZs (β: 0.46, 95% CI 0.33, 0.59, P < 0.0001) and BAZs (β: 0.20, 95% CI 0.05, 0.35, P = 0.0098) than boys. Age was inversely associated with HAZs (β: -0.13, 95% CI -0.17, -0.08, P < 0.0001) and BAZs (β: -0.05, 95% CI -0.10, -0.004, P = 0.0327). Wealth score (β: 0.10, 95% CI 0.04, 0.16, P = 0.0009) and dietary diversity score (β: 0.04, 95% CI 0.01, 0.07, P = 0.0080) were positively associated with HAZs and BAZs. Out-of-school adolescents had higher HAZs (β: -0.49, 95% CI -0.75, -0.23, P = 0.0003) and BAZs (β: -0.68, 95% CI -0.99, -0.37, P < 0.0001) than adolescents who attended school.There are substantial variations of HAZs and BAZs across gender, age, education and wealth, with an emerging burden of overweight and obesity among adolescents in this rural population. Interventions are urgently required to curb both ends of the malnutrition spectrum.","['BAZ', 'BMIforagezscore', 'HAZ', 'adolescents', 'heightforagezscore', 'insuffisance pondérale', 'linear regressions', 'retard de croissance', 'régressions linéaires', 'stunting', 'underweight']"
Risk factors for myopia in a discordant monozygotic twin study.,"Monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs discordant for disease allow careful examination of environmental factors whilst controlling for genetic variation. The purpose of this study was to examine differences in environmental risk factors in MZ twins discordant for myopia.Sixty four MZ twin pairs discordant for refractive error were interviewed. Discordant twins were selected from 1326 MZ twin pairs from the TwinsUK adult twin registry with non-cycloplegic autorefraction. Discordancy was defined as ≥ 2 Dioptres (D) difference in spherical equivalent (SphE) and discordant for class of refractive error. In a 35-item telephone questionnaire twins were separately asked (and scored) about the risk factors urban/rural residence, occupational status and highest educational level. They responded with more (1), less (-1) or the same (0) as their twin on time spent outside, playing outdoor sport, and on close work aged <16 and 16-25 years. The lower SphE twin's score was subtracted from the higher SphE twin's score, and mean values of the difference calculated for each variable.Sixty four twin pairs were included (mean age 56, range 30-79 years; mean difference in refraction 3.35 D, S.D. 1.55 D, median difference 2.78 D). Within discordant MZ twin pairs, the more myopic twin was associated with having a higher occupational status (mean score between 16 and 25 years -0.11; 95% CI -0.19 to -0.04; mean score aged >25 years -0.23, 95% CI -0.28 to -0.17), being resident in urban area (mean score -0.26; 95% CI -0.33 to -0.18) and performing more close work (mean score <16 years -0.11; 95% CI -0.18 to -0.05; mean score aged 16-25 years -0.17, 95% CI -0.24 to -0.10) than their twin. The twins who spent more time outdoors (mean score <16 years 0.09; 95% CI 0.03-0.15; mean score aged 16-25 years 0.28, 95% CI 0.15-0.41) or performed more outdoors sports (mean score <16 years 0.13; 95% CI 0.04-0.21; mean score aged 16-25 years 0.23, 95% CI 0.10-0.36) were less likely to be myopic than their twin.This study has confirmed known environmental risk factors for myopia. These data will allow selection of discordant twins for epigenetic analysis to advance knowledge of mechanisms of refractive error development.","['epigenetics', 'myopia', 'refractive error', 'risk factors']"
Simple isocratic method for simultaneous determination of caffeine and catechins in tea products by HPLC.,"Tea is a popular beverage almost all over the world. Many studies show that tea consumption is closely associated with positive health impact. Most of the HPLC methods used for the determination of tea constituents include gradient elution systems which involve expensive instrumentation. The objective of this study was to develop a simple, rapid precise and low cost HPLC method for the separation and quantification of catechins and caffeine in tea (Camellia sinensis). The method utilizes a phenyl column (2.1 × 150 mm) with a UV-detector (280 nm) where excellent chromatographic separation of tea components i.e. gallic acid (GA), caffeine (Caf), epicatechin (EC) and (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) was achieved. The isocratic elution system of acetonitrile, glacial acetic acid and deionized water (8:1:91 v/v/v) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min was involved. This method produced excellent accuracy and precision. Within run and between run precision was less than 7.5 %. The equations for calibration curves were y = 0.117 (±0.010)x + 0.173 (±0.024), y = 0.100 (±0.003)x + 0.045 (±0.019), y = 0.016 (±0.001)x + 0.006 (±0.004), y = 0.025 (±0.001)x-0.025 (±0.007) for GA, Caf, EC and EGCG respectively. The method validation parameters prove that the method is efficient, a simple and adequate for the quantitative determination of principal components in tea samples.","['Caffeine', 'Catechins', 'HPLC', 'Isocratic method', 'Tea']"
Associations between perioperative sleep patterns and clinical outcomes in patients with intracranial tumors: a correlation study.,"Although the quality of perioperative sleep is gaining increasing attention in clinical recovery, its impact role remains unknown and may deserve further exploration. This study aimed to investigate the associations between perioperative sleep patterns and clinical outcomes among patients with intracranial tumors.A correlation study was conducted in patients with intracranial tumors. Perioperative sleep patterns were assessed using a dedicated sleep monitor for 6 consecutive days. Clinical outcomes were gained through medical records and follow-up. Spearman's correlation coefficient and multiple linear regression analysis were applied to evaluate the associations between perioperative sleep patterns and clinical outcomes.Of 110 patients, 48 (43.6%) were men, with a median age of 57 years. A total of 618 days of data on perioperative sleep patterns were collected and analyzed. Multiple linear regression models revealed that the preoperative blood glucose was positively related to the preoperative frequency of awakenings (β = 0.125; 95% CI = 0.029-0.221; <i>P</i> = 0.011). The level of post-operative nausea and vomiting was negatively related to perioperative deep sleep time (β = -0.015; 95% CI = -0.027--0.003; <i>P</i> = 0.015). The level of anxiety and depression was negatively related to perioperative deep sleep time, respectively (β = -0.048; 95% CI = -0.089-0.008; <i>P</i> = 0.020, β = -0.041; 95% CI = -0.076-0.006; <i>P</i> = 0.021). The comprehensive complication index was positively related to the perioperative frequency of awakenings (β = 3.075; 95% CI = 1.080-5.070; <i>P</i> = 0.003). The post-operative length of stay was negatively related to perioperative deep sleep time (β = -0.067; 95% CI = -0.113-0.021; <i>P</i> = 0.005). The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was positively related to perioperative sleep onset latency (β = 0.097; 95% CI = 0.044-0.150; <i>P</i> < 0.001) and negatively related to perioperative deep sleep time (β = -0.079; 95% CI = -0.122-0.035; <i>P</i> < 0.001).Perioperative sleep patterns are associated with different clinical outcomes. Poor perioperative sleep quality, especially reduced deep sleep time, has a negative impact on clinical outcomes. Clinicians should, therefore, pay more attention to sleep quality and improve it during the perioperative period.http://www.chictr.org.cn, identifier: ChiCTR2200059425.","['clinical outcomes', 'deep sleep', 'intracranial tumors', 'perioperative sleep patterns', 'sleep disorders']"
Comparison of outcomes between novel oral anticoagulants and warfarin monotherapy in patients with left atrial appendage closure: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Pivotal trials of percutaneous left atrial appendage closure (LAAC) used dedicated post-procedure antithrombotic protocols. However, there is no consensus on the selection of new oral anticoagulants (NOAC) and warfarin monotherapy after LAAC. This study aims to compare NOAC with warfarin monotherapy for efficacy and safety in patients undergoing LAAC.A database search was conducted using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, and Clinicaltrials.gov for trials that compared NOAC with warfarin monotherapy after LAAC. The effective outcomes included any major adverse events (all-cause death, stroke, major bleeding) and their individual components. Safety outcomes included all-cause death, major bleeding, total bleeding, DRT, and PDL >5 mm.We included 10 non-randomized clinical trials with 10,337 patients, of whom 4,960 patients received NOAC, while 5,377 patients received warfarin. There were no statistically significant differences in any major adverse events (LogOR: -0.11, 95% CI: -0.27, 0.04, <i>P</i> = 0.16), stroke (LogOR: 0.00, 95% CI: -0.42, 0.42, <i>P</i> = 1.00), all-cause death (LogOR: -0.23, 95% CI: -0.48, 0.02, <i>P</i> = 0.07), major bleeding (LogOR: -0.22, 95% CI: -0.45, 0.01, <i>P</i> = 0.06). NOAC was associated with a significant reduction in total bleeding (LogOR: -1.01, 95% CI: -1.47, -0.55, <i>P</i> < 0.0001) compared to warfarin. No statistically significant differences were found in DRT (LogOR: -0.19, 95% CI: -0.15, 0.52, <i>P</i> = 0.27) and PDL >5 mm (LogOR: 0.19, 95% CI: -0.33, 0.72, <i>P</i> = 0.47). Meta-regression and subgroup analysis showed that total bleeding (LogOR: -1.56, 95% CI: -2.15, -0.97, <i>P</i> < 0.001) was significantly lower in the NOAC group in the subgroup of <75 y.After LAAC, NOAC monotherapy was associated with a lower risk of bleeding compared to warfarin monotherapy for 45 days. There was no significant difference between NOAC and warfarin in terms of other results.www.york.ac.uk/inst/crd, identifier: CRD42022361244.","['Devicerelated thrombus', 'left atrial appendage closure', 'nonvalvular atrial fibrillation', 'novel oral anticoagulant', 'warfarin']"
Assessment of Expression of Regulatory T Cell Differentiation Genes in Autism Spectrum Disorder.,"Dysfunction of regulatory T cells (Tregs) has been shown to affect the etiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Differentiation of this group of T cells has been found to be regulated by a group of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). In this study, we have examined the expression of five lncRNAs that regulate this process in the blood samples of ASD cases compared with controls. These lncRNAs were FOXP3 regulating long intergenic non-coding RNA (FLICR), MAF transcriptional regulator RNA (MAFTRR), NEST (IFNG-AS1), RNA component of mitochondrial RNA processing endoribonuclease (RMRP), and Th2 cytokine locus control region (TH2-LCR). Expression of RMRP was significantly lower in total ASD cases compared to controls [expression ratio (95% CI) = 0.11 (0.08-0.18), adjusted <i>P</i>-value < 0.0001]. This pattern was also detected in both men and women cases compared with corresponding controls [expression ratio (95% CI) = 0.15 (0.08-0.29) and 0.08 (0.03-0.2), respectively]. Likewise, expression of NEST was reduced in total cases and cases among men and women compared with corresponding controls [expression ratio (95% CI) = 0.2 (0.14-0.28); 0.22 (0.12-0.37); and 0.19 (0.09-0.43), respectively; adjusted <i>P</i>-value < 0.0001]. Lastly, FLICR was downregulated in total cases and cases among both boys and girls compared with matched controls [expression ratio (95% CI) = 0.1 (0.06-0.19); 0.19 (0.08-0.46); and 0.06 (0.01-0.21), respectively; adjusted <i>P</i>-value < 0.0001]. These three lncRNAs had appropriate diagnostic power for differentiation of ASD cases from controls. Cumulatively, our study supports dysregulation of Treg-related lncRNAs in patients with ASD and suggests these lncRNAs as proper peripheral markers for ASD.","['ASD', 'FLICR', 'MAFTRR', 'NEST', 'RMRP', 'TH2LCR']"
The causal effect of oxidative stress on the risk of glaucoma.,"Glaucoma is a complex multifactorial disease. Oxidative stress has been implicated in its pathogenesis. However, establishing a causal relationship between oxidative stress and glaucoma is challenging due to confounding and reverse causality. In this study, we performed bidirectional two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses based on genetic instrumental variables as proxies for 11 biomarkers of oxidative stress injury to investigate the causal relationship between oxidative stress and glaucoma. Eight significant associations were identified. Increased circulating levels of catalase (OR = 0.915, 95 % CI: 0.848-0.987, <i>P</i> = 0.022), retinol (OR = 0.481, 95 % CI: 0.248-0.932, <i>P</i> = 0.044) and superoxide dismutase (OR = 0.779, 95 % CI: 0. 616-0.986, <i>P</i> = 0.038) are associated with a decreased risk of glaucoma, whereas an increased myeloperoxidase level (OR = 2.145, 95 % CI: 1.119-4.111, <i>P</i> = 0.029) is associated with an increased risk of glaucoma. Glaucoma was causally associated with lower levels of total bilirubin (OR = 0.961, 95 % CI: 0.927-0.997, <i>P</i> = 0.039), glutathione peroxidase (OR = 0. 934, 95 % CI: 0.890-0.981, <i>P</i> = 0.006), paraoxonase (OR = 0.883, 95 % CI: 0.810-0.963, <i>P</i> = 0.005) and albumin (OR = 0.988, 95 % CI: 0.978-0.998, <i>P</i> = 0.014). The bidirectional MR analysis revealed a causal relationship between oxidative stress and glaucoma. These findings provide a greater understanding of the underlying mechanisms of glaucomatous neurodegeneration and imply a potential therapeutic approach for glaucoma through targeting oxidative stress pathways.","['Glaucoma', 'Mendelian randomization study', 'Oxidative stress']"
The Prediction Analysis of Autistic and Schizotypal Traits in Attentional Networks.,"Empirical findings confirmed that autistic and schizotypal traits are associated with attentional function as well as include various dimensions. So far, no study has reported which dimension of these traits relates to attentional networks. This study aimed to find out whether there are associations between attentional networks and autistic traits; and between attentional networks and schizotypal traits.A total of 449 volunteers was included in this study, and autism-spectrum quotient (AQ), schizotypal personality questionnaire (SPQ), and attention network test (ANT) were used to measure autistic traits and schizotypal traits. The three independent attentional networks, including alerting network, orienting network, and executive control network, were also measured.Autistic traits were associated with the orienting network, whereas schizotypal traits were associated with the orienting network and executive control network. Furthermore, attentional networks could be predicted by specific dimensions of autistic and schizotypal traits. AQ-attention switching [0.104 (-1.175- -0.025), p=0.041] and AQ-attention to detail [-0.097 (-0.798- -0.001), p=0.049] were significant predictors of orienting network and gender were significant predictor of executive network (Beta=0.107; 95% CI=-0.476-10.139; p=0.031). Whereas, schizotypal dimension ""interpersonal"" was a significant predictor of all three attentional networks [Alerting: 0.147 (-0.010-0.861), p=0.045; Orienting: 0.147 (0.018-0.733), p=0.040; Executive: 0.198 (0.215-1.309), p=0.006].This study demonstrated that autistic and schizotypal traits were associated with attentional networks. The specific dimensions of autistic and schizotypal traits could predict attentional networks. Nevertheless, the attentional networks predicted with these two traits were different.","['Attentional networks', 'Autistic traits', 'Schizotypal traits']"
Associations between Multimodal Fitness Assessments and Rowing Ergometer Performance in Collegiate Female Athletes.,"The purpose was to examine the association of critical power from a three-minute all-out row (CP<sub>3-min</sub>) and peak power from a one-stroke maximum test (1-Stroke) with laboratory-based fitness assessments (peak oxygen consumption [V.O<sub>2peak</sub>] and Wingate anaerobic test [WAnT]) and 6000 m (6K) and 2000 m (2K) rowing ergometer performance. Thirty-one female collegiate rowers (20.2 ± 1.1 years, 70.9 ± 6.9 kg, and 172.2 ± 4.8 cm) participated in fitness and rowing performance testing. Pearson's correlations, linear regression, and Cohen's <i>q</i> were used to determine statistical relationships. Absolute V.O<sub>2peak</sub> values displayed significant correlations with 6K<sub>total</sub> (-0.68), 6K<sub>split</sub> (-0.68), 2K<sub>total</sub> (-0.64), and 2K<sub>split</sub> (-0.43). Relative V.O<sub>2peak</sub> displayed significant correlations with 6K<sub>total</sub> (-0.36), and 6K<sub>split</sub> (-0.37). CP<sub>3-min</sub> demonstrated significant correlations with 6K<sub>total</sub> (-0.62), 6K<sub>split</sub> (-0.62), 2K<sub>total</sub> (-0.61), and 2K<sub>split</sub> (-0.99). For 2K<sub>split</sub>, a significant difference was observed between relative V.O<sub>2peak</sub> and CP<sub>3-min</sub> correlations with a ""large"" effect size (<i>q</i> = 2.367). Furthermore, 1-Stroke showed significant associations with 6K<sub>total</sub> (-0.63), 6K<sub>split</sub> (-0.63), 2K<sub>total</sub> (-0.62), and 2K<sub>split</sub> (-0.44), while WAnT produced non-significant correlations. Absolute V.O<sub>2peak</sub> CP<sub>3-min</sub> accounted for significant proportions of variance observed with performance measures (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Practitioners should consider incorporating CP<sub>3-min</sub> and 1-Stroke as additional tests for gauging rowing performance.","['3min allout', 'aerobic capacity', 'anaerobic power', 'critical power', 'maximal oxygen uptake']"
"Bleeding Risk Prediction in Patients Treated with Antithrombotic Drugs According to the Anatomic Site of Bleeding, Indication for Treatment, and Time Since Treatment Initiation.","<b>Background</b>  Reasons for the relatively poor performance of bleeding prediction models are not well understood but may relate to differences in predictors for various anatomical sites of bleeding. <b>Methods</b>  We pooled individual participant data from four randomized controlled trials of antithrombotic therapy in patients with coronary and peripheral artery diseases, embolic stroke of undetermined source (ESUS), or atrial fibrillation. We examined discrimination and calibration of models for any major bleeding, major gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding, and intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), according to the time since initiation of antithrombotic therapy, and indication for antithrombotic therapy. <b>Results</b>  Of 57,813 patients included, 1,948 (3.37%) experienced major bleeding, including 717 (1.24%) major GI bleeding and 274 (0.47%) ICH. The model derived to predict major bleeding at 1 year from any site (c-index, 0.69, 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-0.71) performed similarly when applied to predict major GI bleeding (0.71, 0.69-0.74), but less well to predict ICH (0.64, 0.61-0.69). Models derived to predict GI bleeding (0.75, 0.74-0.78) and ICH (0.72, 0.70-0.79) performed better than the general major bleeding model. Discrimination declined over time since the initiation of antithrombotic treatment, stabilizing at approximately 2 years for any major bleeding and major GI bleeding and 1 year for ICH. Discrimination was best for the model predicting ICH in the ESUS population (0.82, 0.78-0.92) and worst for the model predicting any major bleeding in the coronary and peripheral artery disease population (0.66, 0.65-0.69). <b>Conclusion</b>  Performance of risk prediction models for major bleeding is affected by site of bleeding, time since initiation of antithrombotic therapy, and indication for antithrombotic therapy.","['ESUS', 'CAD', 'PAD', 'antithrombotic', 'atrial fibrillation', 'bleeding', 'risk prediction']"
Effects of CYP3A4*22 and POR*28 variations on the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus in renal transplant recipients: a meta-analysis of 18 observational studies.,"This study aimed to investigate the association between cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4*22 and cytochrome P450 oxidoreductase (POR)*28 variations and the pharmacokinetics of tacrolimus.Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Web of Science (SCI), MEDLINE, and Embase were systematically searched from inception to August 2022. The outcomes were weight-adjusted daily dose and dose-adjusted trough concentration (C<sub>0</sub>/Dose).The study included 2931 renal transplant recipients from 18 publications. Weight-adjusted daily dose of CYP3A4*1/*1 carriers was 0.04 (WMD = 0.04, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.06), 0.03 (WMD = 0.03, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.05), 0.02 (WMD = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.01 to 0.03), or 0.02 mg/kg/day (WMD = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.04) higher than CYP3A4*22 carriers in Caucasians at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, or 12 months post-transplantation. Conversely, C0/Dose was lower for CYP3A4*1/*1 carriers at 3 days (SMD = -0.35, 95% CI: -0.65 to -0.06), 1 month (SMD = -0.67, 95% CI: -1.16 to -0.18), 3 months (SMD = -0.60, 95% CI: -0.89 to -0.31), 6 months (SMD = -0.76, 95% CI: -1.49 to -0.04), or 12 months post-transplantation (SMD = -0.69, 95% CI: -1.37 to 0.00). Furthermore, C<sub>0</sub>/Dose of POR*1/*1 carriers was 22.64 (WMD = 22.64, 95% CI: 2.54 to 42.74) or 19.41 (ng/ml)/(mg/kg/day) (WMD = 19.41, 95% CI: 9.58 to 29.24) higher than POR*28 carriers in CYP3A5 expressers at 3 days or 7 days post-transplantation, and higher in Asians at 6 months post-transplantation (SMD = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.50 to 1.43).CYP3A4*22 variant in Caucasians restrains the metabolism of tacrolimus, while POR*28 variant in CYP3A5 expressers enhances the metabolism of tacrolimus for renal transplant recipients. However, further well-designed prospective studies are necessary to substantiate these conclusions given some limitations.","['Genetic polymorphisms', 'Metaanalysis', 'Pharmacokinetics', 'Renal transplant recipients', 'Tacrolimus']"
The mediating role of psychological capital in the association between life satisfaction and depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic: a cross-sectional study.,"Although life satisfaction is a predictor of depressive and anxiety symptoms, the mechanisms underlying this association are poorly understood. This study examined how psychological capital (PsyCap), a positive psychological state, mediated the association between life satisfaction and depressive and anxiety symptoms among Chinese medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic.A cross-sectional survey was conducted at three medical universities in China. A self-administered questionnaire was distributed to 583 students. Depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, life satisfaction, and PsyCap were measured anonymously. A hierarchical linear regression analysis was performed to explore the effects of life satisfaction on depressive and anxiety symptoms. Asymptotic and resampling strategies were used to examine how PsyCap mediates the association between life satisfaction and depressive and anxiety symptoms.Life satisfaction was positively associated with PsyCap and its four components. There were significant negative associations between life satisfaction, psychological capital, resilience, optimism, and depressive and anxiety symptoms among medical students. Self-efficacy was negatively associated with depressive and anxiety symptoms. Psychological capital (a×b = -0.3201, BCa 95% CI: -0.3899, -0.2446; a×b = -0.2749, BCa 95% CI: -0.3817, -0.1996), resilience (a×b = -0.2103, BCa 95% CI: -0.2727, -0.1580; a×b = -0.1871, BCa 95% CI: -0.2520, -0.1414), optimism (a×b = -0.2100, BCa 95% CI: -0.3388, -0.1150; a×b = -0.1998, BCa 95% CI: -0.3307, -0.0980), and self-efficacy (a×b = -0.0916, BCa 95% CI: 0.0048, 0.11629; a×b = 0.1352, BCa 95% CI: 0.0336, 0.2117) significantly mediated the association between life satisfaction and depressive and anxiety symptoms.This was a cross-sectional study, and causal relationships between the variables could not be ascertained. Self-reported questionnaire instruments were used for data collection, which may have recall bias.Life satisfaction and PsyCap can be used as positive resources to reduce depressive and anxiety symptoms among third-year Chinese medical students during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychological capital and its components (self-efficacy, resilience, and optimism) partially mediated the relationship between life satisfaction and depressive symptoms, and completely mediated the relationship between life satisfaction and anxiety symptoms. Therefore, improving life satisfaction and investing in psychological capital (especially self-efficacy, resilience, and optimism) should be included in the prevention and treatment of depressive and anxiety symptoms among third-year Chinese medical students. Additional attention is needed to pay for self-efficacy in such disadvantageous contexts.","['Anxiety symptoms', 'COVID19', 'Depressive symptoms', 'Life satisfaction', 'Medical students', 'Psychological capital']"
"The Association of Folic Acid, Iron Nutrition during Pregnancy and Congenital Heart Disease in Northwestern China: A Matched Case-Control Study.","<b>Background</b>: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between folic acid and iron nutrition during pregnancy and congenital heart disease (CHD) in the offspring. <b>Methods</b>: Conditional logistic regression models and nonlinear mixed-effects models were used to analyze the effects of folic acid and iron nutrition during pregnancy on CHD in offspring. <b>Results</b>: After adjusting for confounders, folic acid or iron supplementation during pregnancy reduced the risk for fetal CHD (<i>OR</i> = 0.60 (0.45, 0.82) or 0.36 (0.27, 0.48)). Similarly, dietary iron intake during pregnancy (≥29 mg/d) was associated with a reduced risk of fetal CHD (<i>OR</i> = 0.64 (0.46, 0.88)). Additionally, compared with women who only supplemented folic acid (<i>OR</i> = 0.59 (0.41, 0.84)) or iron (<i>OR</i> = 0.32 (0.16, 0.60)), women who supplemented both folic acid and iron had lower risk for newborns with CHD (<i>OR</i> = 0.22 (0.15, 0.34)). Similarly, compared with women who only supplemented folic acid (<i>OR</i> = 0.59 (0.41, 0.84)) or higher dietary iron intake (≥29 mg/d) (<i>OR</i> = 0.60 (0.33, 1.09)), women who supplemented both folic acid and higher dietary iron intake (≥29 mg/d) had lower risk for the newborn with CHD (<i>OR</i> = 0.41 (0.28, 0.62)). The combined effects were significant in the multiplication model (<i>OR</i> = 0.35 (0.26, 0.48) or 0.66 (0.50, 0.85)) but not in the additive model. <b>Conclusions</b>: Our study found that folic acid and iron nutrition during pregnancy were associated with a reduced risk of CHD in the offspring and confirmed a statistically significant multiplicative interaction between folic acid and iron nutrition on the reduced risk of CHD in offspring.","['congenital heart disease', 'folic acid', 'interaction', 'iron nutrition']"
Mirabegron and antimuscarinics for treating ureteral stent-related symptoms: a systematic review and meta-analysis of RCTs.,"<b>Objective:</b> We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the efficacy and safety of mirabegron (50 mg/day) and antimuscarinics in treating ureteral stent-related symptoms (SRSs). <b>Methods:</b> All randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were identified by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The RevMan version 5.3.0 software was used for statistical analysis. <b>Results:</b> This meta-analysis included five RCTs involving 317 patients. A fixed effects model revealed that mirabegron was superior to antimuscarinics in treating urinary symptoms (MD -1.39, 95% CI -2.63 to -0.15, <i>p</i> = 0.03) and general health (MD -1.65, 95% CI -2.60 to -0.69, <i>p</i> = 0.0007) 1 week after treatment initiation. We observed no significant differences in body pain (MD 0.05, 95% CI -1.06 to 1.15, <i>p</i> = 0.94), work performance (MD -0.86, 95% CI -1.77 to 0.06, <i>p</i> = 0.07), and sexual matters (MD 0.03, 95% CI -0.77 to 0.83, <i>p</i> = 0.94). Two weeks after treatment initiation, the ureteral stent symptom questionnaire (USSQ) revealed no significant differences between the two groups. The mirabegron group demonstrated a significant improvement in the quality of life (QoL) (MD -0.18, 95% CI -0.34 to -0.01, <i>p</i> = 0.03), while the International Prostate Symptom Score did not reveal a significant difference between the two groups (MD -0.74, 95% CI -1.79 to 0.32, <i>p</i> = 0.17). Regarding safety, a pooled data analysis presented that the incidence of constipation was lower in the mirabegron group (OR 0.10, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.77, <i>p</i> = 0.03). The mirabegron and antimuscarinics groups did not differ significantly concerning the risk of dry mouth (OR 0.15, 95% CI 0.02 to 1.27, <i>p</i> = 0.08). <b>Conclusion:</b> Mirabegron is superior to antimuscarinics in alleviating ureteral SRSs and improving QoL. Additionally, mirabegron 50 mg/day presented safety with a lower incidence of constipation.","['Ureteral Stent Symptom Questionnaire', 'antimuscarinics', 'metaanalysis', 'mirabegron', 'ureteral stentrelated symptoms']"
Facial emotion identification impairments in Chinese persons living with schizophrenia: A meta-analysis.,"Facial emotion identification (FEI) deficits are associated with impaired social functioning in persons living with schizophrenia (PLwS), but the research on emotion-specific FEI deficits remains inconclusive. Furthermore, existing studies on FEI deficits are limited by their small sample sizes. We performed a meta-analysis of studies comparing the FEI abilities between Chinese PLwS and healthy controls in terms of the six basic facial emotions (happiness, sadness, fear, disgust, anger, and surprise), as well as contempt, calmness, and neutral facial expressions.Major Chinese- and English-language databases were searched to retrieve case-control studies that compared the FEI task performance between Chinese PLwS and healthy controls (HCs) and reported the emotion-specific correct identification scores for PLwS and HCs. The Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for Case-control Studies (""JBI checklist,"" hereafter) was used to assess the risk of bias (RoB) of the included studies. Statistical analysis was performed using the ""meta"" package of R 4.1.2.Twenty-three studies with a total of 28 case-control cohorts and 1,894 PLwS and 1,267 HCs were included. The RoB scores of the included studies ranged from two to seven. PLwS had statistically significantly lower FEI scores than HCs and the corresponding emotion-specific pooled standard mean differences (95% confidence intervals) were -0.69 (-0.88, -0.50) for happiness, -0.88 (-1.12, -0.63) for sadness, -1.44 (-1.83, -1.06) for fear, -1.18 (-1.60, -0.76) for disgust, -0.91 (-1.24, -0.57) for anger, -1.09 (-1.39, -0.78) for surprise, -0.26 (-0.51, -0.01) for contempt, -0.31 (-0.52, -0.09) for calmness, and -0.42 (-0.65, -0.18) for neutral. In the analyses of sources of heterogeneity, drug-naïve status, clinical setting, positive and negative psychotic symptoms, and RoB were significant moderators of the magnitudes of FEI deficits.Chinese PLwS have significant FEI impairments in terms of recognizing the six basic facial emotions, contempt, calmness, and neutral emotions, and the magnitude of impairment varies depending on the type of emotion, clinical characteristics, and the level of RoB of the study. It is necessary to consider the characteristics of FEI deficits and the clinical moderators in the FEI deficits to develop remediation strategies targeting FEI deficits in schizophrenia.","['Chinese', 'casecontrol studies', 'facial emotion identification', 'metaanalysis', 'schizophrenia']"
Sex and N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide: The potential mediating role of iron biomarkers.,"Levels of N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), a marker of heart failure and cardiovascular risk, are generally higher in women than men. We explored whether iron biomarkers mediate sex differences in NT-proBNP levels.We included 5,343 community-dwelling individuals from the Prevention of Renal and Vascular Endstage Disease study. With linear regression analyses, we investigated the association of sex and iron biomarkers with NT-proBNP levels, independent of adjustment for potential confounders. The assessed iron biomarkers included ferritin, transferrin saturation (TSAT), hepcidin, and soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR). Next, we performed mediation analyses to investigate to which extent iron biomarkers influence the association between sex and NT-proBNP.Of the included 5,343 participants, the mean standard deviation age was 52.2 ± 11.6 years and 52% were females. After adjustment for potential confounders, women compared to men, had higher NT-proBNP (β = 0.31; 95%CI = 0.29, 0.34), but lower ferritin (β = -0.37; 95%CI = -0.39, -0.35), hepcidin (β = -0.22, 95%CI = -0.24, -0.20), and TSAT (β = -0.07, 95% CI = -0.08, -0.06). Lower ferritin (β = -0.05, 95%CI = -0.08, -0.02), lower hepcidin (β = -0.04, 95%CI = -0.07, -0.006), and higher TSAT (β = 0.07; 95%CI = 0.01, 0.13) were associated with higher NT-proBNP. In mediation analyses, ferritin and hepcidin explained 6.5 and 3.1% of the association between sex and NT-proBNP, respectively, while TSAT minimally suppressed (1.9%) this association.Our findings suggest that iron biomarkers marginally explain sex differences in levels of NT-proBNP. Future studies are needed to explore causality and potential mechanisms underlying these pathways.","['NTproBNP', 'cardiac markers', 'general population', 'iron biomarkers', 'iron status', 'natriuretic peptides', 'sex']"
Dance activity interventions targeting cognitive functioning in older adults with mild cognitive impairment: A meta-analysis.,"To comprehensively determine the effect of dance activities on the cognitive functions and its sub-domains of older adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).We obtained data from PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, China national knowledge infrastructure, Wanfang data, and VIP databases from 2017/01/01 to 2022/03/01. We included trials of older adults with MCI that underwent dance activity intervention and fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Two researchers independently assessed the quality of the study using the Cochrane risk of the bias assessment tool. Meta-analysis was performed when data were available, with further subgroup analysis, using Review Manager 5.4, and sensitivity analysis was performed using Stata software 15.1.Search terms yielded 183 articles, of which 12 fulfilled the inclusion criteria. This included 7 high-quality studies and 5 medium-quality studies. A total of 820 older adults were analyzed. Results showed that dance activity had beneficial effects for global cognition [SMD<sub>MMSE</sub> = 0.65, 95% CI<sub>MMSE</sub> (0.20, 1.09), <i>p</i> <sub>MMSE</sub> = 0.004; SMD<sub>MoCA</sub> = 0.87, 95% CI<sub>MoCA</sub> (0.44, 1.29), <i>p</i> <sub>MoCA</sub> < 0.0001], memory [SMD = 0.61, 95% CI (0.35, 0.88), <i>p</i> < 0.00001], visuospatial function [SMD = -0.39, 95% CI (-0.60, -0.19), <i>p</i> = 0.0002], cognitive flexibility [SMD = -0.31, 95% CI (-0.52, -0.11), <i>p</i> = 0.003], attention [SMD = 0.34, 95% CI (0.07, 0.61), <i>p</i> = 0.01], and balance [SMD = 1.25, 95% CI (0.06, 2.44), <i>p</i> = 0.04]. Further subgroup analysis showed that open-skill dance activity (OSDA) was more effective in promoting global cognition in older adults with MCI than closed-skill dance activity (CSDA) because of the different stimulation provided by the two types of dance activities in the brain regions of the older adults (<i>p</i> = 0.0002). It could be speculated that dance activity improved cognitive function mainly by affecting the microstructure and function of the cingulate tract, hippocampus, cardiovascular function, and other brain areas of older adults with MCI.Dance activities can significantly improve global cognition, memory, visuospatial function, cognitive flexibility, attention, and balance in older adults with MCI. However, more trials with rigorous study designs are necessary to provide more concrete evidence in the future.","['MCI', 'cognitive function', 'dance activity', 'dance exercise', 'metaanalysis']"
Factors Associated with Consistent Condom Use Among Women Engaged in Sex Work: Lessons From the Kyaterekera Study in Southwestern Uganda.,"We examined the factors associated with consistent condom use among women engaged in sex work in the Southern parts of Uganda. We used baseline data from a longitudinal study involving WESW from 19 hotspots in Southern Uganda. We conducted hierarchical models to determine the individual, economic, behavioral, and health-related factors associated with consistent condom use. We found that, alcohol use (b=-0.48, 95% CI=-0.77, -0.19), accepting money for condomless sex (b=-0.33, 95% CI=-0.38, -0.28), multiple customers (b=-0.01, 95% CI=-0.01, -0.005), being married (b = 0.50, 95% CI = 0.01, 0.99), owning more assets (b = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.05, 0.13), having another income earner in the household (b = 0.55, 95% CI = 0.27, 0.83), condom use self-efficacy (b = 0.11, 95% CI = 0.03, 0.19), condom use communication (b = 0.06, 95% CI = 0.001, 0.12), and being knowledgeable about HIV/STIs transmission (b = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.01, 0.15) were associated with consistent condom use. Additionally, 29% of the women were consistent condom users. Hence, there is need to implement interventions that promote consistent condom use among WESW.","['Consistent condom use', 'Women engaged in sex work WESW']"
Associations between psychiatric polygenic risk scores and general and specific psychopathology symptoms in childhood and adolescence between and within dizygotic twin pairs.,"Although polygenic risk scores (PRS) predict psychiatric problems, these associations might be attributable to indirect pathways including population stratification, assortative mating, or dynastic effects (mediation via parental environments). The goal of this study was to examine whether PRS-psychiatric symptom associations were attributable to indirect versus direct pathways.The sample consisted of 3,907 dizygotic (DZ) twin pairs. In childhood, their parents rated them on 98 symptoms. In adolescence (n = 2,393 DZ pairs), both the parents and the twins rated themselves on 20 symptoms. We extracted one general and seven specific factors from the childhood data, and one general and three specific factors from the adolescent data. We then regressed each general factor model onto ten psychiatric PRS simultaneously. We first conducted the regressions between individuals (β) and then within DZ twin pairs (β<sub>w</sub> ), which controls for indirect pathways.In childhood, the PRS for ADHD predicted general psychopathology (β = 0.09, 95% CI: [0.06, 0.12]; β<sub>w</sub>  = 0.07 [0.01, 0.12]). Furthermore, the PRS for ADHD predicted specific inattention (β = 0.04 [0.00, 0.08]; β<sub>w</sub>  = 0.09 [0.01, 0.17]) and specific hyperactivity (β = 0.07 [0.04, 0.11]; β<sub>w</sub>  = 0.09 [0.01, 0.16]); the PRS for schizophrenia predicted specific learning (β = 0.08 [0.03, 0.13]; β<sub>w</sub>  = 0.19 [0.08, 0.30]) and specific inattention problems (β = 0.05 [0.01, 0.09]; β<sub>w</sub>  = 0.10 [0.02, 0.19]); and the PRS for neuroticism predicted specific anxiety (β = 0.06 [0.02, 0.10]; β<sub>w</sub>  = 0.06 [0.00, 0.12]). Overall, the PRS-general factor associations were similar between individuals and within twin pairs, whereas the PRS-specific factors associations amplified by 84% within pairs.This implies that PRS-psychiatric symptom associations did not appear attributable to indirect pathways such as population stratification, assortative mating, or mediation via parental environments. Rather, genetics appeared to directly influence symptomatology.","['General factor of psychopathology', 'genetic nurture', 'multipolygenic score', 'polygenic risk scores']"
Hypothetical Interventions for Falls Among Older Adults: An Application of the Parametric G-Formula.,"<b>Introduction:</b> Falls, which have a higher incidence and mortality due to accidental injuries, are a major global health challenge. The effects of lifestyle factor, health indicator, psychological condition, and functional status interventions on the risk of falls are unknown and the conventional regression model would not adjust for the confounders. This study aimed to evaluate the 4-year risk of falls on the basis of these hypothetical interventions among Chinese older adults. <b>Methods:</b> Data were obtained from 9,692 aged 65 years and over older adults in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study wave, from 2011 to 2015. We used the parametric g-formula to evaluate the risk of falls on the basis of independent hypothetical interventions of sleep duration, social activities, smoking status, drinking status, body mass index (BMI), systolic blood pressure (SBP), vision, depression, activities of daily living (ADL), and their different joint intervention combinations. <b>Results:</b> During the follow-up of 4 years, we documented 1,569 falls. The observed risk of falls was 23.58%. The risk ratios (95% confidence intervals [CIs]) of falls under the intensive hypothetical interventions on increasing sleep duration, participating in more social activities, quit smoking and drinking, reducing BMI and SBP, better vision, alleviating depressive symptoms, and improving ADL capability were 0.93 (0.87-0.96), 0.88 (0.79-0.92), 0.98 (0.95-1.03), 0.97 (0.95-1.02), 0.92 (0.86-1.03), 0.93 (0.87-1.04), 0.86 (0.74-0.91), 0.91 (0.85-0.96), and 0.79 (0.74-0.85), respectively. The feasible and intensive joint hypothetical intervention reduced the 4-year fall risk by 22% (95% CI: 0.52-0.91) and 33% (95% CI: 0.56-0.72), respectively. <b>Conclusions:</b> Hypothetical interventions for increasing sleep duration, participating in more social activities, better vision, alleviating depressive symptoms, and improving ADL capability help protect older adults from falls. Our findings suggest that a combination of lifestyle factors, health indicators, psychological conditions, and functional status may prove to be an effective strategy for preventing falls among older adults.","['falls', 'gformula', 'hypothetical intervention', 'older adults', 'primary prevention']"
Is D-dimer a reliable biomarker compared to ESR and CRP in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection?,"The diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) has always been challenging. Recently, D-dimer has become a promising biomarker in diagnosing PJI. However, there is controversy regarding its diagnostic value. We aim to investigate the diagnostic value of D-dimer in comparison to ESR and CRP.PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched in February 2020 to identify articles reporting on the diagnostic value of D-dimer on PJI. Pooled analysis was conducted to investigate the diagnostic value of D-dimer, CRP, and ESR.Six studies with 1,255 cases were included (374 PJI cases and 881 non-PJI cases). Overall D-dimer showed sensitivity of 0.80 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69 to 0.87) and specificity of 0.76 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.86). Sub-group analysis by excluding patients with thrombosis and hyper-coagulation disorders showed sensitivity of 0.82 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.90) and specificity of 0.80 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.88). Serum D-dimer showed sensitivity of 0.85 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.92), specificity of 0.83 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.90). Plasma D-dimer showed sensitivity of 0.67 (95% CI 0.60 to 0.73), specificity of 0.58 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.72). CRP showed sensitivity of 0.78 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.83), specificity of 0.81 (95% CI 0.72 to 0.87). ESR showed sensitivity of 0.68 (95% CI 0.63 to 0.73), specificity of 0.83 (95% CI 0.78 to 0.87).In patients without thrombosis or a hyper-coagulation disorder, D-dimer has a higher diagnostic value compared to CRP and ESR. In patients with the aforementioned conditions, D-dimer has higher sensitivity but lower specificity compared to ESR and CRP. We do not recommend the use of serum D-dimer in patients with thrombosis and hyper-coagulation disorders for diagnosing PJI. Serum D-dimer may perform better than plasma D-dimer. Further studies are needed to compare serum D-dimer and plasma D-dimer in arthroplasty patients.
